In [[Wales]], an '''Act of the National Assembly for Wales''' ({{lang-cy|Deddf Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru}}) (informally, an '''Act of the Assembly''') is [[primary legislation]] that can be made by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] under part 4 of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]].&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/part/4 |title=Government of Wales Act 2006 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power to make Acts of the Assembly was conferred on the assembly following the [[2011 elections]] as a commencement order had been passed in the assembly by simple majority prior to dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12639379 |title=BBC News - What happens next after the assembly powers referendum? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-03-05 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation of part 4 legislative powers was as a result of a "yes" vote in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|2011 referendum]] held in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12482561 |title=BBC News - Wales Referendum 2011: Results in full |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the power to make Acts of the Assembly commenced, the assembly lost the ability to make [[Measure of the National Assembly for Wales|Measures]] under part 3 of the 2006 Act. Existing Measures will remain as law unless repealed.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt;

==How Acts of the Assembly are made==
[[File:Royal Badge of Wales (2008).svg|right|150px|thumb|The [[Royal Badge of Wales]] appears on the covers of Acts passed by the [[Welsh Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2012/2/introduction/enacted|title=Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act 2012|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Consideration by the Assembly===
Bills may be introduced by [[Welsh Government]], a committee of the Assembly, the Assembly Commission or by individual Assembly Members. Ballots are held to select which individual assembly members may present bills. 

Once a bill is introduced, there are four stages that need to be completed prior to the bill being submitted for [[royal assent]]. The first stage involves consideration of the general principles of the bill by a committee of the assembly and then agreement of these principles by the assembly in plenary session. In the second stage, the bill is considered in detail by a bill committee. The third stage involves detailed consideration of the bill and any amendments by the assembly in plenary, this can be followed by a Report Stage where further amendments can be proposed. Finally, in the fourth stage, the assembly votes to pass the bill in its final form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.wales/en/bus-home/bus-legislation/bus-legislation-guidance/Pages/bus-legislation-guidance.aspx|title=Guide to the Legislative Process|author=|date=|website=assembly.wales|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of intimation and Royal Assent===
When a bill completes its passage through the assembly, it enters a four-week period of intimation, during which the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] or the [[Counsel General for Wales]] may refer the bill to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] if they consider that any provisions of the bill are outside the legislative competency of the assembly. The [[Secretary of State for Wales]] may also make an order prohibiting the Clerk to the Assembly from submitting the Bill for royal assent during this time. After the period of intimation expires, the Clerk may submit the bill for royal assent. The bill becomes an Act of the Assembly when [[Letters Patent]] under the [[Welsh Seal]] are made by the Queen to signify assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/part/4/crossheading/procedure |title=Government of Wales Act 2006 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/752/made |title=The National Assembly for Wales (Letters Patent) Order 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Form of letters patent====
Royal assent to Acts of the Assembly is given by means of [[Letters Patent]] using the following wording:&lt;ref name="Wales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/752/pdfs/uksi_20110752_en.pdf|title=The National Assembly for Wales (Letters Patent) Order 2011|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=11 October 2016|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''FORASMUCH as one or more Bills have been passed by the National Assembly for Wales and have been submitted to Us for Our Royal Assent by the Clerk of the National Assembly for Wales in accordance with the Government of Wales Act 2006 the short Titles of which Bills are set forth in the Schedule hereto but those Bills by virtue of the Government of Wales Act 2006 do not become Acts of the National Assembly for Wales nor have effect in the Law without Our Royal Assent signified by Letters Patent under Our Welsh Seal signed with Our own hand We have therefore caused these Our Letters Patent to be made and have signed them and by them do give Our Royal Assent to those Bills which shall be taken and accepted as good and perfect Acts of the Assembly and be put in due execution accordingly COMMANDING ALSO the Keeper of Our Welsh Seal to seal these Our Letters with that Seal.''&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''Addis Ababa Agreement''', also known as the [[Addis Ababa]] Accord, was a set of compromises within a 1972 treaty that ended the [[First Sudanese Civil War]]  (1955–1972) fighting in [[Sudan]]. The Addis Ababa accords were incorporated in the [[Constitution of Sudan]].

==Preliminaries and Negotiations==
Direct Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the [[Anyanya| Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM)]] in Addis Ababa were preceded in 1971 by a series of discussions through the intermediation of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches| All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC)]] and [[World Council of Churches| World Council of Churches (WCC)]].  In Addis Ababa, in 1972, [[Abel Alier]] led the delegation representing the Government of Sudan.  [[Ezboni Mondiri]] led the delegation of the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9NIrNTedJkC&amp;pg=PA188 |title=Eastern African history |first=Robert O. |last=Collins |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |year=1991 |ISBN=1-55876-016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negotiations were moderated by [[Burgess Carr]], who was then the Secretary General of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Juba University |editor-first=Rift Valley Institute |title=We Have Lived Too Long to Be Deceived: South Sudanese discuss the lessons of historic peace agreements  |url= http://riftvalley.net/publication/we-have-lived-too-long-be-deceived|location= London, UK |publisher=Rift Valley Institute |date=2015 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Agreement had the goal to address and appease concerns of the southern Sudan liberation and secession movement, as the First Sudanese Civil War grew costly in lives and resources to the northern Sudanese government and southern population. The Addis Ababa Agreement's establishment of the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (1972–83)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] gave a degree of [[autonomy]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sudan.html#Southern&lt;/ref&gt; It meant South Sudan would no longer be divided into the three separate regions Al-Istiwāʾiyyah (Equatoria), Baḥr al-Ghazāl, and Aʿālī al-Nīl (Upper Nile). The region would run itself through a separate legislative and executive body. The soldiers of the Anya Nya would be integrated into the Sudanese army and police force. The Addis Ababa Agreement gave Nimeri popularity and prestige both within Sudan and outside of the country. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan/The-Addis-Ababa-Agreement#ref48975&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade of relative peace followed, though the Addis Ababa Agreement failed to dispel the tensions that had originally caused civil war.  The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Resource infringements and marginalisation by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the late 1970s.

==Termination==
In 1983 President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] declared all Sudan an [[Islamic state]] under [[Shari'a]] law, including the non-Islamic majority southern region. The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052232/http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiated the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005).

{{Youth rights sidebar}}
The '''age of consent''' is the age below which a minor is considered to be [[legally incompetent]] to consent to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]]. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was [[Consent|consensual]], and such sexual activity may be considered [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances.

The term ''age of consent'' rarely appears in legal [[statute]]s.&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}} Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to [[marriageable age|marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry for "age of consent"&lt;/ref&gt; but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], and [[List of countries by minimum driving age|driving age]].

Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a [[misdemeanor]], such as ''corruption of a minor'', to what is popularly called ''[[statutory rape]]''.

There are many "grey areas" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between [[federal law|federal]] and [[state law|state]] laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt;

==History and social attitudes==

===Traditional attitudes===
In traditional societies, the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of [[puberty]], [[menstruation]] for a woman, and pubic hair for a man.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |title= Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society |website=faqs.org |publisher = Internet FAQ Archives |accessdate = 25 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928120836/http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |archive-date=28 September 2008 |first=Vern |last=Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]] in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (c. 700&amp;nbsp;BC) suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty, and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty.

Reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce. In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN—BOOK FOUR—TITLE I—Betrothals and Marriages—C3 |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archivedate=17 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than&amp;nbsp;seven: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of two- and three-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

The first ''recorded'' age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]] made it a misdemeanor to "ravish" a "maiden within age," whether with or without her consent. The phrase "within age" was later interpreted by jurist Sir [[Edward Coke]] (England, 17th century) as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627095601/http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |archivedate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only nine when she was married to William Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958061287|title=By birth or consent: children, law, and the Anglo-American revolution in authority.|last=Brewer|first=Holly|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=0807829501|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Edward Coke "made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a [[dower]] from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent"/&gt;

In the 16th century, a small number of Italian and German states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls, setting it at twelve years. Towards the end of the 18th century, other European countries also began to enact similar laws. The first French Constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at eleven years. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at ten to twelve years.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230|title = Children and Youth in History—Age of Consent Laws|publisher = George Mason University|accessdate = 29 June 2015|last = Robertson|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age of consent laws were, historically, difficult to follow and enforce: legal norms based on ''age'' were not, in general, common until the 19th century, because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt;

In [[Christianity|Christian]] societies, [[fornication|sex outside marriage]] was forbidden. Older children were themselves often punished for being complicit in sexual interaction with an adult.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Western Christianity also deemed that children were born into the [[original sin]], and, as such, were perceived as inherently immoral.&lt;ref name="aic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/special/007/Historical-review-sexual-offence-child-sexual-abuse.pdf|title=Historical review of sexual offence and child sexual abuse legislation in Australia: 1788–2013|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology|last1=Boxall|first1=Hayley|last2=Tomison|first2=Adam M.|last3=Hulme|first3=Shann|date=2014|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children had very few rights and were considered the [[wikt:chattel|chattel]] of the father.&lt;ref name="aic"/&gt; From the late 18th century, and especially in the 19th century, attitudes started to change. By the mid-19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="aic"/&gt;

===Reforms in the 19th and 20th century===
A general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era. Attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood. While ages from ten to thirteen years were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in [[western world|Western countries]] during the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"/&gt;

[[File:William Thomas Stead.jpg|thumb|200 px|Several articles written by investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] in the late 19th century on the issue of [[child prostitution]] in London led to public outrage and ultimately to the raising of the age of consent to sixteen.]]

English [[common law]] had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of ten to twelve years old, but the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1875]] raised this to thirteen in Great Britain and Ireland. Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.

The investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he "purchased" one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four exposés entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental "pleasure palaces". The "Maiden Tribute" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|title = Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727184445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|archivedate = 27 July 2014|last = Hogenbloom|first = Melissa|date = 1 November 2012|publisher = BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The New York Times/1895/10/15/Purity Congress Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

===21st century and present day situation===
In the 21st century, concerns about [[child sex tourism]] and [[commercial sexual exploitation]] of children gained international prominence, and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions, as well as in the adoption of several international instruments.

The [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] ([[Lanzarote]], 25 October 2007), and the [[European Union]]'s ''Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council'' of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF|title=DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted.

The [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] came into force in 2002.

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], which came into force in 2003, prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolTraffickingInPersons.aspx|title=Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|publisher=[[OHCHR]]|date=15 November 2000|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] (which came into force in 2008) also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children.

Several Western countries have raised their ages of consent recently. These include [[Ages of consent in Canada|Canada]] (in 2008—from 14 to 16); and in Europe, [[Ages of consent in Europe#Iceland|Iceland]] (in 2007—from 14 to 15), [[Ages of consent in Europe#Lithuania|Lithuania]] (in 2010—from 14 to 16), [[Ages of consent in Europe#Croatia|Croatia]] (in 2013—from 14 to 15), and [[Ages of consent in Europe#Spain|Spain]] (in 2015—from 13 to 16).

The International Criminal Court Statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape/sexual violence statute, but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons "''incapable of giving genuine consent''"; and the explicative footnote states, "It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or ''age-related incapacity''." (see note 51)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/336923D8-A6AD-40EC-AD7B-45BF9DE73D56/0/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf|title=Elements of Crimes|publisher=[[International Criminal Court]]|date=2011|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a crime in most countries, exceptions to this include, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. Jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense, including ''[[child sexual abuse]]'', ''[[statutory rape]]'', ''illegal [[carnal knowledge]]'', ''corruption of a minor'',&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt; besides others.

The enforcement practices of age-of-consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture (see above). Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g. a teacher, minister, or doctor). The [[sex]] of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual's guilt and therefore enforcement.&lt;ref name="waites" /&gt;

===Age===
The threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions ([[#Age of consent by location|see above]]). Most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent.&lt;ref name="SOA2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 9 to 12)|publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after the onset of their [[puberty]], such as [[Ages of consent in Asia#Yemen|Yemen]], but only in marriage. Ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used, such as the [[Lunar calendar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukm.my/ijwas/images/koleksi_jurnal_pdf/vol4_n1_2012a/3_Pesalah_KanakKanak_Article.pdf|title=Child offenders in Iran: Legal Analysis on the Age of Criminal Responsibility|publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|last1=Mousavi|first1=Shohreh|last2=Shapiee|first2=Rohimi|last3=Nordin|first3=Rohaida|date=30 June 2012|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193702/http://www.ukm.my/ijwas/images/koleksi_jurnal_pdf/vol4_n1_2012a/3_Pesalah_KanakKanak_Article.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; how [[February 29#Births|birth dates]] in [[leap year]]s are handled, or even the method by which birth date is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Defenses and exceptions===
The age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor's ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age, for example:
; Reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent: In some jurisdictions it is a defense if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent. However, where such a defense is provided, it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show [[due diligence]] in determining the age of the victim (e.g. an underage person who used a fake identification document claiming to be of legal age).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Larry W. Myers | title=Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed defense to Statutory Rape| journal= Michigan Law Review| volume= 64| issue=1|year=1965|pages=105–136 | doi=10.2307/1287118|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1287118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Marriage: In various jurisdictions, age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other.
; {{visible anchor|Close-in-age exemptions}}: Some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age to them. For instance, in [[Canada]], the age of consent is 16, but there are two close-in-age exemptions: sex with minors aged 14–15 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older, and sex with minors aged 12–13 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002644/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/01/crime-bill.html| archivedate= 20 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development: for instance, the age of consent in [[Finland]] is 16, but the law states that the act will not be punished if "there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039 |title=FINLEX ®—Translations of Finnish acts and decrees: 39/1889 English |publisher=Finlex.fi |date=2009-05-29 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age. For example, the age of consent in the US state of [[Delaware]] is 18, but it is allowed for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Delaware Code | title = TITLE 11, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, Delaware Criminal Code, CHAPTER 5.

; Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies: Some jurisdictions, such as [[the Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Suriname]] have a higher age of consent for [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] sexual activity. In both the United Kingdom and Western Australia, for example, the age of consent was originally 21 for same-sex sexual activity between males (with no laws regarding [[lesbian]] sexual activities), while it was 16 for [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] sexual activity; this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;''The Causes and Cures of Criminality'' Eysenck, Hans 1989 Plenum Press New York page 229&lt;/ref&gt; However, such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged.

In countries where there are gender-age differentials, the age of consent may be higher for girls—for example in [[Papua New Guinea]], where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is 16 for girls and 14 for boys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pg/LRC/WP_1.htm |title=Law, Ethics and HIV/AIDS: Existing Law of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Paclii.org |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419132305/http://www.paclii.org/pg/LRC/WP_1.htm |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be higher for males, such as in Indonesia, where males must be 19 years old and females must be 16 years old.&lt;ref name="Indonesia" /&gt; There are also numerous jurisdictions—such as Kuwait&lt;ref name="Kuwait"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=Summary record of the 488th meeting : Kuwait |publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palestinian National Authority|the Palestinian Territories]]&lt;ref name="Palestine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/palestine.htm |title=Palestinian Territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip – Marriage Age |publisher=Emory Law |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—in which [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage laws]] govern the gender-age differential. In these jurisdictions, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage, so the ''de facto'' age of consent is the marriageable age. In Kuwait, this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old.
; Position of authority/trust: In most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 (such as England and Wales),&lt;ref name=SOA2003_a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 16 to&amp;nbsp;24) |publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18, the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher. Examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students. For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes&amp;nbsp;18.

; Circumstances of the relationship: In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called "estupro" defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person.

===Extraterritoriality===
{{see also|Child sex tourism#Extraterritorial jurisdiction}}
A growing number of countries have specific [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial legislation]] that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children. In 2008, [[ECPAT]] reported that 44 countries had extraterritorial child sex legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Child Sex Tourism? - ECPAT International|url=http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/cst_faq_eng.pdf|page=35|publisher=[[ECPAT]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[PROTECT Act of 2003]], a federal United States law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with U.S. citizens from another state, if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal, state, or local law. This applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the United States, or from one state into another, for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423|title=18 U.S. Code § 2423—Transportation of minors|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOLR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solresearch.org/~SOLR/rprt/USnatlAoC.asp |title=Research on sex offender laws and their effects on people and society |year=2009 |publisher=SOL Research.org |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Gender of participants===
There is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter, in law or in practice. Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt; Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="chnm.gmu.edu"/&gt; On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an "unequal act" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs,&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA writes that "Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men."[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents]&lt;/ref&gt; and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in ''[[Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County|Michael M. v. Superior Ct.450 U.S. 464 (1981)]]'' it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because "the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html|title=Michael M. v. Superior Ct. :: 450 U.S. 464 (1981) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys (the latter acts often falling under [[sodomy]] and [[buggery]] laws). This means that in some legal systems, issues of women having sexual contact with underage partners were rarely acknowledged. For example, until 2000, in the UK, before the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]], there was no statutory age of consent for [[lesbian]] sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1045383.stm|title=BBC News—UK—Q and A: The age of consent|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], before 2005, there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys.&lt;ref&gt;"In respect of sexual conduct with a young person aged under 16, the bill [Crimes Amendment Bill (No 2) which became law in 2005 [http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL5923_1/crimes-amendment-bill-no-2] significantly toughens the law.

===Marriage and the age of consent===

The age at which a person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent. In jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent, those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of a married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent. Some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age, as in the case of [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Power |first=Carla |title=Nujood Ali &amp; Shada Nasser win "Women of the Year Fund 2008 Glamour Award" |publisher=Yemen Times |date=12 August 2009 |url=http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |accessdate=6 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405190616/http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1207&amp;p=report&amp;a=1 |archivedate=5 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Human Rights Watch| title= World Report 2001|chapter= Yemen: Human Rights Developments | publisher= Human Rights Watch | year=2001 | url= https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html | accessdate=8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214816/http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/yemen.html| archivedate=15 June 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, states, or other jurisdictions, the age of consent may be lower than the age at which a person can appear in [[pornography|pornographic]] images and films. In many jurisdictions, the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is 18. As such, in some jurisdictions, films and images showing individuals under the age of 18, but above the age of consent, that meet the legal definition of [[child pornography]] are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction's age of consent laws. In those cases, it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered a sex crime. For example, in the United States under federal law it is a crime to film minors below 18 in sexual acts, even in states where the age of consent is below 18.&lt;ref name="SOLR" /&gt; In those states, charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with a minor, who could not be otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape, provided they filmed or photographed the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brilliant |first=Jeremy |title=New Castle detective resigns over child porn charges |url=http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=10854092&amp;nav=9Tai |accessdate=25 May 2012 |newspaper=wthr.com Eyewitness News |date=August 5, 2009 |location=Henry County |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524173904/http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=10854092&amp;nav=9Tai |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned regarding their legality legal analyst [[Jeffrey Toobin]] stated he thought it was not illegal, though legal expert [[Sunny Hostin]] was more skeptical, describing jailbait images as "borderline" child pornography which may be illegal.&lt;ref name=mediaite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/anderson-cooper-excoriates-reddit-for-creepy-jailbait-section/ |title=Anderson Cooper Excoriates Reddit For 'Creepy' Jailbait Section |last1=Crugnale |first1=James |date=September 30, 2011 |work=[[Mediaite]] |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/18/us/internet-troll-apology/ |title=Man behind 'Jailbait' posts exposed, loses job |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=David |last2=Griffin |first2=Drew |date=October 19, 2012 |work=[[CNN]] |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===

The human [[immune system]] continues to develop after puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/524225_4|title=Medscape: Medscape Access|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of exposure has an influence upon if the immune system can fend off infections in general, and this is also true in the case of some [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]]. For example, a risk factor for [[HPV]] strains causing [[genital wart]]s is sexual debut at a young age;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4018629 |title=Men's beliefs about HPV-related disease|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|volume=33|issue=4|pages=274–281|year=2010|author1=Brewer|first1=N.

L.|doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9251-2|pmid=20162346}}&lt;/ref&gt; if this extends to the cancer causing strains, then sexual debut at a young age would potentially also increase risk of persistence of HPV infections that cause the very [[Human papillomavirus#Cancer|HPV induced cancers]] that are being diagnosed in spiking numbers of relatively young people.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
{{Main article|Age of consent reform}}
Age-of-consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups, for different reasons, to alter or abolish age-of-consent laws. These efforts advocate five main positions:
* Introductions of close-in-age exceptions.
* A change in the way that age-of-consent laws are examined in court.
* Either increases in the ages of consent or more severe penalties or both.
* Either decreases in the ages of consent or less severe penalties or both.
* Abolition of the age-of-consent laws either permanently or as a temporary, practical expedient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">An '''allocation questionnaire''' is a form used in [[English language|English]] [[legal practice]].  After a claim is made, if a defence is filed each party is required to complete and return an allocation questionnaire to the court so that the judge may properly allocate the claim to a track and give further directions towards a final hearing.

==Forms on the Internet==

Sample allocation questionnaires are available on the [[Internet]]. The official UK Courts web site has many forms available, including the allocation questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/claims/index.htm |title=UK Courts forms |access-date=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706220941/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/claims/index.htm |archive-date=2010-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual form is available, as of March 2007, as a [[pdf]] file.&lt;ref name="Form"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/n150_1001.pdf PDF file of the allocation questionnaire ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] provides a generic [[legal advice]] web site with information about the words and phrases used in small claims procedure in UK Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_rights/legal_system/small_claims.htm AdviceGuide.org.uk] from the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The form itself==

The allocation questionnaire is a Pivotal Point in the judicial process requesting the following information:
* Whether you wish to have a month to settle the case.
* What is the location or [[Venue (law)|venue]] of the case, and why it is chosen.
* Whether any '''pre-action protocols''' applied, and whether these were complied with.
* What is the amount of the claim in dispute.
* Who you will call as lay or [[expert witness]]es.
* Whether the case should be considered small claims, or another track.
* How long you think the trial will take.
* How much your costs will be (in Pounds sterling).&lt;ref name="Form" /&gt;

==Tracks==

There are three tracks:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part26.htm#rule26_1 CPR 26.1(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Small claims - any claim up to £10,000 and certain [[personal injury]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] claims under £1,000.
# Fast track - disputes involving between £10,000 and £25,000.
# Multi-track - disputes that are claimed to be over £25,000, or in certain cases where the claim is for less than £25,000 but the complexity of the evidence and/or legal issues to be decided means the claim is better suited to the Multi-track, particularly where a claim will take more than 1 day to try.  All Part 8 proceedings are allocated to the Multi-track.&lt;ref name="Form" /&gt;

The Woolf Report had recommended these changes in 1999 to the [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/de/privateinvestigator/woolf.html Woolf Report online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as "Awn Network" ({{lang-ar|شبكة عون}}), many people in Gaza prefer to call it  [[Legal Clinic]]s ({{lang-ar|العيادة القانونية}}), it was established by [[UNDP]]/PAPP &lt;ref&gt;UNDP Programme of Assistance to Palestinian People

}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in ِApril-2011. It’s  comprised primarily from organizations that are non-public, non-state [[civil society]] actors that are politically unaffiliated.

==The Network==
[[File:Agreement Signing Ceremony.JPG|thumb|Agreement Signing Ceremony between UNDP Palestine ([[Ibrahim Abu-shammalah]] left) and Bar Associations ([[Salama Bseiso]] right), Gaza City April 25, 2013.]]

The members of Awn Network are; the {{ill|Palestinian Bar Association|ar|شبكة عون للوصول للعدالة في قطاع غزة}}, [[human rights|human right]] organizations, community-based organizations and academic institutions, the permanent secretariat of the Awn Network is within the Palestinian Bar Association. In 2012 network members provided legal aid services (awareness, consultation and representation) to more than 23,000 people, of whom 72% were women.
Awn Net has invested heavily in coordination and cooperation within the 20 members of the network by supporting dialogue meetings (including the Legal Task Force), referral mechanisms, the case management system and the legal aid database, while continuing to provide capacity development support to individual network members and working to ensure sustainability of the network.
Awn Network has provided legal services to mainly poor and vulnerable people, to strengthen their access to [[justice]] and solve their legal problems at the lowest and simplest level possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsdl.org.ps/site/en/?p=48|title=The National Society for Democracy and Law - The idea of the causes and background of the work of Legal Aid Scheme|website=www.nsdl.org.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal services provided==

Legal services start with legal [[information]] and [[education]], giving people knowledge that they have rights under the law and how to exercise them. Such knowledge and confidence can help in solving legal problems without recourse to the courts, a cost-effective and empowering strategy. Where legal remedies are available, this can be the cheapest and simplest form of legal aid, and the one where the greatest resources should be applied.
Legal advice (explaining what the law means and how to exercise it in relation to a concrete problem) is often less costly than providing assistance – understood as helping a person to take legal steps to protect their rights.
Free judicial representation by Awn Network’s legal aid lawyers is only limited to poor individuals who can’t afford paying courts fees or lawyers’ costs.

The '''Bodleian Law Library''' ('''BLL''') is an [[academic library]] in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | chapter=Law Library | year=1988 | page=216 | isbn=0-333-39917-X | editor-last=Hibbert |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of [[Oxford University]], the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian Libraries]] and is also the library of the Faculty of Law. It is situated in part of the [[listed building|Grade II*-listed]] St Cross Building&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildingcentre.co.uk/case_study/st-cross-building-oxford|title=St Cross Building, Oxford|website=''buildingcentre.co.uk''|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[St Cross Road]] in the parish of [[Holywell, Oxford|Holywell]], on the corner of [[Manor Road, Oxford|Manor Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/about-us/about-faculty/st-cross-building|title=St Cross Building|website=Oxford Law Faculty|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The library is one of the largest open-access law libraries in Europe.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Opened in 1964, it now{{when|date=October 2014}} contains over 450,000 volumes on 16,000 linear metres of shelving, and is housed in purpose-built library accommodation designed by the distinguished architects [[Sir Leslie Martin]] and [[Colin St John Wilson]].

The BLL benefits from the Bodleian's status as a library of [[legal deposit]], by which the BLL has the right to claim a copy of any printed legal material published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Together with its position as an official Documentation Centre for the [[European Union]] and its significant expenditure on foreign legal materials, this means that the BLL adds more than 10,000 new items to its stock each year.

The BLL serves a wide and expanding range of university and external readers.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Its primary 'client' base is the [[University of Oxford]]'s Faculty of Law which, with over 1,100 undergraduate and postgraduate students and 80 academic staff, is the largest law faculty in the United Kingdom. At the same time, and because of its legal deposit status, the BLL is also used extensively by legal firms, lawyers, and individual researchers from both home and abroad. 

The BLL collection supports the teaching and research of Law at the University of Oxford, and shares Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies with the [[Social Science Library, Oxford|Social Science Library]]. The St Cross Building is adjacent to the Social Science Building in Manor Road, which houses the Social Sciences departments, including the Economics Department, as well as the Social Science Library.

==Collection==
The BLL collection has been built up over a period of four centuries, both from the legal deposit intake, and from specific purchases based on recommendations from academics and researchers alike.{{fact|date=October 2014}} The core primary legal materials for the UK, the Commonwealth countries, the US, the EU, individual European countries, and international law are collected on an ongoing basis, together with key legal texts for all jurisdictions. The BLL holds full sets of previous editions of major UK legal monographs on the open shelves.

It receives over 2,000 [[periodical publication|serial]] titles per annum, including law reports, legislation, journals and looseleaf services from all the jurisdictions held in the collection.{{fact|date=October 2014}} The BLL holds several special collections, including rare books, the Viner collection, the Bandar Collection of [[Islamic Law]], and the Kahn-Freund collection of [[labour law]] material.

Readers have access to all leading UK legal databases, together with a large number of foreign legal databases, supporting the research undertaken by members of the faculty.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Network printing, scanning and photocopying are provided.

==Facilities==
[[File:Main Reading Room, Bodleian Law Library, University of Oxford - 20081018.jpg|thumb|Main Reading Room.]]
The BLL was designed to hold the law collection of the Bodleian Library on open access shelves, ensuring ready access at all times to scholars.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Seating is provided for 430 readers, with over one third of seats reserved for postgraduate student use. 

There is a Graduate Reading Room.{{fact|date=October 2014}} This area occupies a separate wing, and provides students with [[ethernet]] access, several PCs, and wireless access for laptops.

The BLL has a total of 40 [[Personal computer|PCs]] for reader use.{{fact|date=October 2014}}{{when|date=October 2014}} The PCs in the Freshfields IT room on the lower floor and in the Gallery computer room require readers to log in, but there are a few PCs for searching the catalogue on each floor. Wireless access for laptop computers is provided throughout most areas of the library and is accessed using the same login as the library PCs.

The Baker McKenzie room is available for student use for group discussion, as well as {{linktext|carrel}} facilities which are offered on a shared basis.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

==Legal research==
The Law Library staff provide an extensive teaching programme to all postgraduate and undergraduate students. The Legal Research Skills Programme is a compulsory first year subject for undergraduates;{{fact|date=October 2014}} all postgraduates are provided with detailed library induction, as well as a wide range of research classes offered each term. Legal information guides to specific countries and to legal subjects is available in leaflet form.{{fact|date=July 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17307">The '''Budweiser trademark dispute''' is an ongoing series of legal disputes between two beer companies (from the [[Czech Republic]] and the [[United States]]) who claim trademark and geographic origin rights to the name "Budweiser". The dispute has been ongoing since 1907, and has involved more than 100 court cases around the world. As a result, [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery|Budweiser Budvar]] has the rights to the name Budweiser in most of Europe and [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] has this right in [[North America]]. Consequently, AB InBev uses the name "Bud" in most of Europe and Budvar sells its beer in North America under the name "Czechvar". In other territories, one or other or even both may use the name, depending on local trademark law.

== Background ==
Beer brewing in the city of [[České Budějovice]] ({{lang-de|Böhmisch Budweis}}), which was then in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and is now in the [[Czech Republic]], dates back to the 13th century,&lt;ref name="goodbeer"&gt;Harper, Timothy; Oliver, Garrett (1997). ''The Good Beer Book'', p.68. New York: Berkley. {{ISBN|0-425-15614-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when the city was granted [[brewing right|brewing rights]] during the reign of [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]]. During the time when both [[Czech language|Czech]] and German were official languages in the kingdom, two breweries were founded in the city. Both breweries made beer which they called "Budweiser", similar to how brewers in the city of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] made a beer generically called [[Pilsner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Patent Dispute Could Put Czech Brewer in A-B InBev’s M&amp;A Crosshairs|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/07/16/patent-dispute-could-put-czech-brewer-in-a-b-inbevs-ma-crosshairs/|website = WSJ Blogs - Deal Journal|date = 2008-07-16|accessdate = 2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer from Budweis began exporting to the United States in 1872–73 and then again since 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budějovičtí právovárečníci – Měšťanský pivovar České Budějovice, založen 1795|url=http://encyklopedie.c-budejovice.cz/clanek/mestansky-pivovar|website=Encyklopedie Českých Budějovic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, the American brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] began making a beer which they also called "Budweiser", motivated in part by a desire to "brew a beer similar in quality, color, flavor and taste to the beer then made at Budweis", according to [[Adolphus Busch]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Parties==
Two breweries currently claim rights to the word "Budweiser":
* [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] has marketed "[[Budweiser]]" in the United States and Canada since 1876, and won a series of trademark confrontations to consolidate control of the Budweiser mark in the United States in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ogle |first=Maureen |date=2007-10-08 |title=Ambitious Brew: The Story of American Beer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-s6Zo7sXzwC&amp;pg=PA109 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |page=109 |isbn=0547536917}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, AB InBev had 150,000 employees globally and sold 400 million hectoliters of beer annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cunningham |first=Benjamin |date=27 January 2014 |title=Where a Budweiser Isn’t Allowed to Be a Budweiser |url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/27/where-a-budweiser-isnt-allowed-to-be-a-budweiser/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery]] ({{lang-cs|Budějovický Budvar, národní podnik}}) is a [[state-owned]] brewery founded in 1895 by Czech-speaking citizens of Budweis and directly continued the tradition of beer brewing in Budweis, which dates back to the 13th century. As of 2014, it employed 600 people, sold 1.4 million hectoliters of beer annually and exported into 66 foreign countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In addition, [[Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu]] ({{lang-cs|Budějovický měšťanský pivovar}}) was founded in 1795 by German-speaking citizens of Budweis, and began exporting beer under the "Budweiser Bier" name to the United States in 1875.

Anheuser-Busch cites prior registration of the trademark in the United States, and more recently its ownership of Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu, when making a claim to the mark. Anheuser-Busch has also pointed to advertising campaigns where those predated any formal registration by either party, such as an extensive campaign in the 1930s in Italy that predated Budvar's 1940 registrations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rJJOgarIGOcC|title=Landmark Intellectual Property Cases and Their Legacy: IEEM International Intellectual Property Conferences|last=Heath|first=Christopher|last2=Sanders|first2=Anselm Kamperman|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041133434|language=en|chapter=Chapter 10: The Budweiser Cases: A Brewing Conflict|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rJJOgarIGOcC&amp;pg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budweis-based companies have argued in turn that Budweiser is [[Generic trademark|generic]], or is a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical indication]] that refers to beer made specifically in the city of Budweis. Where possible, Budvar's claims are supported by proof of prior use (as in Germany).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Contracts between Anheuser-Busch and the two Czech breweries in 1911 and 1939 have also factored into some of the cases. These contracts allegedly gave Anheuser the right to use Budweiser as a "trade name or trade mark" while giving the European companies the right to use Budweiser "as descriptive of geographical origin".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the European Union, the cases have led to several court rulings about the nature and scope of protected geographical indications (also known as "appellations of origin"). In Italy, courts found that an appellation could be valid even if the place to which the case referred no longer exists (in this case, the city of Budweis, now [[České Budějovice|Budějovice]]), which gave Budvar's brand protection in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lazzarino |first=Paolo |date=30 September 2013 |title=Italian Supreme Court: is Budweiser an appellation of origin? |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=30968d3e-394b-49e1-93d0-8387d40266f5 |publisher=Lexology |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case originating in Austria, the European Court of Justice ruled that simple indications (in this case "Bud") could not be prohibited if a more specific appellation was protected, therefore allowing AB InBev to sell "Bud" in Austria, but not "Budweiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hauer |first=Christian |date=10 September 2012 |title=The Austrian “Budweiser” dispute: protecting appellations of origin under Regulation (EC) 510/2006 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=43201557-9164-433c-8101-e231e015898f |publisher=Lexology |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the dispute ==
In 1907, American and Bohemian brewers made an agreement that Anheuser-Busch could market its beer as Budweiser only in North America, while the Bohemian brewers had the rights to the European markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Duprey |first=Rich |date=3 July 2014 |title=Anheuser-Busch InBev Stakes Claim to Budweiser Name |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/03/anheuser-busch-inbev-stakes-claim-to-budweiser-nam.aspx |publisher=The Motley Fool |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, litigation has been extensive: according to the Budvar website, as of 2012 there were "about 40 trademark dispute cases pending in different jurisdictions and some 70 procedural issues up for consideration around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budweiserbudvar.co.uk/history/budweiser/|title=The Trademark|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Budweiser Budvar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218105941/http://www.budweiserbudvar.co.uk/history/budweiser/|archive-date=2013-02-18|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of January 2013, Budvar claimed to have won 89 of 124 cases against AB InBev, with an additional eight ending in a draw or settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Petr |first=Miroslav |date=15 January 2013 |title=Lordi potvrdili práva Budvaru v Británii.

In the European Union (EU), Budějovický Budvar is recognized as a product with [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Geographical Indication]]. However, the trademark rights to the name Budweiser for some products other than beer are owned by Anheuser-Busch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=EU Court Upholds Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser Trademarks |url=https://www.dw.com/en/eu-court-upholds-anheuser-buschs-budweiser-trademarks/a-2606482 |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=23 April 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, Anheuser-Busch and Budvar reached an agreement that stated that Anheuser-Busch would market Budvar/Czechvar in the United States and several other countries for an undisclosed fee. However, both sides stated that this did not affect their lawsuits. The partnership with [[AB InBev]] was terminated in January 2012, and in July of that year, United States Beverage began responsibility for the sales and marketing of Czechvar in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesbeverage.com/news-details.php?ID=220|title=United States Beverage Named New U.S. Importer for Czechvar Beer|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Anheuser-Busch lost an appeal against the EU's [[Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market]] (OHIM) decision to reject the registration of ''Budweiser'' as an EU-wide trademark for beer for Anheuser-Busch. The court pointed out that Budějovický Budvar had proven that it had been using the trade mark during at least the five years preceding the publication of Anheuser-Busch's application for a Community trade mark. The decision also covers malted non-alcoholic beverages (such as non-alcoholic beer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-03/cp090025en.pdf |title=Court of First Instance of the European Communities &amp;#124; Press Release No° 25/09 &amp;#124; Judgment of the Court in Case T-191/07 Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v OHIM &amp;#124; 25&amp;nbsp;March 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}
'''Cabinet collective responsibility''', also known as '''collective ministerial responsibility''',&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Oonagh; Powell, Thomas. [http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP04-82/RP04-82.pdf Research Paper 04/82: "The collective responsibility of Ministers – an outline of the issues"], ''Parliament and Constitution Centre, the House of Commons Library''. 15 November 2004. p. 7: "As with so much of the United Kingdom constitutional and political system, collective ministerial responsibility is not something created or explained in some statute or constitutional document."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in [[Parliamentary system|Parliamentary systems]] that members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] must publicly support all governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree with them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature. Some Communist political parties apply a similar convention of [[democratic centralism]] to their [[central committee]].

If a member of the Cabinet wishes to openly object to a Cabinet decision then they are obliged to resign from their position in the Cabinet.

Cabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that if a [[vote of no confidence]] is passed in [[parliament]], the government is responsible collectively, and thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new government will be formed or parliament will be dissolved and a [[general election]] will be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as [[individual ministerial responsibility]], which states that [[Minister (government)|ministers]] are responsible for the running of their departments, and therefore culpable for the departments' mistakes.

==Overview==
Cabinet collective responsibility is a tradition in parliamentary governments in which the [[prime minister]] is responsible for appointing the cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers are usually selected from the same [[political party]] as the prime minister to make collective decision-making for [[legislation]] faster and more effective. Unlike a presidential system, as used, for example, in the United States, a parliamentary system’s [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislative branch|legislative]] branches are intertwined. Because of the [[fusion of powers]] of the executive and legislative branches the prime minister relies on the cabinet to always support their policy decisions.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary Democracy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Leroy Way|title=British and American Constitutional Democracy|url=http://www.proconservative.net/CUNAPolSci201PartThreeA.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of cabinet collective responsibility, such as when a cabinet member publicly disagrees with an executive decision results in a resignation or termination from that cabinet position.&lt;ref name="Australian Gov." /&gt; The New South Wales Parliamentary Library Research Service in Australia explains that "one aspect of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers share responsibility for major government decisions, particularly those made by the cabinet and, even if they personally object to such decisions, Ministers must be prepared to accept and defend them or resign from the cabinet".&lt;ref name="Australian Gov."&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Gareth|title=Minority governments in Australia 1989-2009 : accords, charters and agreements |year=2010|publisher=NSW Parliamentary Library Research Service|location=[Sydney, N.S.W.]|isbn=978-0-7313-1860-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet collective responsibility consists of two main features:
;{{anchor|Cabinet confidentiality}}&lt;!-- [[Cabinet confidentiality]] redirects here--&gt;Cabinet confidentiality:the members of the cabinet must not reveal the content of the discussion which takes place. This allows for cabinet members to privately debate and raise concerns.
;Cabinet solidarity:the members of the cabinet must publicly show a unified position, and must vote with the government even if they privately disagree with the decision that has been made.

Collective responsibility is not circumvented by appointing Ministers outside of Cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Office ''Cabinet Manual 2008'' (Wellington, 2008) para 3.20&lt;/ref&gt; as has occurred in [[New Zealand]] where, from 2005 to 2008, [[Winston Peters]] and [[Peter Dunne]] were Ministers outside of Cabinet, despite their parties not being considered part of a coalition.

In non-parliamentary governments like that of the United States, cabinet collective responsibility is not formally practiced. This is due to the clear separation of the executive and the legislature in policy-making. The United States president's [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] members cannot simultaneously serve in [[United States Congress|Congress]], and therefore cannot vote on legislation supported by the executive. The president instead has [[veto]] power over legislation passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Congress Report"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Eric |title=Congress: A brief comparison of the British House of Commons and the U.S. House of Representatives |journal=Congressional Research Service |date=19 May 2005 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabinet unity and collective agreement between members are important to cabinet stability and party politics, but cabinet members do not have to publicly support legislation proposed or supported by the president. It is, however, in the cabinet member's best interest to support and align with the president's policies, because they serve at the pleasure of the president, who can at any time dismiss them or appoint them to another position.

==Examples==
Parliamentary democracies such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada practice and adhere to cabinet collective responsibility. Rhodes, Wanna and Weller offer this description of the principle of cabinet solidarity in [[Westminster system]]s of parliamentary democracy: "Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility are twin dimensions of responsible party government that enjoy [[constitutionality]], albeit informally. They lie at the core of ministerial governance. Cabinet solidarity is purely a political convention designed to maintain or protect the collective good as perceived by a partisan ministry. It rests on the notion that the executive ought to appear a collective entity, able to maintain cohesion and display political strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparing Westminster |first1=R.A.W. |last1=Rhodes |first2=John |last2=Wanna |first3=Patrick |last3=Weller |publisher=OUP |location= |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-956349-4 |page=127 |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia, cabinet collective responsibility is fundamental to cabinet confidentiality, but also to protect private information from becoming public and possibly threatening [[national security]]. Cabinet solidarity is not a legal requirement, but a political convention and practiced norm. There is no written law that upholds cabinet collective responsibility, but it is deeply ingrained in Australia's cabinets as a political norm and is therefore an important aspect of the collective strength and influence of the prime minister's administration.

Occasionally on highly controversial issues such as the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|1999 republic referendum]], there may be a [[conscience vote]] where any MP may vote as they wish, but these issues are rare and never tied to official party policy, and normally party discipline is very tight.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the cabinet is on rare occasion allowed to freely vote its conscience and to oppose the government without consequence, as occurred with the vote on [[capital punishment]] under [[Brian Mulroney]]. These events are rare and are never on matters of [[Confidence and supply|confidence]]. The most prominent Canadian cabinet minister to resign because he could not vote with the cabinet was [[John Turner]], who refused to support [[wage and price controls]]. In Canada, [[party discipline]] is much tighter than in other Westminster-system countries; it is very rare for any MP to vote counter to the party leadership.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], collective responsibility has been established both constitutionally and as a convention. The [[Finnish Government]] and its ministers are collectively responsible for all its decisions. However, the constitution allows a minister to dissent by expressing an objection which is entered into the minutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fi/books?id=xY3fNI0oLLsC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=Cabinet+%22collective+responsibility%22+finland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxxS8dZVz9&amp;sig=F-PeAirKh-S5hnmRFYV-L9TknOU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmxs2G8bzcAhWkKJoKHVbqAaoQ6AEIfTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabinet%20%22collective%20responsibility%22%20finland&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while formally allowed, dissent is uncommon because it jeopardizes the stability of the government. Namely, majority [[coalition government]]s became the norm after President [[Urho Kekkonen|Kekkonen]] retired in 1981. A new cabinet must be approved by a parliamentary majority, thus a [[government platform]] is agreed upon by the participating parties. It is distinct from party platforms and details the compromises that parties made in order to cooperate. If a party fails to follow the government platform, other parties in the government can pull the plug and force the entire government to resign.

===Ireland===
Article 28.4.2° of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article28_4_2|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=28.4.2°|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Government of Ireland|The Government]] shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the [[Department of State (Ireland)|Departments of State]] administered by the members of the Government.
In 1992, the [[Beef Tribunal]] was investigating allegations of political corruption, and wanted to take evidence from a minister about cabinet meetings at which controversial proposals had been discussed. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1993 that such discussions could not be disclosed because Article 28.4.2° required absolute confidentiality of cabinet discussions (though not of decisions which were formally recorded).&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Hamilton (No 1)'' [1993] 2 IR 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution]] was passed by referendum in 1997 to add Article 28.4.3°, which allows such disclosures in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/ca/17/enacted/en/html|title=Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1997.|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forde|first1=Michael|last2=Leonard|first2=David|title=Constitutional Law of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVsQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2016|year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667380|pages=129–130  |chapter=6.10 Cabinet confidentiality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom practices cabinet collective responsibility. The prime minister selects a number of cabinet ministers from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]]. Once selected as cabinet ministers, each minister is given a position as head of one of the government departments. Cabinet ministers respond to oral questions from [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MPs]]. The cabinet members, along with the Prime Minister, schedule weekly closed door sessions to discuss the collective stance of the cabinet to avoid inconsistent responses from cabinet ministers. The solidarity of the cabinet is consistently challenged by the opposition in an attempt to create contradictions between cabinet ministers. It is therefore imperative for the cabinet members to have their responses as common and similar as possible.&lt;ref name="Congress Report" /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the doctrine applies to all members of the government, from members of the cabinet down to [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Parliamentary Private Secretaries]]. Its inner workings are set out in the [[Ministerial Code (United Kingdom)|Ministerial Code]]. On occasion, this principle has been suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] allowed its [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] members to oppose the introduction of [[protectionism|protective tariffs]]; and again when [[Harold Wilson]] allowed Cabinet members to campaign both for and against the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 referendum]] on whether the UK should remain in the [[European Economic Community]]. In 2003, [[Tony Blair]] allowed [[Clare Short]] to stay in the cabinet, despite her public opposition to the [[2003 Iraq War]]. However, she later resigned.

The convention appeared to have been partially suspended under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] - [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]] of Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], with Liberal Democrat ministers such as [[Vince Cable]] frequently publicly criticising the actions of Conservative Cabinet members.

David Cameron suspended the cabinet collective responsibility doctrine for the EU Referendum held on 23 June, 2016, following the precedent set by Harold Wilson on this matter in 1975.

A parliamentary system that uses cabinet collective responsibility is more likely to avoid contradictions and disagreements between cabinet members of the executive branch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cabinet ministers are likely to feel there is a practical and collective benefit from being part of a team.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cabinet collective responsibility to the people also benefits party and personal loyalty to the prime minister. Solidarity within the cabinet can strengthen the prime minister's party and accelerate policy decisions and interests of that party. Presidential democracies often lack the ability to pass legislation quickly in times of emergency or instances of [[national security]].&lt;ref name="British Gov in Crisis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Christopher|title=British government in crisis : or the third English revolution|year=2005|publisher=Hart |location=Oxford|isbn=1-84113-549-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Because cabinet collective responsibility forces the cabinet ministers to publicly agree with the prime minister's decisions, political debate and internal discourse is hindered. When disagreements occur within a cabinet dependent on collective responsibility, negotiating collective agreements can be difficult. Cabinet collective responsibility is therefore dependent on the mutual agreement and collective unity of the cabinet and its members.

'''Charter 77''' (''Charta 77'' in [[Czech language|Czech]] and in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) was an informal civic initiative in [[communist Czechoslovakia]] from 1976 to 1992, named after the document Charter 77 from January 1977. Founding members and architects were [[Jiří Němec (philosopher)|Jiří Němec]], [[Václav Benda]], [[Ladislav Hejdánek]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Jan Patočka]], [[Zdeněk Mlynář]], [[Jiří Hájek]], [[Martin Palouš]], [[Pavel Kohout]] and [[Ladislav Lis]]. Spreading the text of the document was considered a [[political crime]] by the communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.praguecoldwar.cz/rozborcharta.htm |title=Stanovisko generálního prokurátora ČSSR, předsedy Nejvyššího soudu ČSSR, ministra spravedlnosti ČSR a generálního prokurátora ČSR k 'Prohlášení Charty 77' |trans-title=Opinion of the Attorney General of Czechoslovakia, President of the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia to the 'Declaration of Charter 77' |language=Czech |first=Petr |last=Blažek |journal=PWSV |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], many of its members played important roles in Czech and Slovak politics.

==Founding and political aims==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
Motivated in part by the arrest of members of the psychedelic band [[Plastic People of the Universe]], the text of Charter 77 was prepared in 1976.  In December 1976, the first signatures were collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalita.cz/vysvetlivky/ch77.php Totalita.cz: Charta 77]&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was published on 6 January 1977, along with the names of the first 242 signatories, which represented various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. Although [[Václav Havel]], [[Ludvík Vaculík]] and [[Pavel Landovský]] were [[detention of suspects|detained]] while trying to bring the charter to the [[Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia|Federal Assembly]] and the [[Government structure of Communist Czechoslovakia#Executive Branch|Czechoslovak government]], and the original document was [[confiscated]],&lt;ref name=cuni&gt;[http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/ Podpisy Prohlášení Charty 77 (1977–1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114002852/http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/ |date=2007-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; copies circulated as [[samizdat]] and on 7 January were published in several western newspapers (including [[Le Monde]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[The Times]] and [[The New York Times]]) and transmitted to Czechoslovakia by Czechoslovak-banned [[radio broadcaster]]s like [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Voice of America]].

Charter 77 criticized the government for failing to implement [[human rights]] provisions of a number of documents it had signed, including the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], the Final Act of the 1975 [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (Basket III of the [[Helsinki Accords]]), and 1966 [[United Nations]] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|covenants on political, civil]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|economic, and cultural rights]].&lt;ref name=skilling&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin| isbn = 0043210260| last = Skilling| first = H. Gordon| title = Charter 77 and human rights in Czechoslovakia| location = London ; Boston| year = 1981}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209–212}} The document also described the signatories as a "loose, informal, and open association of people . . . united by the will to strive individually and collectively for respect for human and civil rights in our country and throughout the world." It emphasized that Charter 77 is not an organization, has no statutes or permanent organs, and "does not form the basis for any oppositional political activity." This final stipulation was a careful effort to stay within the bounds of [[Czechoslovak law]], which made organized opposition illegal.

Many of the organization's activists and members gathered on 29 March 2007 at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in Richmond, London, to observe the movement's 30th anniversary and to discuss the historical impact their movement generated in modern European politics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Reaction of the government==
The government's reaction to the appearance of Charter 77 was harsh. The official press described the manifesto as "an anti-state, anti-socialist, and demagogic, abusive piece of writing," {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and individual signatories were variously described as "traitors and renegades,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "a loyal servant and agent of imperialism,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "a bankrupt politician,"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and "an international adventurer."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} As it was considered to be an illegal document, the full text of Charter 77 was never published in the official press. However an official group of artists and writers was mobilized into an "anti-charter" movement which included Czechoslovakia's foremost singer [[Karel Gott]] as well as prominent comedic writer [[Jan Werich]] who later claimed he had no idea of what he was doing whilst signing the anti-charter. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Several means of retaliation were used against the signatories, including [[dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] from work, denial of [[right to education|educational opportunities]] for their children, suspension of drivers' licenses, forced exile, loss of citizenship, and detention, trial, and imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Many members were forced to collaborate with the communist secret service (the StB, Czech: [[StB|Státní bezpečnost]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The treatment of Charter 77 signatories prompted the creation in April 1978 of a support group, the [[Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted]] (''Výbor na obranu nespravedlivě stíhaných'' – VONS), to publicize the fate of those associated with the charter. In October 1979 six leaders of this support group, including Václav Havel, were tried for subversion and sentenced to prison terms of up to five years.

Repression of Charter 77 and VONS members continued during the 1980s. Despite unrelenting harassment and arrests, however, the groups continued to issue reports on the government's violations of human rights. Until the Velvet Revolution, Charter 77 had approximately 1,900 signatories.&lt;ref name=cuni/&gt;

==Influence==
Under the dictatorship, the influence of Charter 77 remained limited and only 1,065 people ever signed the document.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 9780385497992| last = Hitchcock| first = William | authorlink = William I. Hitchcock| title = The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent, 1945 to the Present| location = New York| year = 2003 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; It didn't reach wide groups of people and most of its members were from Prague. The majority of Czechoslovak citizens knew of the organization only because of the government's campaign against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tajné služby USA sledovaly zrod Charty 77, její vliv na veřejnost (Secret services of USA observed the emergence of Charta 77 and its influence on public)|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/tajne-sluzby-usa-sledovaly-zrod-charty-77-jeji-vliv-na-verejnost/1425919|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=České noviny|agency=ČTK|date=11 December 2016|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, as the [[Eastern Bloc]] regimes weakened, members of Charter 77 saw their opportunity and became more involved in organizing opposition against the regime in power. During the days of the [[Velvet Revolution]], members of the group negotiated the smooth transfer of political power from dictatorship to democracy. Many were elevated into high positions in the government (e.g. Václav Havel became the President of Czechoslovakia) but since most had no experience in active politics (such as skills in diplomacy or knowledge of [[capitalism]]) they met with mixed success. &lt;!--can someone elaborate on that statement?--&gt;

Charter 77 included people who had a wide range of opinions and, after reaching their common goal, the group's presence faded. An attempt to make the group the focal point of an all-encompassing political party (the [[Civic Forum]]) failed and in 1992 the organization was officially dissolved.

[[Image:Albert Anker - Die Ziviltrauung (1887).jpg|thumb|A civil marriage in 19th century [[Switzerland]] ([[Albert Anker]], 1887)]]
A '''civil marriage''' is a [[marriage]] performed, recorded and recognised by a government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/marriagelaws/g/civilmarriage.htm |title=Civil Marriage Definition |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a marriage may be performed by a [[religion|religious]] body and recognised by the state, or it may be entirely [[secular]].

Certain countries, such as Israel, allow couples to register only on the condition that they have first been married in a religious ceremony recognised by the state, or were married in a different country.

==History==
Every country maintaining a [[Civil registry|population registry]] of its residents keeps track of [[marital status]],&lt;ref&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/mar/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and all UN Member countries except [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] have signed or ratified either the United Nations [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages]] (1962)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/MinimumAgeForMarriage.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; or the United Nations [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979) which carry a responsibility to register marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wunrn.com/news/2008/08_08/08_04_08/080408_child.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201715/http://www.wunrn.com/news/2008/08_08/08_04_08/080408_child.htm |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries define the conditions of civil marriage separately from religious requirements. Certain countries, such as Israel, allow couples to register only on the condition that they have first been married in a religious ceremony recognised by the state, or were married in a different country.

===In England===
In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], marriage was governed by [[canon law]], which recognised as valid only those marriages where the parties stated they took one another as husband and wife, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses. It was not necessary, however, to be married by any official or cleric. This institution was cancelled in England with the enactment of "[[Marriage Act 1753|Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act]]" of 1753, which required that, in order to be valid and registered, all marriages were to be performed in an official ceremony in a religious setting recognised by the state, i.e. [[Church of England]], [[Religious Society of Friends|the Quakers]], or in a [[Jewish|Jewish ceremony]]. Any other form of marriage was abolished. Children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically [[Inheritance|inherit]] the property or titles of their parents. For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland. Consequently, until 1940, it continued to be enough in Scotland for a man and a woman to pledge their commitment to each other in front of witnesses to legalise their marriage. This led to an industry of "fast marriages" in Scottish towns on the border with England; the town of [[Gretna Green]] was particularly well known for this. In [[Marriage Act 1836|1836]], the requirement that the ceremony take place in a religious forum was removed, and [[Register office|registrar]]s were given the authority to register marriages not conducted by a religious official.

===In other European countries===
[[File:A cauple wait for wedding.jpg|thumb|A couple waiting to get married in the town of [[Alghero]] on the island of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]]]
Many European countries had institutions similar to [[common-law marriage]].  In 1566, the edict of the [[Council of Trent]] was proclaimed denying [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] any form of marriage not executed in a religious ceremony before a priest and two witnesses.

The [[Protestant]] pastor and theologian of [[Geneva]], [[John Calvin]], decreed that in order for a couple to be considered married they must be registered by the state in addition to a church ceremony. 

In 1792, with the [[French Revolution]], religious marriage ceremonies in France were made secondary to civil marriage.  Religious ceremonies could still be performed, but only for couples who had already been married in a civil ceremony. [[Napoleon]] later spread this custom throughout most of Europe. In present-day France, only civil marriage has legal validity. A religious ceremony may be performed after or before the civil union, but it has no legal effect.

In Germany, the [[Napoleonic code]] was valid only in territories conquered by Napoleon. With the fall of his empire, civil marriage in Germany began to die out. However, certain sovereign German states introduced civil marriages, which were either obligatory (like the French model) or optional, with either a religious or civil ceremony being accepted. Already before 1848 the Grand-Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] enacted optional civil marriages, followed by the German republics of the [[Free City of Frankfurt|Free City of Frankfurt upon Main]] (1850, obligatory), [[Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg]] (1851, optional) and [[Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck]] (1852, optional). German Grand-Duchies such as [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] (1852/55, optional), [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] (1860) and [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]] (1860) as well as the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] (1863) followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Schoeps, "Emanzipation der Herzen – oder: Der Fall Ferdinand Falkson", in: ''PreußenJahrBuch: Ein Alamanch'' [published on the occasion of the Projekt Preussen 2001], Museumspädagogischer Dienst Berlin (MD Berlin) in collaboration with the Landesverband der Museen zu Berlin and Museumsverband des Landes Brandenburg (ed.), Berlin: MD Berlin, 2000, pp. 52–56, here p. 56. {{ISBN|3-930929-12-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil marriages enabled [[interfaith marriage]]s as well as marriages between spouses of different Christian denominations.  After the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871, the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] adopted a bill initiated by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the "Civil Marriage Law" in 1875 (see: [[Kulturkampf]]); since then, only civil marriages have been recognised in Germany.  Religious ceremonies may still be performed at the couple's discretion.  Until Dec. 31, 2008, religious marriages could not be performed until the couple had first married in a civil ceremony.

==Civil marriage in the world currently==

===England and Wales===

Today marriages in England or Wales must be held in authorised premises, which may include register offices, premises such as stately homes, castles and hotels that have been approved by the local authority, churches or chapels of the Church of England or Church in Wales, and other churches and religious premises that have been registered by the registrar general for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.weddingguideuk.com/articles/legal/englandwales.asp | publisher = Wedding Guide UK | type = article | title = Legal | contribution = England and Wales | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130209043344/http://www.weddingguideuk.com/articles/legal/englandwales.asp | archivedate = 2013-02-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil marriages require a certificate, and at times a licence, that testify that the couple is fit for marriage.  A short time after they are approved in the superintendent registrar's office, a short non-religious ceremony takes place which the registrar, the couple and two witnesses must attend; guests may also be present. Reference must not be made to God or any deity, or to a particular religion or denomination: this is strictly enforced, and readings and music in the ceremony must be agreed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://celebratewithmusic.co.uk/songs-you-cant-have-at-a-civil-ceremony/ | publisher = Wedding Music Designer (Simon Jordan) | type = article | title = Music Not Allowed at Civil Ceremonies | contribution = England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Marriage in the United States]] is still largely regulated by state laws (though not without occasional federal override—see '''[[Loving v. Virginia|Loving]]''' and   '''[[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell]]''').

All states (and the District of Columbia) require a marriage license issued by local civil authorities. As a rule, ministers of religion (e.g. rabbis or Christian pastors) are authorized in law to perform marriages; various state or local officials, such as a mayor, judge, [[deputy marriage commissioner]], or justice of the peace, are also empowered to conduct civil wedding ceremonies, which may take place in public offices. Many counties in Pennsylvania allow [[self-uniting marriage]]s for which no official minister is required, as a concession to the state's [[Quaker]] heritage (though other religious traditions also avail themselves of the option). The type of ceremony (religious or civil) has no bearing on the legal validity of the marriage, and there is no requirement to precede a religious rite with a civil ceremony. Marriages performed outside of the United States are legally binding if officially recognized by the government of the country in which they are performed.

===Countries with mandatory civil marriage===
In most [[Europe]]an countries there is a civil ceremony requirement.  Following the civil marriage ceremony, couples are free to marry in a religious ceremony.  Such ceremonies, however, only serve to provide a religious recognition of the marriage, since the state's recognition has already been given. In some of these countries (e.g. [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]]) most couples marry
without any religious ceremony at all. Full, formal weddings, complete with wedding gowns and the presence of family and friends, are usually conducted in special ceremonial rooms in the town hall.

===Countries with no civil marriage===
There is no civil marriage in many [[Middle Eastern]] countries like [[Egypt]], [[Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html | title = Marriage in Jordan | publisher = Jordan embassy | place = USA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html | archivedate = 2011-10-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[Yemen]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], as well as in [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]], among others; all marriages are conducted by religious authorities, and are registered by civil authorities only after having been registered by authorities of officially approved religions, or, having been registered abroad. Some of those countries as Israel, [[Religion_in_Syria|Syria]] and [[Demographics_of_Lebanon#18_recognized_religious_groups|Lebanon officially recognize]] Islam, Christianity, Druze, Judaism, and marriage is possible but usually only within the same community. Contrary to the situation in Lebanon, Syrian law prohibits the recognition of any marriage that falls outside the existing proscriptions of its personal status laws, even if the couple gets married abroad &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hassan |first1=Ali Wadea' |title=Between Church and State: Civil Marriage in the Arab World |url=https://raseef22.com/en/life/2017/05/07/church-state-civil-marriage-arab-world/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Egypt recognizes civil marriages but is very complicated. One will need to have all the necessary paperwork completed and then one must go with two men as your witnesses. Foreigners will need a paper from their embassy. This yields particular problems for those who are refused divorce by their spouses, or couples in religious traditions that forbid divorce altogether. [[Malaysia]] allows civil marriage for non-Muslims only, while in [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://kabul.usembassy.gov/marriage.html | title = Marriage in Afghanistan | publisher = Kabul embassy | place = USA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110906135737/http://kabul.usembassy.gov/marriage.html | archivedate = 2011-09-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is allowed for foreign citizens only.

[[Northern Ireland]] recognises same-sex civil partnerships but not same-sex marriages, and treats foreign same-sex marriages (including those from the rest of the UK) as civil partnerships.

In 22 countries worldwide and in several jurisdictions within [[Mexico]], a same-sex couple can be legally partnered in a [[civil union]], [[domestic partnership]] or [[registered partnership]]. Couples in these unions or partnerships are afforded rights and obligations similar to, but not identical to, those of a married couple.

'''Classical liberalism''' is a [[political ideology]] and a [[History of liberalism|branch]] of [[liberalism]] which advocates [[civil liberties]] under the [[rule of law]] with an emphasis on [[economic freedom]]. Closely related to [[economic liberalism]], it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to [[urbanization]] and to the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Conway|p=296}}&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book|first = Richard |last =Hudelson |date = 1999|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title= Modern Political Philosophy|pages =  37–38|isbn =9780765600219|publisher = M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=129}} Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"&gt;Steven M. Dworetz (1994). ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. It drew on the [[Classical economics|classical economic ideas]] espoused by [[Adam Smith]] in Book One of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and on a belief in [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joyce Appleby|first = Joyce|last = Appleby|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=83HlqTJjLcgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date = 1992|title = Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination|page = 58|publisher =Harvard University Press|isbn = 9780674530133}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Gerald F.|last1= Gaus |author2-link= Chandran Kukathas|first2 = Chandran|last2= Kukathas|date = 2004|title = Handbook of Political Theory |page = 422|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dXjXKlb79cgC&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = SAGE|isbn =  9780761967873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social progress|progress]].{{sfn|Hunt|p=54}} The term "classical liberalism" was applied in retrospect to distinguish earlier 19th-century liberalism from the newer [[social liberalism]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=52}}

== Evolution of core beliefs ==
Core beliefs of classical liberals included new ideas—which departed from both the older [[Conservatism|conservative]] idea of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|society as a family]] and from the later [[Sociology|sociological]] concept of society as [[Gesellschaft#Gesellschaft|complex set]] of [[social network]]s. Classical liberals believe that individuals are "egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44–46}}

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49–51}}

Drawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Alan Ryan, "Liberalism", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. ed. (2001): ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'', London: Routledge, 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; while accepting [[Economic liberalism|corporations' rights]], which led to [[inequality of bargaining power]].{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=132}}&lt;ref name = smith&gt;{{cite book|last =Smith|first = A. |date = 1778|title =  An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|volume = I|chapter = 8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lgx2t0b3Xu&amp;sig=ygsWFIUuw8JhsxYeiXgaiE5LdNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGFIUfzqNe-N4gTvqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22&amp;f=false|publisher = W. Strahan; and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals argued that individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers while the [[profit motive]] would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46–47}}

Classical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:
* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.
* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}
* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.
* Building and maintaining public institutions.
* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}

They asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.&lt;ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley&gt;[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36–38}}

Core beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because "there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law".&lt;ref name="RyanA_1995"&gt;Ryan, A. (1995): "Liberalism", In: Goodin, R. E. and Pettit, P., eds.: ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that in a pure democracy a "common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party".&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (22 November 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 p. 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [[individual freedom]]. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="mayne"&gt;Mayne, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref name="mayne"/&gt;

=== Friedrich Hayek's typology of beliefs ===
[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the "British tradition" and the "French tradition". Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the "British tradition" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the "French tradition".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|first = F. A. |last = Hayek|title = The Constitution of Liberty|location = London|publisher =  Routledge |date= 1976|pages =  55–56|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0otEBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Constitution+of+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_a-MwpreAhUQXKwKHaLkCBMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9781317857808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, 'Individualism: True and False', in ''Individualism and Economic Order'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume and Smith.

[[Guido De Ruggiero]] also identified differences between "Montesquieu and Rousseau, the English and the democratic types of liberalism"{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=71}} and argued that there was a "profound contrast between the two Liberal systems".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} He claimed that the spirit of "authentic English Liberalism" had "built up its work piece by piece without ever destroying what had once been built, but basing upon it every new departure". This liberalism had  "insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs" and "instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the "new Liberalism of France" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a "rationalistic consciousness".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81–82}}

In 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called "Anglican and Gallican Liberty". Lieber asserted that "independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty "is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382–383}}

== History ==
=== Great Britain ===
Classical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}

From the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29–30}}

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26–27}}

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}

The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves "true liberals", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised "limited government" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's "life, liberty and property" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"/&gt; As the United States grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and during the term of its first [[Populism|populist]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian era]] were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M. Brown|title=Explaining the Reagan Years in Central America: A World System Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9N1duU9zgMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-9813-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom was maximised when the government took a "hands off" attitude toward the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kahan|title=The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17397-4|page=28|quote=Called the "Jacksonian Era," this era was characterized by greater voting rights for white men, a hands-off approach to economic issues, and a desire to spread U.S. culture and government west (an outlook called "[[Manifest Destiny]]").}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues:
:[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers.

Leading magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' espoused liberalism every week starting in 1865 under the influential editor [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] (1831–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gustav |last = Pollak|url = https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofamer00poll |title= Fifty Years of American Idealism: 1865-1915|date = 1915|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], "[[Cross of Gold speech|You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold]]". Classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406338 "Liberalism and Its History"], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a sea change in liberalism, with priority shifting from the producers to consumers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] represented the dominance of [[modern liberalism]] in politics for decades. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state.

[[Alan Wolfe]] summarizes the viewpoint that there is a continuous liberal understanding that includes both [[Adam Smith]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Alan|last = Wolfe|url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction |title = A False Distinction |work = The New Republic|date = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy...

It represents adherence to the bourgeois organization of society epitomized by that much-maligned word, "Victorian": with its faith in individualism, capitalism, progress, and virtue. Having been silenced by the seemingly endless march of "embedded liberalism" since the New Deal, American conservatism has, since the late 1960s, regrouped, and under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush created a new powerful political movement. Thus, apart from the brief period of Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy in Britain, it is only in the United States that the classical liberal tradition continues to have political force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual sources ==
=== John Locke ===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|160px|[[John Locke]]]]
Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', which had been written as a defence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22–23}}

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}

As a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to "as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23–24}}

Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}

=== Adam Smith ===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

Smith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

He assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}

=== Classical economics ===
In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the "[[dismal science]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}

Malthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71–72}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}

Ricardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73–74}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74–75}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}

=== Utilitarianism ===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

== Political economy ==
Classical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative "[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean "natural rights"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the "invisible hand" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on "scientific or economic principles" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

However, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}

''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Aspects of British Political History, 1815–1914''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-415-09006-3}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free trade and world peace ==
Several liberals, including Smith and Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to [[world peace]]. Erik Gartzke states: "Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that [[free market]]s have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. R.|first2=B. M.|title=The Classical Liberals Were Right: Democracy, Interdependence, and Conflict, 1950–1985|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=2|pages=267–294|year=1997|last1=Oneal|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00042|last2=Russet}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of mercantilism so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.}}

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith argued that as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies the spoils of war would rise, but that the costs of war would rise further and thus making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[T]he honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the aristocracy, watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure|[[Richard Cobden]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676244 "Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons"], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
{{quote|[B]y virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war, for the concept of cosmopolitan right does not protect them from it. The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers (or means) that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral motives); and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose.|[[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Perpetual Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small, but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was "brought up" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp; ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the way economies have been managed since his work, "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/book_reviews/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-economic-paths-to-war-and-peace/ John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace]  Donald Markwell (2006), reviewed by M S Lawlor (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational; and therefore unlikely.

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977''' was the fourth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], between 8 June 1977 and 15 June 1977, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[James Callaghan]]. President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda did not attend, and on the eve of the meeting President James Mancham of the Seychelles was overthrown and the country was not represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Derek|author2=Andrew Walker|title=Commonwealth Conference 1977|journal=The Round Table|date=July 1977|issue=267|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues discussed at the conference included the situation in Southern Africa, relations between rich and poorer nations, Cyprus, Belize, Uganda, and the issue of sporting contacts with South Africa. The [[Gleneagles Agreement]] on sporting contacts was reached at the meeting's retreat, in [[Gleneagles, Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Derek|author2=Andrew Walker|title=Commonwealth Conference 1977|journal=The Round Table|date=July 1977|issue=267|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consent theory''' is a term for the idea in [[social philosophy]] that individuals primarily make decisions as [[Free will|free agent]]s entering into consensual relationships with other free agents, and that this becomes the basis for political governance. An early elaborator of this idea was [[John Locke]], from whom the expression "[[all men are created equal]]" can be traced. Consent theory goes back at least to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Oh, Ye Are For Anarchy!": Consent Theory in the Radical Libertarian Tradition|author=C Watner|publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=1986|url=http://mises.org/sites/default/files/8_1_9_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism is after the original administering of consent by the people, subsequent generations often only give [[tacit consent]] to the government. Without the power to refuse consent, true consent cannot be given.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

{{Disability}}
'''Disability studies''' is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of [[disability]]. Initially the field focused on the division between "impairment" and "disability", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a [[social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=MLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Session Details: Avenues of Access: The State of Disability Studies|url=http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=570&amp;year=2013|website=Modern Language Association|publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the [[Social model of disability|social]] and [[medical model of disability|medical]] models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field.&lt;ref name=Models1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickenbacha|first1=Jerome E|last2=Chatterji|first2=Somnath|last3=Badley|first3=E.M.|last4=Üstün|first4=T.B.|title=Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1999|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1173–1187|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953698004419%20/%20bbib10|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged.&lt;ref name=MLA/&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-social"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=Guy|last2=Karen|first2=Clarke|last3=Randallb|first3=Dave|last4=Rouncefield|first4=Mark|last5=Sommerville|first5=Ian|title=The anti‐social model of disability|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=Oct 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/0968759042000181776|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.9006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs&gt;{{cite web|title=what is disability studies?|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/what_is_ds|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent investigations suggest using "cross-sectional markers of stratification"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siordia | first1 = C | year = 2014 | title = Disability Prevalence According to a Class, Race, and Sex (CRS) Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Racial &amp; Ethnic Health Disparities | volume =  2| issue = 3| pages =  303–310| doi = 10.1007/s40615-014-0073-8 | pmid = 26539340 | pmc = 4628829}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.

Disability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to [[civil rights]] and improving their [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=CAPUZZI SIMON|first1=CECILIA|title=Disability Studies: A New Normal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]].&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415914703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the [[Modern Language Association]] established disability studies as a “division of study.” &lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==History==
Universities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]]&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory/&gt; and its journal "[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the "Disability Studies Reader" Lennard J. Davis wrote that "it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities".&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that "all that has changed", but "just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415953337|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.&lt;ref name=DSQ:ProgramReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multinational Review Of English-Language Disability Studies Degrees And Courses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/issue/view/41|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i3.940 | last1 = Cushing | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Smith | first2 = Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[New York Times]] article "Disability Studies: A New Normal" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=Allegra|last2=Schwartz|first2=Ariel|title="It'll Grow Organically and Naturally": The Reciprocal Relationship between Student Groups and Disability Studies on College Campuses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2014|volume=34|issue=2|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4253/3593|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the transnational&lt;ref name=SDSAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://disstudies.org/about|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society for Disability Studies]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach.  Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.  Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.

*Challenging the view of disability as an individual deficit or defect that can be remedied solely through medical intervention or rehabilitation by "experts" and other service providers.  Rather, a program in Disability Studies should explore models and theories that examine social, political, cultural, and economic factors that define disability and help determine personal and collective responses to difference. At the same time, Disability Studies should work to de-stigmatize disease, illness, and impairment, including those that cannot be measured or explained by biological science.  Finally, while acknowledging that medical research and intervention can be useful, Disability Studies should interrogate the connections between medical practice and stigmatizing disability.
*Studying national and international perspectives, policies, literature, culture, and history with an aim of placing current ideas of disability within their broadest possible context.  Since attitudes toward disability have not been the same across times and places, much can be gained by learning from these other experiences.
*Encouraging participation by disabled students and faculty, and ensuring physical and intellectual access. Prioritizing leadership positions held by disabled people; at the same time, it is important to create an environment where contributions from anyone who shares the above goals are welcome."&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disability studies and medical humanities==
The [[social model of disability]] is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the [[medical humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garden|first=R|title=Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities|journal=Medical Humanities|date=December 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=70–4|pmid=21393285|doi=10.1136/jmh.2010.004143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. [[Infinite Ability]] has done some preliminary work in [[India]] to introduce disability studies to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Khosla, J |author3=Sridhar, S |title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2012|volume=54|issue=3|pages=296–7|pmid=23226869|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.102461|pmc=3512382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|author2=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian Medical Journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability|journal=Medical Education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|page=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersectionality==
[[Feminism]] introduces the inclusion of [[intersectionality]] in disability studies. It focuses on [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Class (social)|class]] and other related systems of [[oppression]] that can also intersect with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillborn|first=David|date=2015|title=Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism: Race, Class, Gender, and Disability in Education.|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–287|doi=10.1177/1077800414557827}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tina Goethals|first=|last2=Elisabeth De Schauwer|last3=Geert Van Hove|date=|year=2015|title=Weaving Intersectionality into Disability Studies Research: Inclusion, Reflexivity and Anti-Essentialism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:000f48af9d031f8db8036895074aa270|journal=Digest. Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies|language=en|volume=2|pages=75|doi=10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research on intersectionality and disability has focused on the aspect of being part of two or more stigmatized groups and how these are contributing factors to multiple forms of harassment, the paradox known as "Double Jeopardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Linda R.|last2=Chan|first2=Fong|last3=McMahon|first3=Brian T.|date=2011-12-29|title=Intersectionality and Disability Harassment|journal=Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=82–91|doi=10.1177/0034355211431167|issn=0034-3552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
Recent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race. Ellen Samuels explores [[Gender studies|gender]], queer sexualities, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstudies.wisc.edu/professional-pages/samuels.htm|title=Department of Gender and Women's Studies|date=2013-02-27|publisher=Womenstudies.wisc.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/resources/feministdisabilitystudies.aspx|title=Women and Disability: Feminist Disability Studies [Disability Studies&amp;#93;|publisher=Disabilitystudies.syr.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bell (scholar)|Christopher Bell]]’s posthumous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca/2009/12/obituary-chris-bell-disability-studies.html|title=Media dis&amp;dat: Obituary: Chris Bell, disability studies scholar on race, HIV/AIDS, dies|author=BA Haller|date=2009-12-26|publisher=Media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; volume on ''Blackness and Disability'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2N8uMz6g02gC|title=Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions - Google Boeken|year=2011|isbn=9783643101266|accessdate=2013-05-07|last1=Bell|first1=Christopher M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Robert McRuer]] both explore [[Queer theory|queerness]] and disability. These works engage with issues of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic oppression. Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] and Alison Kafer. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell’s "Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness" signalled a new direction of research — studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially "othered" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics. Empirical studies show that minority students are disproportionately more likely to be removed from class or school for "behavioral" or academic reasons, and far more likely to be labeled with intellectual or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies(DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors propose a union of critical race and disability studies, DisCrit, as an intersectional approach designed to analyzing the interaction between ableism, sexism, and racism.

In addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies.&lt;ref name="SDSBell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|title=chris bell memorial scholarship|website=Society for Disability Studies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160435/https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the [[intersectionality]] of oppression.  The [[University of Manitoba]] offers a course in on "Women with disabilities".&lt;ref name="ManitobaCourses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/disability_studies/contents/courses.html|title=Disability Studies Courses|website=University of Manitoba|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent masters' student research papers at [[York University]] focus on issues related to women with disabilities and people of African descent with disabilities.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdis.gradstudies.yorku.ca/ma/mrp/|title=COMPLETED MA PROJECT RESEARCH PAPERS|website=York University|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Feminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by "its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment". Garland-Thomson further describes that "identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie. "Integrating disability, transforming feminist theory." NWSA journal 14.3 (2002): 1-32|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism works towards [[accessibility]] for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a [[minority group|minority]]. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. [[Sara Ahmed]] elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in "Atmospheric Walls", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ahmed, Sara N. "Atmospheric Walls." Feministkilljoys. N.p., 2014. Web. 10 Oct. 2016|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerschick|first=Thomas J.|date=2000-07-01|title=Toward a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1263–1268|doi=10.1086/495558|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkerson|first=Abby|date=2002|title=Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|jstor=4316923|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=33–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
The intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It was only in 1973 that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=4|pages=565–575|pmc=4695779|pmid=26690228|doi=10.3390/bs5040565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) changed the listing of transgender to “gender dysphoria”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case ''[[In re Guardianship of Kowalski]]'', in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/us/gay-groups-are-rallied-to-aid-2-women-s-fight.html|title=Gay Groups Are Rallied To Aid 2 Women's Fight|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/us/disabled-woman-s-care-given-to-lesbian-partner.html|title=Disabled Woman's Care Given to Lesbian Partner|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.

A 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first=Karen I.|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun-Jun|last3=Barkan|first3=Susan E.|date=2012|title=Disability Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults: Disparities in Prevalence and Risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490559/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e16–e21|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300379|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490559|pmid=22095356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Though these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of "coming out" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Addressing Disability Stigma within the Lesbian Community|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43888838/Lesbian___Disability.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539886805&amp;Signature=JzL0VYPNkGAJAKigLgay9NP0i%2F0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAddressing_Disability_Stigma_within_the.pdf|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=81|pages=49–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coming out" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of "Double Jeopardy", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.

[[Queer studies]] which emerged from [[women's studies]], brings light towards the different kind of oppression [[queer]] and [[transgender]] people with disabilities have. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] dismisses [[gender disphoria]] because of its moral case against transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry |first=Kevin M. |title=Disabilityqueer: Federal Disability Rights Protection for Transgender People |date=February 18, 2014 |journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol16/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as “Crip” and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McRuer |first=Robert |title=Cripping Queer Politics, or the Dangers of Neoliberalism |website=S&amp;F Online |url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/cripping-queer-politics-or-the-dangers-of-neoliberalism/ |issue=10.1–10.2 |date=Fall 2011 – Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, "Feminist Queer Crip". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and "an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, queer, crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253009227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3GPb2obU0gC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Crip+Theory:+Cultural+Signs+of+Queerness+and+Disability#v=onepage&amp;q=Crip%20Theory:%20Cultural%20Signs%20of%20Queerness%20and%20Disability&amp;f=false|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|date=2006-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814761090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term "differing abilities", describes the label disability as  "a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Disabilities" vs. "Differing Abilities" |url=https://www.melwood.org/disabilities-vs-differing-abilities|website=Melwood|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the [[ableism]] that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society "as a structure for people who have no weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendell |first=Susan |title=Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability |journal=Hypatia |volume=4 |number=2 |year=1989 |pages=104–124 |jstor=3809809 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.

=== Social class ===
Within class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability. Disability looks different from a middle class, upper class, and lower class perspective, as well as through race, gender, and ethnicity. One's social class can contribute to when a person becomes disabled, rather it be sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F4X6yaiCNOcC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Feminist,+Queer,+Crip#v=onepage&amp;q=Feminist,%20Queer,%20Crip&amp;f=false|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2013-05-16|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253009418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where there is poverty we will find disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2zYEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Disability+Studies:+An+Interdisciplinary+Introduction#v=onepage&amp;q=Disability%20Studies:%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Introduction&amp;f=false|title=Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction|last=Goodley|first=Dan|date=2016-11-03|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473986930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poverty can include social, economic, and cultural poverty. Having a disability can contribute to poverty just as poverty can contribute to having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poverty and Disability: A Survey of the Literature|last=Elwan|first=Ann|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and be unemployed than those who do not, resulting in lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/disability.aspx|title=Disability &amp; Socioeconomic Status|last=|first=|date=|website=apa.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Questioning the social model===
The International Association of Accessibility Professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies|url=http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationprofoutline|website=International Association of Accessibility Professionals|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the '''social''' model of disability &lt;ref name=Models1999 /&gt; has recently{{When|date=January 2018}} been challenged.&lt;ref name="anti-social" /&gt; In a 2014 ''Disability Studies Quarterly'' article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and "question the rejection of the '''medical''' model" of disability.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups/&gt; The '''cultural affiliation''' model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=J|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|date=1994|publisher=Broadway Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''economic''' model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strnadová|first1=I|last2=Cumming,|first2=Therese|title=Lifespan transitions and disability : A holistic perspective|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the '''charity''' model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.  The '''functional solutions''' model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html |title=Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators |publisher=.ed.gov |date= 2018-09-25|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of cognitive and mental disabilities===
There is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of ''mental illness.'' However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Carol|title=Sociologies of disability and illness : contested ideas in disability studies and medical sociology|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403936363|page=131|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, [[Lancaster University]], this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities.  The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.

It is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship “psychological impairment” can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  Scholars such as [[Peter Beresford]] (2002) suggest "the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'" which would consider impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Yet others may recommend the "embodied approach," to the study of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

{{trade bloc}}
An '''economic partnership agreement''' is an [[trade agreement|economic arrangement]] that eliminates [[trade barrier|barriers]] to the free movement of [[Good (economics)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], and [[investment]] between countries. This agreement can be considered an intermediate step between [[free trade area]] and [[single market]] in the process of [[economic integration]]. Economic partnerships are sometimes described as ''high standard'' variants of free trade agreements.

One example is the Japan-Mexico Economic Partnership Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mofa.go.jp/POLICY/economy/fta/mexico.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edict of Restitution''', passed eleven years into the [[Thirty Years' War]] on March 6, 1629 following [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic]] successes at arms, was a belated attempt by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] to restore the [[religion|religious]] and territorial situations reached in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), whose "[[Reservatum ecclesiasticum|Ecclesiastical Reservation]]" had impeded the [[secularization]] of [[Catholic]] church lands after 1555, as no further Catholic church lands could legally be transferred to [[Protestant]] control. However, for several decades weak emperors had been unable to enforce the "Ecclesiastical Reservation" against Protestant encroachments.

== Background ==

This lack of decisive or effective authority along with the Protestant view of the legal interpretation as well as the value of the land and the characteristic dislike for all things Catholic led several princes to secularize the Catholic church lands under the treaty established and customary practice of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''. This usually occurred when a Catholic head of the church converted to Protestantism.

The [[Peace of Augsburg]], signed in 1555, had confirmed the result of the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)]]&lt;ref name="DOS-BOE"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-559499/Diets-of-Speyer| title= Diets of Speyer (German history) | work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia| accessdate= 2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had, by agreeing to disagree, ended with this principle as a prime result. With that principle confirmed by the Treaty at Augsburg, the violence of that earlier day between the [[Lutherans]] and the Catholics in Germany ended&amp;nbsp;—at least for the generation, until renewed tensions brought about the Thirty Years' War.

Behind all this were the inheritance practices in Europe as a whole and in particular [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|the German states]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Land and control over it was a source of both [[Political power|power]] and [[wealth]], and the [[nobility|noble families]] sought to control as much land within the extended family as was possible, for example by appointing younger sons prince-bishops or prince-abbots.

== The Edict ==
The "Edict of Restitution" was an attempt to ensure that the "[[Reservatum ecclesiasticum|Ecclesiastical Reservation]]" of the Augsburg treaty was retroactively enforced. It had a tremendously polarizing effect causing the approximately 1,800 states of the Holy Roman Empire to shatter into disparate blocks of opposed interests.

If fully effected, it would have affected the already secularized [[archbishop]]rics of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] and [[Magdeburg]], 12 bishoprics and over 100 religious houses around [[the German states]]. The Edict resulted in a great transfer of power and property away from the Protestants to the Catholics, and in effect broadened a divisive religious struggle into that plus a dynastic struggle for power, as seen from the viewpoint of many smaller German princes, who might otherwise have stayed neutral.

Other states were greatly affected when the mercenary armies marched through neutral states or ravaged them in the course of their foraging expeditions.  Thousands of Protestants fled to Protestant controlled states, generally broadening the war, and central Germany was ravaged repeatedly, by some estimates losing between 25–50% of its pre-war population because the competing armies continually took the food—the majority of civilian deaths being caused by the twin side-effects of famine, and deaths from endemic diseases under populations weakened by famine.

The greatest impact was in north-east [[Germany]]. It was here that Ferdinand's power was at its weakest. Ferdinand appointed Imperial administrators to take over the secularized states and cities, re-establishing Imperial authority in an area that had been free of Imperial rule for nearly 100 years. Ferdinand's actions were not well received by the princes. It was a move that alarmed the [[France|French]] and led to the French intervention in the war.

The German princes could do nothing. They had seen the Coalition destroyed. [[Wallenstein]] had a massive army of 134,000 troops in the field to enforce Imperial authority.

Wallenstein disliked the Edict as it trespassed into the region he considered his own but he played his part for the emperor to the full. He stated that "he would teach the [[prince-elector|Electors]] manners. They must be dependent on the emperor, not the emperor on them."  The response of the princes was to rally behind [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximillian of Bavaria]] to pressure Ferdinand into dismissing Wallenstein.

Their chance came in 1630 when Ferdinand called a meeting of the Electors in [[Regensburg]] because he wanted his son, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], elected King of the Romans. According to the law, the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was selected by a vote from the Electorate of German princes. Therefore, Ferdinand needed their cooperation to approve his son as successor. Ferdinand also hoped to persuade the Electors to approve greater Imperial involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War|European wars]].

[[John George I of Saxony]] and [[George William of Brandenburg]] (both Protestant) stayed away to protest the Edict of Restitution. Those Electors present realized that they had little to gain from additional involvement in the wars. However, Maximillian still asked Ferdinand for the dismissal of Wallenstein.

To win over the Electors, Ferdinand sacked Wallenstein in August 1630 though Wallenstein argued that he was allowed to resign to save face. The dismissal of the most powerful military figure in Europe was a major victory for the Electors and Regensburg must be seen as a defeat for Ferdinand.

All of this was overshadowed in July 1630&amp;nbsp;— [[Gustavus Adolphus]] landed in [[Pomerania]] with 4,000 men in response to the persecution of the Protestants. Without Wallenstein, Ferdinand had to turn to Maximillian and [[Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]] to stop the new threat.

In 1635 the Edict of Restitution was effectively revoked, with the terms of the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]].

The '''European Union value added tax''' (or '''EU VAT''') is a [[value added tax]] on [[Good (economics)|goods]] and services within the [[European Union]] (EU). The EU's institutions do not collect the tax, but [[member states of the European Union|EU member states]] are each required to adopt a [[value added tax]] that complies with the EU VAT code. Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states, ranging from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VATGlobal|url=http://www.vatglobal.com/eu-vat-table}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total VAT collected by member states is used as part of the calculation to determine what each state contributes to the [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budget]].

== Principle of VAT ==
{{Further information|Value added tax}}
EU VAT (known as "output VAT", that is, VAT on its output supplies) is charged by a business and paid by its customers. VAT that is paid by a business to other businesses on the supplies that it receives is known as "input VAT" (that is, VAT on its input supplies). A business is generally able to recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT is attributable to (that is, used to make) its taxable outputs. Input VAT is recovered by offsetting it against the output VAT for which the business is required to account to the government, or, if there is an excess, by claiming a repayment from the government. The final consumer does not receive a credit for the VAT paid. The net effect of this is that each supplier in the chain remits tax on the value added, and ultimately the tax is paid by the end consumer.

== Coordinated administration of value added tax within the EU ==
Value added tax collected at each stage in the supply chain is remitted to the tax authorities of the member state concerned and forms part of that state's revenue. A small proportion goes to the European Union in the form of a levy ("VAT-based own resources").

The co-ordinated administration of value added tax within the EU VAT area is an important part of the [[single market of the European Union|single market]]. Cross-border VAT is declared in the same way as domestic VAT, which facilitates the elimination of border controls between member states, saving costs and reducing delays. It also simplifies administrative work for [[freight forwarder]]s. Previously, in spite of the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]], the differing VAT rates and the separate VAT administration processes resulted in a high administrative and cost burden for cross-border trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/internet-and-ecommerce-vat/|title=Internet, eCommerce and VAT - Avalara VATLive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For private persons (not registered for VAT) who transport to one member state goods purchased while living or travelling in another member state, the VAT is normally payable in the state where the goods were purchased, regardless of any differences in VAT rates between the two states, and any tax payable on distance sales is collected by the seller.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, there a number of special provisions for particular goods and services.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== European Union VAT directive ==
The aim of the EU VAT directive (''Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax'') is to harmonize VAT within the EU VAT area, and specifies that VAT rates must be within a certain range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/eu-vat-directive/|title=EU VAT returns - Avalara VATLive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has several basic purposes:{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* harmonisation of VAT law (content)
* harmonisation of content and layout of the VAT declaration
* regulation of accounting, providing a common legal accounting framework
* detailed description of invoices (article 226) and receipts  (article 226b), meaning that member states have a common invoice framework
* regulation of [[accounts payable]]
* regulation of [[accounts receivable]]
* standard definition of national accountancy and administrative terms
The VAT directive is published in all EU official languages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Authority and scope of the tax ==
The [[Treaty of Rome|European Community Treaty]] ("EC Treaty") authorises the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Commission|Commission]]  to make [[regulation (European Union)|regulations]] and issue [[directive (European Union)|directives]].&lt;ref&gt;EC Treaty, Article 249, paragraph 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU VAT system is regulated by a series of [[European Union directive]]s, the most important of which is the Sixth VAT Directive.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 77/388/EC.&lt;/ref&gt; This directive has been updated and replaced by another directive&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32006L0112 Directive 2006/112/EC].&lt;/ref&gt; since 1 January 2007. Important changes will occur when a subsequent Directive will address the issue on "the place of supply of services" and will be in force on 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2008/8/EC.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010}}

== History ==
Most member states already had a system of VAT before joining the EU but for some countries, such as [[Spain]], VAT had to be introduced together with membership of the EU.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 1977, the Council of the European Communities sought to harmonise the national VAT systems of its member states by issuing the Sixth Directive to provide a uniform basis of assessment and replacing the Second Directive promulgated in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;sixth Directive, 77/388/EEC (17 May 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Council sought to improve on the Sixth Directive by recasting it.&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive, 2006/112/EC, (28 November 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
=== First Directive ===
On the harmonization of the legislation of the Member States with respect to turnover taxes (not applicable.) This act was adopted with the aim of replacing the multi-level cumulative indirect taxation system in the EU member states degree of simplification of tax calculations and neutrality of the indirect taxation factor in relation to competition in the EU.

=== Sixth Directive ===
The Sixth Directive characterised the EU VAT as harmonisation of the member states' general tax on the consumption of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;sixth Directive, 77/388/EEC, Article 2 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Directive defined a taxable transaction within the EU VAT scheme as a transaction involving the supply of goods,&lt;ref&gt;sixth Directive, 77/388/EEC, Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; the supply of services,&lt;ref&gt;sixth Directive, 77/388/EEC, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and the importation of goods.&lt;ref&gt;sixth Directive, 77/388/EEC, Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eighth Directive===
On harmonization of the legislation of the Member States with respect to turnover taxes - Provisions on the reimbursement of value added tax to taxable persons not established on the territory of the country (the provisions of this act allow a taxpayer of one Member State to receive a VAT refund in another Member State).

=== Recast Sixth Directive ===
The recast of the Sixth Directive retained all of the legal provisions of the Sixth Directive but also incorporated VAT provisions found in other Directives whilst rearranging the order of the text to make it more readable.&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive 2006/112/EC, (3) (28 November 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Recast Directive codified certain other instruments including a Commission decision of 2000 relating to funding of the EU budget from with a percentage of the VAT amounts collected by each Member State.&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive 2006/112/EC, (8) (28 November 2006)(making reference to Council Decision Euratom, 2000/597/EC (29 September 2000)).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supply of goods ==

=== Domestic supply ===
A domestic supply of goods is a taxable transaction where goods are received in exchange for consideration within one member state.&lt;ref&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one member state then charges VAT on the goods and allows a corresponding credit upon resale.

=== Intra-Community acquisition ===
An intra-Community acquisition of goods is a taxable transaction for consideration crossing two or more member states.&lt;ref&gt;^ Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title IV, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The place of supply is determined to be the destination member state, and VAT is normally charged at the rate applicable in the destination member state;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; however there are special provisions for distance selling (see [[#Distance sales|below]]).

The mechanism for achieving this result is as follows. The exporting member state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state "reverse charges" the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Distance sales ===
When a vendor in one member state sells goods directly to individuals and VAT-exempt organisations in another member state and the aggregate value of goods sold to consumers in that member state is below €100,000 (or the equivalent, e.g. in the UK as of April 2013 it is £79,000) in any 12 consecutive months, then such a sale of goods may qualify for a distance sales treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter I, Section 2, Article 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Distance sales treatment allows the vendor to apply domestic place of supply rules for determining which member state collects the VAT.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; This means that VAT is charged at the rate applicable in the exporting member state. However, there are some additional restrictions to be met. For instance, supply of new motor vehicles like cars, trucks and boats does not qualify.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter I, Section 2, Article 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, a compulsory VAT registration is required for a supplier of excisable goods to the UK (like tobacco and alcohol).

If sales to final consumers in a member state exceed €100,000, the exporting vendor is required to charge VAT at the rate applicable in the importing member state. If a supplier provides a distant sales service to several EU member states, a separate accounting of sold goods in regards to VAT calculation is required. The supplier then must seek a VAT registration (and charge applicable rate) in each such country where the volume of sales in any 12 consecutive months exceeds local threshold.

A special threshold amount of €35,000 is allowed if the importing member state fears that without the lower threshold amount competition within the member state would be distorted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Supply of services ==
A supply of [[Service (economics)|services]] is the supply of anything that is not a [[Good (economics)|good]].&lt;ref&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title IV, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general rule for determining the place of supply is the place where the supplier of the services is established (or "belongs"), such as a [[Permanent establishment|fixed establishment]] where the service is supplied, the supplier's permanent address, or where the supplier usually resides.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; VAT is then charged at the rate applicable in the member state where the place of supply of the services is located and is collected by that member state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

This general rule for the place of supply of services (the place where the supplier is established) is subject to several exceptions, if the services are supplied to customers established outside the Community, or to taxable persons established in the Community but not in the same country as the supplier. Most of the exceptions switch the place of supply to the place where the services are received. Such exceptions include the:
* supply of transport services,
* supply of cultural services,
* supply of artistic services,
* supply of sporting services,
* supply of scientific services,
* supply of educational services,
* supply of ancillary transport services,
* supply of services related to transfer pricing services,
and many miscellaneous services including
* supply of legal services,
* supply of banking and financial services,
* supply of telecommunications,
* supply of broadcasting,
* electronically supplied services,
* supply of services from engineers and accountants,
* supply of advertising services, and
* supply of intellectual property services.

The place of supply of services related to real estate is where the real estate is located.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

There are special rules for determining the place of supply of services delivered electronically.

The mechanism for collecting VAT when the place of supply is not in the same member state as the supplier is similar to that used for Intra-Community Acquisitions of goods, i.e. zero-rating by the supplier and reverse charge by the recipient of the services (if a taxable person). But if the recipient of the services is not a taxable person (i.e. a final consumer), the supplier must generally charge VAT at the rate applicable in its own member state.

If the place of supply is outside the EU, no VAT is charged.

== Importation of goods ==
Goods imported from non-member states are subject to VAT at the rate applicable in the member state into which the goods are imported, regardless of whether the goods are received for consideration and regardless of who imports the goods.&lt;ref&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title IV, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; VAT is generally charged at the border, at the same time as customs duty and using the price determined by customs.&lt;ref&gt;Recast sixth Directive, Council Directive 2006/112/EC, Title V, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of the action of EU administrative VAT relief, an exception called [[Low Value Consignment Relief]] is allowed on shipments of a low value.

VAT paid on importation is treated as input VAT in the same way as VAT on domestic purchases.

Following changes introduced on 1 July 2003, non-EU businesses providing digital [[electronic commerce]] and entertainment products and services to EU countries are also required to register with the tax authorities in the relevant EU member state, and to collect VAT on their sales at the appropriate rate, according to the location of the purchaser.&lt;ref name="Directive 2002/38/EC"&gt;Directive 2002/38/EC.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, under a special scheme, non-EU and non-digital-goods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6422332/europe-eu-vat-regulation-indies|title=Europe's New Tax 'Solution' May Have Created a Big Problem for Indie Artists, Labels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; businesses may register and account for VAT on only one EU member state.&lt;ref name="Directive 2002/38/EC" /&gt; This produces distortions as the rate of VAT is that of the member state of registration, not where the customer is located, and an alternative approach is therefore under negotiation, whereby VAT is charged at the rate of the member state where the purchaser is located.&lt;ref name="Directive 2002/38/EC" /&gt;

== Exemption from VAT ==
There is a distinction between goods and services that are exempt from VAT and those that are subject to 0% VAT. The seller of exempt goods is not entitled to reclaim VAT on business purchases, whereas the seller of goods and services rated at 0% is entitled.&lt;ref name="VAT Guide, Chapter 16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/vat-guide-ch16.pdf|title=VAT Guide, Chapter 16, Section 16.5 "Exemptions," p. 117|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be a book manufacturer in Ireland, who purchases paper including VAT at the 23% rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/rates/decision-detail-01248.jsp|title=VAT Rates: Pizza (Hot) – Food And Drink For Human Consumption|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sells books at the 0% rate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/rates/decision-detail-00007.jsp|title=VAT RAtes: Car Park Charges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manufacturer would be entitled to reclaim the VAT paid on the paper as the business is making taxable supplies.
In countries like Sweden and Finland non-profit organisations such as sports clubs are exempt from all VAT, and have to pay full VAT for purchases without reclaim.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}{{Clarify|reason=meaning unclear|date=February 2014}} Also in Malta, the purchase of food for human consumption from supermarkets, grocers etc., the purchase of pharmaceutical products, school tuition fees and scheduled bus service fares are exempted from VAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Government of Malta|title=What is Taxable, what is exempt?|url=http://www.vat.gov.mt/en/Pages/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.aspx|publisher=VAT Department Malta|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU commission wants to abolish or reduce the scope of exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/key_documents/communications/com_2011_851_en.pdf|title=COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE on the future of VAT Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=4 June 2014|quote="Broadening the tax base and limiting the use of reduced rates would generate new revenue streams at less cost"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are objections from sports federations since this would create cost and a lot of bureaucracy for voluntary staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rf.se/Arbetsrum/idrottspolitik/Momshotet/Vadinnebarmomshotet/ Vad innebär momshotet?] (rf.se){{sv}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406175833/http://www.rf.se/Arbetsrum/idrottspolitik/Momshotet/Vadinnebarmomshotet/ |date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eighth and Thirteenth Directives ==
Businesses can be required to register for VAT in EU member states, other than the one in which they are based if they supply goods via mail order to those states over a certain threshold. Businesses that are established in one member state but receive supplies in another member state may be able to reclaim VAT charged in the second state.&lt;ref&gt;Eighth VAT Directive.&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, businesses have a [[value added tax identification number]]. A similar directive, the Thirteenth VAT Directive, also allows businesses established outside the EU to recover VAT in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 86/560/EC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registering for VAT using Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) ==
To comply with these new rules, businesses need to decide whether or not they want to register to use the EU VAT Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) simplification scheme. Registration for MOSS is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/telecom/index_en.htm#one_stop|title=Telecommunications, broadcasting &amp;amp; electronic services - Taxation and customs union - European Commission|website=Taxation and customs union}}&lt;/ref&gt; If suppliers decide against the MOSS, registration will be required in each Member State where B2C supplies of e-services are made. With no minimum turnover threshold for the new EU VAT rules, VAT registration will be required regardless of the value of e-service supply in each Member State. EU MOSS registrations opened on 1 October 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxamo.com/moss-registration-portals/|title=MOSS registration – the definitive list  - Taxamo|website=www.taxamo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero rate derogation ==
Some goods and services are "zero-rated". The zero rate is treated like a positive rate of tax calculated at 0%. Supplies subject to the zero rate are still "taxable supplies", that is, they count as having VAT charged on them. In the UK, examples include most food, books, medications, and certain kinds of transport. The zero rate is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some member states, most notably the UK and Ireland, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These member states have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services. An EU member state may uplift their domestic zero rate to a higher rate, for example to 5% or 20%, however, EU VAT rules do not allow a reversal back to the zero rate once it has been given up. Member States may institute a reduced rate on a previously zero rated item even where EU law does not provide for a reduced rate, however if a Member State makes an increase from a zero rate to the prevalent standard rate, they may not then decrease down to a reduced rate unless specifically provided for in EU VAT Law (Annexe III of EU Dir 2006/112 list sets out where a reduced rate is permissible).

The UK also applies the lower rate on some products depending on how the supply is being made; for example, milk products bought from a retailer are subject to VAT at 0% rate, but milk drinks bought in a restaurant are subject to VAT at the standard 20% rate.

== VAT rates ==
Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states. The lowest standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 17%, although member states can apply reduced rates of VAT to certain goods and services. Certain goods and services are required to be exempt from VAT (for example, postal services, medical care, lending, insurance, betting), and certain other goods and services to be exempt from VAT but subject to the ability of an EU member state to opt to charge VAT on those supplies (such as land and certain financial services). Input VAT that is attributable to exempt supplies is not recoverable.

== EU VAT area ==
The EU VAT area is a territory consisting of territory of all [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] and certain other countries which follow the European Union's (EU) rules on value added tax (VAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/faq/faq_1179_en.htm#9|title=Taxation and Customs Union -&gt; Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is also valid for some special taxes on products like alcohol and tobacco.

Goods are only considered as imported or exported if they enter or leave the area. The VAT percentage does, however, differ from country to country within the area, which is a complicating factor, especially when, for example, an Internet-based reseller in one EU country sells to an EU customer in a different EU country.

When goods or services are sold to a ''company'' across a border within the area, either the buyer pays the sales country's VAT to the seller, or it is possible to register the transaction as an inter-company sale with no VAT being collected. If VAT has been paid the buyer cannot include it in their VAT accounts like VAT paid locally.

When goods or services are sold (and sent) to a ''private person'' across a border within the area, the buyer usually pays the sales country's VAT to the seller, and does not pay any VAT in the buyer's country. But if the seller's annual sales of goods to the buyer's country exceed a threshold (which varies by country), the seller must instead charge VAT in the buyer's country. These are known as the ''distance selling'' rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-725-the-single-market|title=VAT Notice 725: the single market - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a private person visits another EU country and buys goods, the seller does not have to take special action, just claim the local VAT, and the buyer can bring it home for personal use or gifts without limits.The 2015 EU VAT legislation requires two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to be produced so as to determine what VAT rate should be applied to these digital goods sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.taxamo.com/identifying-consumers-eu/|title=Taxamo Blog "Chart Courtesy Of The EU Taxation".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU sellers may validate the VAT number of a buyer residing within the EU Value Added Tax Area using [[VAT Information Exchange System|VIES]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4728">Throughout history, there were a number of political '''factions within the RSDLP''' ([[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]), in addition to the major split of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]].

* '''[[Bolsheviks]]''' formed in 1903 from the major split in the RSDLP which also produced the Mensheviks.  This faction followed [[Vladimir Lenin]], and organized a separate party, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, aka Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) in 1912.  After the [[October Revolution]], it became the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
*'''[[Borba (Paris)|Borba]]''', an expatriate group based in Paris
* '''[[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Labour Bund]]''' had an autonomous statute inside the RDSLP between the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|first congress]] in [[Minsk]] in March 1898 and the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|second congress]] in [[Brussels]] and [[London]] in August 1903, and again from the [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Fourth (Unification) Congress]] in [[Stockholm]] in April 1906.&lt;ref name=Angel&gt;Angel Smith, [[Stefan Berger]], "Nationalism, labour and ethnicity 1870-1939", Manchester University Press ND, 1999, pg. 150, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2GO7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=The+Bund+Menshevik&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Bund%20Menshevik&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Liquidators''' ('''Liquidationists''') were a faction of the Mensheviks who left in 1905 (plus their ideological compatriots who remained), maintaining that with the availability of legal participation in political life, the  underground revolutionary party must be liquidated.
* '''[[Mensheviks]]''' formed from the 1903 split with the Bolsheviks, under the leadership of [[Julius Martov]].  With the formal severing of ties in 1912, the Mensheviks used the name Russian Social Democratic Party (Mensheviks), or sometimes without the qualifier.  At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the majority supporting the war ("Defencists") maintained control of the RSDLP(M) under [[Fyodor Dan]] and others, while those opposed to the war left as the Menshevik Internationalists under Martov .
* '''Menshevik Internationalists''' were the faction who opposed involvement of Russian socialists in the war effort, who split from the Mensheviks in 1914 under that faction's founder, Martov.  It eventually merged with Mezhraiontsy, which later merged with the Bolsheviks.
* '''[[Mezhraiontsy]]''' formed in 1913 to attempt bridging the divide between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, but eventually merged in 1917 with the Bolsheviks.
* '''Otzovists''' (or '''Recallists''') were a group of radical [[Bolsheviks]] who demanded to cease all participation of the RSDLP in legal state establishments, in particular, to recall the RSDLP representatives from the  [[State Duma (Imperial)|State Duma]], hence the name ("to recall" is ''otozvat'' in Russian). Among the prominent Otzovists were [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky (politician)|Mikhail Pokrovsky]], [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], and [[Andrei Bubnov]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;James D.

==Definition==

Forensic genealogy is defined in a legal context, specifically when conducting research in the following manner:
*Estate or [[probate research]] to identify unknown and [[missing heir]]s, and potentially provide expert testimony in a courtroom;
**Unknown heir cases typically involve an individual's estate who died [[intestate]], but may also be the result of a [[remainderman]] predeceasing the [[testator]] or [[testatrix]] of a will.&lt;ref name="PaBarAssoc76.125"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramage |first1=Michael S. |title=Missing and Unknown Heir Law Practice and Procedure |journal=Pennsylvania Bar Association Quarterly |date=2005 |volume=76 |issue=July |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Missing heir cases involve locating [[beneficiaries]] of a will.&lt;ref name="PaBarAssoc76.125" /&gt;
*Military repatriation: Assisting branches of the United States military in reuniting the remains of service members with their families using DNA analysis (a.k.a. [[DNA profiling]]);
*[[Kinship]] determination: Identifying family members in regard to cases of adoption, foster care, and guardianship;
*Land and real estate issues involving title, [[adverse possession]], rights of way, [[lis pendens]], or [[muniment of title]], and oil, gas, and [[mineral rights]] and royalties. Oil, gas, and mineral rights cases may be dealt with the same as unknown and missing heir cases, or [[quiet title]] actions, depending on the state with jurisdiction and the situation of the case;&lt;ref name="RealPropJournal10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=American Bar Association |first1=Committee on Administration and Distribution of Decedent’s Estates |title=Clearing Title of Heirs to Intestate Real Property |journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal |date=1975 |volume=10 |issue=Fall |page=454 |jstor=20781390}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|454}}
**Established law in Texas gives landowners the rights to oil and gas beneath their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Surface Ownership |url=http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/media/7124/surfaceownerinfo.pdf |website=Railroad Commission of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research to help clients establish U.S. citizenship or support [[dual citizenship]] in a foreign country;
*Assisting coroner’s offices in identifying relatives of unclaimed remains;
*[[Provenance]], [[class action]] claimants, [[intellectual property rights]], etc.

A alternative definition of the field has been explained by author and scientist [[Colleen M. Fitzpatrick]], PhD, in her 2005 book ''Forensic Genealogy'',&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Fitzpatrick |first = Colleen |title = Forensic Genealogy |publisher = Rice Book Press |date = 2005 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Forensic_Genealogy.html?id=AKZpAAAAMAAJ |isbn =978-0976716006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a [[forensic science]] approach is used in genealogical research. The author describes various research methods, approaches, and genealogical knowledge she has determined to be forensic in nature:
*Examining photographs for clues to pinpoint a place or time of an event. For example, a house in the background of a photo may reveal an address number, or the type of clothing worn by people can suggest when a picture was taken. Colleen Fitzpatrick has stated “The most important lesson a digital detective can ever learn is to notice what a photograph is really saying.”;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
*Estimating birth dates by scrutinizing marriage age laws of a jurisdiction;
*Researching “the historical context of your family”&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;{{rp|3}} to provide more insight into their lives;
*Understanding that immigrant name changes did not occur at [[Ellis Island]], but either at the immigrant’s [[embarkation]] point or years after entry to the United States;
*Analyzing [[DNA]] test results to study both matches and non-matches, as well as estimating one’s [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), and discovering [[non-paternity event]]s;
*Using a Y-chromosome [[cladogram]] “to identify the main branches of a family”; etc.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Fitzpatrick |first = Colleen |title = Forensic Genealogy |publisher = Rice Book Press |date = 2005 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Forensic_Genealogy.html?id=AKZpAAAAMAAJ |isbn =978-0976716006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''Francesco Mario Pagano''' (8 December 1748&amp;nbsp;– 29 October 1799) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[jurist]], [[author]], [[Intellectual|thinker]], and the founder of the Neapolitan school of law.&lt;ref name=CambHistPolTht&gt;''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', ed. Goldie &amp; Wokler, 2006, p. 765&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as one of the most influential [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Tessitore, ''Comprensione storica e cultura'', Guida, 1979, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A moderate reformist, he is seen as a forerunner of the [[Italian unification]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brienza]] in the southern [[Province of Potenza]].  He studied at the [[University of Naples Federico II]] under [[Antonio Genovesi]].  At the age of twenty, he became special lecturer in [[moral philosophy]] there, at the same time practising law. He was friend of [[Gaetano Filangieri]], entering the masonry with him, and was elected venerable master of the Neapolitan [[masonic lodge|lodge]] "La philantropia". Pagano was one of the men who powerfully helped Italy in her social and scientific advancement and in the 1790s he had striven more than any other intellectual to give a political form to the 18th century reform tradition in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Imbruglia, ''Naples in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

His work ''Saggi politici'' (1783–85) provided a philosophical history of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], arguing against torture and capital punishment and advocating more benign penal codes. ''Considerazioni sul processo criminale'' (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), gave him international popularity and was much praised by ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'', the main newspaper of the [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]].&lt;ref&gt;Biancamaria Fontana, ''The Invention of the Modern Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794 he defended [[Vincenzo Galiani]], [[Vincenzo Vitaliani]] and [[Emanuele De Deo]]&amp;nbsp;– three alleged conspirators against [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]]; after they were sentenced to death, Pagano was deprived of his professorship, arrested, imprisoned and expelled from the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basilicatanet.it/conoscerebasilicata/cultura/biblioteca/Francesco%20Mario%20Pagano_en.htm Francesco Mario Pagano (1748-1799)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225174541/http://www.basilicatanet.it/conoscerebasilicata/cultura/biblioteca/Francesco%20Mario%20Pagano_en.htm |date=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After fleeing Naples in 1796, he returned in 1799 and drafted the constitution of the short-lived [[Neapolitan Republic (Napoleonic)|Neapolitan Republic]]. The document bore similarities to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] but presented original traits such as the institution of the "body of ephors", an authority who would have overseen the maintenance of the law. It is considered the precursor of the modern [[constitutional court]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Rosa Di Simone, ''Istituzioni e fonti normative in Italia dall'Antico Regime al fascismo'', p. 111, Giappichelli, Torino, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the republic, Pagano was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Castel Nuovo]]. He was executed by hanging at the [[Mercato (Naples)|"Piazza del Mercato"]] in Naples, along with other revolutionaries: [[Domenico Cirillo]], [[Giorgio Pigliacelli]] and [[Ignazio Ciaia]].

Pagano's other juridical or philosophical works included ''Progetto di Costituzione della Repubblica napoletana'', ''Sul processo criminale'', ''Esame politico dell’intera legislazione romana'', and ''Discorso sull’origine e natura della poesia''. He also translated works from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and wrote six tragedies (''Gerbino'', ''Agamennone'', ''Corradino'', ''Gli esuli tebani'', ''Prometeo'', and ''Teodosio'') and one comedy (''Emilia'').

'''Herman Oliphant''' (1884–1939) was a professor of law. He started at the [[University of Chicago]], going to [[Columbia University]] in 1922. He was originally from Forest, Indiana, the grandson of William Oliphant, an early pioneer of that area. Herman grew up on the family farm. In 1903, he graduated from Forest High School and attended Marion College. He returned home in 1905 to marry his childhood sweetheart, Julia Sims. In 1907, he graduated from Marion College and then went on to obtain degrees from Indiana University (1909) and his law degree from the University of Chicago in 1914. Shortly after his arrival at Columbia University, he wrote to the university's president, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], outlining some plans he had for reorganizing the curriculum of the law school. Essentially, his goal was to transform the school into a research center, placing particular emphasis on the interaction of the law and other social sciences. Under the administration of [[Huger Jervey]], who became dean of the law school in 1924, Oliphant's plans were used as the basis for a reorganization of the law school.

In his 1928 inaugural address as President of the American Association of Law School, Herman Oliphant said:  "Our case material is a gold mine for scientific work. It has not been scientifically exploited... We should critically examine all the methods now used in any of the social sciences and having any useful degree of objectivity."&lt;ref&gt;Herman Oliphant, A Return to Stare Decisis, 14 A.B.A. J. 71, 161 (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 he was co-author with [[Emily &amp; Theodore Hope Forest|Theodore S. Hope Jr.]] of "Study of Day Calendars" 1932, an in-depth look into how time effects trial cases.

Oliphant later went on to teach at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and later became the chief counsel of the [[United States Treasury Department]], serving in that capacity from 1934 to 1939. While serving in that position, he was regarded as an economic experimenter, and was the prime advocate of the [[Undistributed profits tax]].

While at the Treasury Department, he was lobbied by [[William Randolph Hearst]] to make [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] illegal. Hearst had recently become heavily involved in synthetics based on petroleum hydrocarbons, and wanted to quash efforts from competing companies to make similar products from hemp seed oil. Although that theory has been promoted for Oliphant's push for the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, his nephew Dr. Cleon O. Swayzee of Columbia University, in a 1984 interview stated two other reasons that took precedence for Oliphant's efforts. First was the influence of Oliphant's brother, Dr. Homer Oliphant, a physician who practiced in [[Forest, Indiana|Forest]] and [[Frankfort, Indiana]] and who was promoting the theory as early as 1919 that smoking was dangerous for the health of mothers and unborn babies. Granted Oliphant didn't do anything about smoking cigarettes. The second reason was that in the midst of the Great Depression with limited employment opportunities this endeavor was a vehicle to discourage immigration particularly from Mexico.

He is generally regarded as a representative of American [[legal realism]] and is famous for his statement that the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' is no longer applicable. Although the approach could be implemented in a time when society was relatively simply structured, in the present age it should be abandoned. To this effect, Oliphant pleaded a scientific approach. In his opinion, the way a judge deals with a case can be qualified as a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus-response]] situation, in the sense that the judge reacts to the stimulus of the case brought to his attention.

He died on January 11, 1939, of heart disease at the age of 54. He is buried in Frankfort, Indiana.

'''''In re Boucher''''' ([[case citation]]: No. 2:06-mJ-91, 2009 WL 424718), is a [[federal law#United States|federal]] [[criminal law|criminal]] [[legal case|case]] in [[Vermont]], which was the first to directly address the question of whether investigators can compel a suspect to reveal their [[encryption]] [[passphrase]] or [[password]], despite the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]]. A [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]] held that producing the passphrase would constitute self-incrimination. In its submission on appeal to the District Court, the Government stated that it does not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format by opening the drive before the grand jury. A District Court judge agreed with the government, holding that, given Boucher's initial cooperation in showing some of the content of his computer to border agents, producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination.

In late 2009, Boucher finally gave up his password and investigators found numerous images and videos [[Child pornography|depicting sexual abuse of children]]. In January 2010, Boucher was sentenced to 3 years in prison and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-man-sentenced-in-u-s-child-porn-case-1.904930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
On 17 December 2006, the [[laptop computer]] of [[defendant]] Sebastien D. Boucher (born in 1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011503663.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | title=In Child Porn Case, a Digital Dilemma | date=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katzjustice.com/boucherdocket.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was inspected when he crossed the border from Canada into the United States at [[Derby Line]], Vermont. The laptop  was powered-up when the border was crossed, which allowed its contents to be browsed. Images containing [[child pornography]] were allegedly seen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agents who seized the laptop, questioned Boucher and then arrested him on a complaint
charging him with transportation of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(1). The laptop was subsequently powered-down. When the laptop was switched on and booted on 29 December 2006, it was not possible to access its entire storage capability. This was because the laptop had been protected by [[PGP Disk]] encryption.&lt;ref name="In Re Boucher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2009/03-March/InreBoucherI.pdf |title=In Re Boucher |first=Jerome J. |last=Niedermeier |format=PDF|accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, investigators working for the US government were unable to view the contents of drive "Z:", which allegedly contained the illegal content. A grand jury then [[subpoena]]ed the defendant to provide the password to the [[key (cryptography)|encryption key]] protecting the data.

==Decision of the United States District Court==
On November 29, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge [[Jerome Niedermeier]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont]] stated "Compelling Boucher to enter the password forces him to produce evidence that could be used to incriminate him."&lt;ref name="In Re Boucher"/&gt; Accordingly, Niedermeier quashed the subpoena.

On January 2, 2008, the United States appealed the magistrate's opinion to the District Court in a sealed motion (court docket, case #: 2:06-mJ-00091-wks-jjn-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/07/america/legal.php |title=U.S. courts consider legality of laptop inspections |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |first=Adam |last=Liptak |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was heard by U.S. District Judge [[William K. Sessions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9854034-38.html |title=Feds appeal loss in PGP compelled-passphrase case | publisher=[[The Iconoclast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments were scheduled for April 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.vtd.uscourts.gov/doc1/1851300930 |title=CM/ECF Filer or PACER Login}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2009, Judge Sessions reversed the magistrate's ruling and directed  Boucher "to provide an unencrypted version of the Z drive viewed by the ICE agent."

{{quote|Boucher accessed the Z drive of his laptop at the ICE agent's request. The ICE agent viewed the contents of some of the Z drive's files, and ascertained that they may consist of images or videos of child pornography. The Government thus knows of the existence and location of the Z drive and its files. Again providing access to the unencrypted Z drive 'adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411.
 
Boucher's act of producing an unencrypted version of the Z drive likewise is not necessary to authenticate it. He has already admitted to possession of the computer, and provided the Government with access to the Z drive. The Government has submitted that it can link Boucher with the files on his computer without making use of his production of an unencrypted version of the Z drive, and that it will not use his act of production as evidence of authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf |title=In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher, Memorandum of Decision |date=February 19, 2009 |format=PDF |work=The Volokh Conspiracy |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">The '''Lausanne Congress''' of 1867 is the common name assigned to the 2nd General Congress of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), generally known as the First International. The meeting was held in the city of [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] from September 2 to 8, 1867. It was attended by 71 delegates, representing the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union|labor]] movements of Switzerland, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], and [[Belgium]].

==History==

===Background===

The International Workingmen's Association (IWA), commonly known as the First International, was an international association of trade unionist and socialist political activists which attempted to coordinate labor activities across national boundaries. The organization is remembered for the active participation of many pioneer leaders of the modern [[socialism|socialist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] movements, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Membership in the IWA was numerically small, its funding inadequate, and its institutional life short — lasting a mere 8 years from its establishment in 1864 until its termination at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress of 1872]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 1: 1864-1914.'' [1961] Henry Collins and Kenneth Mitchell, translators. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967; pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishment of the IWA was related to ongoing efforts to coordinate the activities of the trade union movements in Great Britain and France, a project begun in connection with the [[1862 International Exhibition|1862 London World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=JB88&gt;Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 1, pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic crisis had led the imperial French government to concede the right to French workers to elect a delegation of 750 to the London exhibition.&lt;ref name=JB88 /&gt; While in London certain members of this delegation headed by [[Henri Tolain]] (1828-1897) established contact with British trade union leaders and opened the door for a formal meeting in London the following summer in support of the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising of 1863]].&lt;ref&gt;Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 1, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWA first met in international session in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]] in September 1866 in an event remembered to history as the [[Geneva Congress (1866)|Geneva Congress]].

===Convocation===

The Lausannne Congress was called to order on September 2, 1867 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. There were 71 delegates in attendance, of whom the majority (38) were affiliated with the local Swiss labor movement.&lt;ref name=Stekloff99&gt;G.M. Stekloff, ''History of the First International.'' Eden Paul and Cedar Paul, trans. New York: International Publishers, 1928; pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in attendance were 18 representatives of the French labor movement, including Tolain and Karl Marx's future son-in-law [[Charles Longuet]]; 6 German delegates, including medical doctor [[Louis Kugelmann]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Büchner]]; 2 delegates each from Great Britain and Italy, and one from Belgium.&lt;ref name=Stekloff99 /&gt; In addition there were in attendance four members of the General Council of the IWA, headed by [[Johann Eccarius]].&lt;ref name=Stekloff99 /&gt;

Each delegate held one equal vote, regardless of the number of mandates of support he had received.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating derived their basic political ideas from the writings of French mutualist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions===

The gathering dealt with the organizational structure of the IWA and approved a uniform rate of dues of one English penny per capita, to be paid quarterly to the General Council in London.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt; It was decided that the General Council would in turn be obligated to issue reports on a quarterly basis to the central committees of its affiliated national organizations.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt;

The Congress debated the issue of national banks and the investment of trade union funds, ultimately approving a resolution made by Eccarius urging members of the IWA to work to "induce the trade unioins to devote their funds to cooperative production" rather than tying up the same assets in bank accounts.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt;

Also considered by the congress was the matter of education, opining in favor of the standard of free, compulsory, [[secular]] education.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWA, an international association of trade unionists from its creation, moved towards socialist advocacy at the Lausanne Congress, adopting a resolution calling for state ownership of transportation and exchange in order to break the hold of large companies on these institutions.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101 /&gt; This represented the first time that the organization had formally supported the principle of collective ownership.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101 /&gt;

'''Law practice management software''' is [[software]] designed to manage a [[Law Practice|law firm]]'s case and client records, [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing and [[bookkeeping]], schedules and appointments, deadlines, computer files and to facilitate any [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] requirements such as with document retention policies, courts' electronic filing systems and, in the UK, the [[Legal cashier#Solicitors.27 Accounts Rules|Solicitors' Accounts Rules]] as defined by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

==Purpose==
Because [[law school]]s do not generally teach new [[Lawyer|attorneys]] the business skills to run a law office, many offices have turned to technology to ease the learning curve and reduce clerical errors. The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has found that calendar and deadline related mistakes account for most [[legal malpractice]] claims. Therefore, an initial investment in software tools can yield long term savings in defending against such claims.&lt;ref name="Law.com"&gt;National Law Journal (April 18, 2005) - [http://www.law.com/jsp/law/sfb/lawArticleSFB.jsp?id=1113555910154 "How Small Firms Can ward Off Malpractice Suits"]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ABA has an entire section devoted entirely to law office management, of which software and related programs are an increasingly important part of its mission delivery. Many state bar associations also provide assistance&lt;ref name="abanet.org"&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/tech/ltrc/charts/PracticeCaseManagement-TimeBilling-IntegratedSoftwareChart.pdf Practice Management Software Comparison Chart from the ABA]&lt;/ref&gt; and discounts to their members for such software.&lt;ref name="njsba"&gt;[http://www.njsba.com/NJSBAstatic/law_office_manage/dsp_software.cfm New Jersey State Bar Association official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726020851/http://www.njsba.com/NJSBAstatic/law_office_manage/dsp_software.cfm |date=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of these programs is to allow a law firm to run more smoothly.&lt;ref name="Law Office Management Software"&gt;Amy Hall, [http://www.articleinsider.com/article/170842 ''Law Office Management Software''], retrieved from ''Article Insider''&lt;/ref&gt;

Case Management Software, used properly, improves efficiency, provides for conflict checking, and enables a law office to not have to search for the physical file each time a client calls with questions, thereby helping to reduce the need for callbacks since the client can get answers on an as needed basis at the time of their inquiry. &lt;ref&gt;https://lawfirmpracticemanagementadvice.com/2016/02/14/cloud-based-practice-management-software/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the industry==
Legal law office management is a growing business in [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]] due to the highly competitive market to gain customers. In the UK, the [http://www.lssa.co.uk/ Legal Software Suppliers Association (LSSA)] is the industry body for legal software systems developers and vendors. Representing a selection of UK suppliers and chaired by the chairman of one of the suppliers, it claims that it sets and maintains professional standards within the industry and manage areas of mutual interest between lawyers and software providers – such as the Land Registry, LSC, Law Society &amp; other legislative bodies.

==Types of software==
Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables. Attorneys/Solicitors often buy their software based on their practice area. The New Jersey State Bar Association web site&lt;ref name="njsba"/&gt; lists a variety of applications by substantive law (Bankruptcy, Collections, Estate planning and administration, and Real estate) as well as by practice matter (Calendar/Schedule/Docket Control, Case &amp; Practice Management, Document Assembly, and Document Management).

Regardless of the type of law practiced, practice management software (a form of [[Customer relationship management]] software) is among the most important. Features of practice management software include:
* Case management [[Database|(databases]], checking [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and [[Statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]])
* [[Time tracking]] (for billing)
* [[Document assembly]]
* [[Contact management]]
* Calendaring
* Docket management
* Client communication&lt;ref name="abanet.org"/&gt; 
* Contract Management 
* Court Case Status Tracker

Other software systems that are useful for law firms include: [[Password]] security, [[Disk encryption]], [[Mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|Open source]] software.&lt;ref name="Law Office Management Software"/&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[Computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[Legal research]]. Such databases provide [[Case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, including the free [[Google Scholar]], and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110908">An '''enacting clause''', or '''enacting formula''', is a short phrase that introduces the main provisions of a [[law]] [[Coming into force|enacted]] by a [[legislature]]. It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.

The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in [[Australia]] since 1990 is "The Parliament of Australia enacts".&lt;ref name="aust"/&gt; Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of [[popular sovereignty]], has the following enacting clause: "The People of the State of California do enact as follows."{{ref|US-CA}}

===Belgium===

In Belgium the enacting formula appears in the official journal (Belgisch Staatsbald/Moniteur belgue) when the law is promulgated and published, but is usually thereafter not included when the law is printed in compilations, or stored in internet databases, even official ones. The enacting clause is as follows.

{{quote|N. (e.g. PHILIPPE), King of the Belgians: To all, present and to come, greeting. The Chambers have adopted and We sanction the following: (the articles of the law then follow. After the last article of the law the enacting formula continues). We promulgate the present law, order it to be sealed with the State Seal and published in the Moniteur belge/Belgisch Staatsbald}}
{{quote|{{lang-fr|N. (PHILIPPE), Roi des Belges, A tous, présents et à venir, Salut. Les Chambres ont adopté et Nous sanctionnons ce qui suit (...) Promulguons la présente loi, ordonnons qu’elle soit revêtue du sceau de l’Etat et publiée par le Moniteur belge.}}}}
{{quote|{{lang-nl|N. (FILIP), Koning der Belgen, Aan allen die nu zijn en hierna wezen zullen, Onze Groet. De Kamers hebben aangenomen en Wij bekrachtigen hetgeen volgt (...) Kondigen deze wet af, bevelen dat zij met ’s Lands zegel zal worden bekleed en door het Belgisch Staatsblad zal worden bekendgemaakt.}}}}

===Belize===
'''[[Parliament of Belize]]''':

{{quote|"BE IT ENACTED, by and with the advice and consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate of Belize and by the authority of the same, as follows:-"}}

===Brazil===
'''[[National Congress of Brazil]]''':

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu sanciono a seguinte Lei:"'}}}}

In Brazil the presidential assent to a bill is called "sanction". After passing both Houses of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate), the final version of the bill, duly signed by the presiding officers of both Houses, is sent to the President of the Republic. The document is still called a "proposed law", with a bill number, and with the header "''The National Congress decrees:''" (In Portuguese: ''"O Congresso Nacional decreta:"''). If the President approves the bill, a different copy of the act is prepared by the Presidency of the Republic, with the official number of the Law and the date of enactment of the law, and also with the replacement of the clause "The National Congress decrees:" with the above mentioned formula "''THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:''". The signatures of the presiding officers of Congress are therefore not present in this version of the act. This is the version of the statute that is published in the Official Journal and that is included in the statute books. When granting his approval to a bill, the President signs both the bill sent to him by Congress and the final version of the statute with the presidential enacting formula. The signed Bill is returned to Congress by means of a presidential message; the signed statute with the presidential enacting formula is printed in the Official Journal, and the original is thereafter sent to the National Archive.
Thus, in Brazil, the President is always seen signing two different documents at bill signing ceremony (the two documents are called the "autographs"): one is the text of the proposed law, the other is the final text of the statute. Technically, the first signature (on the Bill) is the "sanction to the proposed law", that is, the approval of the bill, that transforms it in a Law, and the second signature (on the statute with the presidential enacting formula) is the promulgation, the announcement to the people that the Law has been adopted. While the signature of the President on the bill includes the addition of the formula "I sanction it" (in Portuguese: "Sanciono") above the signature, this is not seen in the final "promulgation" version of the statute. On the other hand, the promulgated statute contains not only the signature of the president, but also the countersignatures of his ministers principally charged with applying the law.

When the president vetoes a bill, and the veto is overridden, the Bill is returned by Congress to the President not for sanction (approval), but merely for promulgation. In that case, the president is expected to promulgate the bill in 48 hours. In that situation, the enacting formula that appears in the final text of the adopted statute is as follows:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress maintained and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional manteve e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Tacit sanction (i.e. implicit approval) is deemed to take place if the president fails to sign or veto a bill within the constitutionally mandated timeframe of fifteen working days from receiving the bill. Once the bill is considered implicitlly sanctioned, the president is expected to promulgate the new law and the same 48-hour timeframe applies. The formula in this case is:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Should the president refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after his veto has been overridden by Congress, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"The President of the FEDERAL SENATE promulgates, in accordance with art. 66 §7, of the Federal Constitution, the following Law, that results from bill vetoed by the President of the Republic and maintained by the National Congress:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O Presidente do SENADO FEDERAL promulga, nos termos do art. 66, § 7, da Constituição Federal, a seguinte Lei, resultante de Projeto vetado pelo Presidente da República e mantido pelo Congresso Nacional:"}}}}

Should the president of the Republic refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after the bill has been implicitly sanctioned due to his failure to sign or veto it within the constitutionally mandated timeframe, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"I make it known that the NATIONAL CONGRESS enacted, the President of the Republic, in accordance with the provisions of §3 of the art. 66 of the Constitution, sanctioned, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, in accordance with the §7 of the same article, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o CONGRESSO NACIONAL aprovou, o Presidente da República, nos termos do § 3o do art. 66 da Constituição, sancionou, e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, nos termos do § 7o do mesmo artigo promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Whenever the president adopts a provisional measure and the provisional measure is approved by Congress with changes, a normal bill is sent to the president for approval or veto, and the same formulas used for other bills are employed; once enacted, the new statute replaces the provisional measure. However, if the provisional measure adopted by the president is approved by Congress without changes, the bill does not need to be presented for approval or veto; in that case, the law that both corresponds fully to the provisional measure and replaces it is promulgated directly by the President of the Senate, with the following words:

{{quote|"I make it known that the President of the Republic adopted the Provisional Measure number NNN of YYYY, that the National Congress approved, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, for the effects of the provision of the sole paragraph of art. 62 of the Federal Constitution, do promulgate the following Law:"}}

'''General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil''' (1822-1889)

Whenever the General Assembly of the Empire (made up of a Senate and of a Chamber of Deputies) passed a bill, a decree of the General Assembly containing the articles of the approved bill was sent to the Emperor for sanction or veto. The Decree of the General Assembly began with the following formula (that did not appear in the final version of the statute, after the imperial sanction): "''The General Assembly decrees:''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral decreta:''"). The decree was still only a proposed law, that would become an actual law if sanctioned by the Emperor. The General Assembly sent its decree to the Emperor for sanction or veto by means of a message with the words following: "''The General Assembly sends to the Emperor the enclosed decree, that it considers advantageous, and useful to the Empire, and it asks that His Imperial Majesty may be pleased to grant it His sanction''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral dirige ao Imperador o decreto incluso, que julga vantajoso e útil ao Império, e pede a Sua Majestade Imperial, se digne dar a Sua sanção"''). If the Emperor decided to sanction the decree, then he sent the message of the General Assembly back to the Legislature, adding after the text of the Decree of the General Assembly the following words, together with the date and his signature: ""''The Emperor consents''" (in Portuguese: "''O Imperador consente''"). Then, the Executive branch prepared a formal document to promulgate the new law, and this document was known in the imperial period as a ''Charter of Law'' (in Portuguese: ''Carta de Lei''). It was the chartered version of the law that was included in the statute books and that was printed and published for the knowledge of the people. Thus, the Charter of Law was the final version of the statute as adopted. It was signed by the Emperor and countersigned by his responsible Ministers, and contained an enacting formula as follows:

{{quote|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PETER THE SECOND"), by the grace of God and unanimous acclamation of the peoples, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil: We make it known to all Our subjects that the General Assembly has decreed and We will the following law: 
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows). 
We command, therefore, all the authorities whom the knowledge and execution of this present Law may concern, that they comply with it and that they make it be complied with and kept, as faithfully and as fully as provided herein. The Secretary of State of the Affairs of... (title of the responsible Minister of the Crown who countersigns the Act with the Emperor and who heads the Department principally charged with applying the Law) is to make this Law be printed, published and circulated. Given at the Palace of... on (day) of (month) of (year), in the (year) of the Independence and of the Empire.}}

{{quote|{{lang-pt|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO"), por graça de Deus e unânime aclamação dos povos, Imperador Constitucional e Defensor Perpétuo do Brasil: Fazemos saber a todos os Nossos súditos que a Assembleia Geral decretou e Nós queremos a seguinte lei:

When the powers of the Emperor were discharged by Regents on behalf of the monarch the formula was as follows:

{{quote|The Regency (or "The Regent"; or "The Princess Imperial Regent"), in the Name of His Majesty the Emperor, the Lord (name of the Emperor preceded by the title "Dom", e.g., "Dom Pedro II"), makes it known to all the subjects of the Empire that the General Assembly has decreed and it (or "He" or "She") sanctioned the following law:

'''Malice murder''' is a [[criminal law|criminal offence]] in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], committed when a [[homicide]] is done with express or implied [[Malice (law)|malice]].

==Definition==
Express malice is "that deliberate intention unlawfully to take the life of another human being which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof."  Malice is implied when "no considerable provocation appears and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-16/chapter-5/article-1/section-16-5-1 2014 Georgia Code, § 16-5-1 - Murder; malice murder; felony murder; murder in the second degree, from Law.Justia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Justin Ross Harris]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]], was convicted in November 2016 of malice murder in the June 2014 death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Prosecutors argued that unhappily married and wanting an escape from family life, he intentionally killed his son by leaving him for about seven hours in the back seat of his vehicle outside the suburban Atlanta office in which he worked. Temperatures in the Atlanta area that day reached at least into the high 80s.  Investigators found evidence that he was engaging in online flirtations and in-person affairs with numerous women other than his wife, including a prostitute and an underage teenager. Harris was found guilty of all eight counts against him. In addition to malice murder and felony murder charges, he was also found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and sending her nude photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/georgia-man-sentenced-to-life-without-parole-for-sons-death-in-hot-car.html|title=Georgia Man Sentenced to Life Without Parole for Son’s Death in Hot Car|last=The Associated Press|date=2016-12-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marta Andreasen''' (born 26 November 1954) is an Argentine-born Spanish accountant, employed in January 2002 by the [[European Commission]] as Chief Accountant,&lt;ref name=laidbare&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', pg. 20. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and notable for raising concerns about flaws in the commission's accounting system which she felt left the commission vulnerable to potential fraud. Elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 election]], she defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in February 2013.&lt;ref name='BBCFeb'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21555727|title=UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen defects to Conservatives|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lost her seat in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Henley |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-27572317 |title=UKIP gains seats and share in South East EU vote |publisher=BBC News |date=2014-05-26 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
She qualified in 1977 as a [[certified public accountant]] in Buenos Aires, then worked for five years as an [[auditor]] at [[Pricewaterhousecoopers]]. From 1982 on she worked as a finance and administration manager, then as a regional finance director at various companies, such as [[Rockwell Automation]] and [[Lotus Development]], mostly in Spain. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==OECD==
She joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1998, where she reported serious problems with its accounting system, raised her concerns with the management and suggested ways of reforms. After initial resistance, [[Arthur Andersen]] were assigned for an outside analysis.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} In August 2000, their report described the OECD's internal accounting systems as outdated and inadequate. Andreasen, however, was suspended from her job for 15 months. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

''[[Accountancy Age]]'' stated in October 2003 that Andreasen's spell at the OECD ended with "her bid to take the organisation to the European Court of Justice claiming her human rights had been violated as she had not been given a 'fair trial' following allegations of racism, and that she raised 'undue doubts' and unsupported 'alarmist allegations' in relation to OECD accounts." 
 
The OECD never confirmed allegations of racism were part of the cause for her suspension. Andreasen had already dismissed those in ''Accountancy'' magazine in October 2000 ("Andreasen claims allegations against her emerged only after she had raised concerns about the accounts").

==Brussels==
In January 2002 she began her new job in Brussels as Chief Accountant&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', page 10. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ("budget execution director and accounting officer"), the first professional accountant hired.&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, Marta: ''Brussels Laid Bare'', page 31. St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns over EU's accounting===
Andreasen criticised the EU's accounting system for being open to fraud.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Andreasen, Marta: Brussels Laid Bare, St. Edwards Press Ltd, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She raised her criticisms and proposals for overdue improvements and changes internally, but made no progress with her superior. She then submitted her report to the [[Commissioner]] [[Michaele Schreyer]] and the Commission President [[Romano Prodi]]. She again received no answers and so approached members of the [[EU Parliament]]’s [[Budget Control Committee]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

She, consequently, refused to sign off the 2001 [[European Commission]] accounts. In the discharge procedure in 2003 the Commission promised comprehensive reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.euabc.com/word/43 ''Marta Andreasen'' entry] in the euabc.com (somewhat dated)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.justresponse.net/DougalWatt16Sep02.html The Marta Andreasen and Fabra Valles cases: an exclusive JUST Response report from the Dougal Watt Dossier – Mismanagement and Corruption in Europe]'' – Letter from [[Robert Dougal Watt]], Auditor, European Court of Auditors, to [[Michel Hervé]], Secretary General, European Court of Auditors, 16 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage the media began to investigate and to report. Andreasen went public with her concerns on 1 August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Barrow: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1403393/Im-not-a-politician-just-a-bean-counter-says-Andreasen.html "I'm not a politician — just a bean-counter, says Andreasen"]. ''The Daily Telegraph''. 2 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacking===
Andreasen was fully suspended from her job by the Commission in May 2002 (for "violating Articles 12 and 21 of staff regulations, failure to show sufficient loyalty and respect"). She is said to have been suspended from her job and ultimately fired because she refused to sign accounts she believed were unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docop=docop&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;typeord=ALLTYP&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=&amp;ddatefs=08&amp;mdatefs=11&amp;ydatefs=2007&amp;ddatefe=08&amp;mdatefe=11&amp;ydatefe=2007&amp;nomusuel=Andreasen&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100&amp;Submit=Suchen Andreasen v Commission] at curia.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 2007 Andreasen became the Treasurer of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), which is committed to withdrawing the United Kingdom from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7030970.stm UKIP prepares for battle over EU]'', BBC News, 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 elections to the European Parliament]] she was elected as a UKIP [[member of the European Parliament]] for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] and immediately joined the Parliament's influential [[Committee on Budgetary Control]], although the [[European People's Party]] group blocked her bid to become a vice-chair of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2246504/andreasen-fails-bid-budget Andreasen fails in bid for EU budget committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725092717/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2246504/andreasen-fails-bid-budget |date=25 July 2009 }}, ''Accountancy Age'', 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, she resigned from her post as Treasurer of UKIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marta Andreasen, UKIP's treasurer and Brussels whistleblower, resigns|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6825234.ece|publisher=The Times|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Andreasen announced her intention to apply for the vacant position of Director-General of the [[European Anti-fraud Office]] (OLAF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2261409/whistle-bower-seeks-head-eu Whistleblower seeks to head EU anti fraud unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082359/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2261409/whistle-bower-seeks-head-eu |date=19 June 2010 }}, ''Accountancy Age'', 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no subsequent report that she had actually sent in such an application.

After what she considered a disappointing election result for UKIP in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2011|local elections of May 2011]], Andreasen called for her leader [[Nigel Farage]] to resign. The party responded that it had made gains in the election and that her statement "displays what one might perhaps charitably call a naivety in its analysis of the UK electoral scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13348940 | work=BBC News | title=Call for UKIP's Nigel Farage to resign as double act turns sour | date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a TV interview, Farage himself responded that Andreasen was out of touch and "didn't know what she was talking about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Junius |url=http://juniusonukip.blogspot.com/2011/05/ukip-marta-andreasen-threatens-legal.html |title=UKIP: Marta Andreasen threatens legal action against Nigel Farage |publisher=Juniusonukip.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, she told [[RTÉ Radio 1]]'s ''[[Morning Ireland]]'' that the Irish government's nomination of [[Kevin Cardiff]] to the [[European Court of Auditors]] should be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1107/finance.html "Kevin Cardiff nomination questioned by MEP"], ''[[RTÉ News]]'', 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, she defected from UKIP to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], describing leader [[Nigel Farage]] as "a Stalinist" who was "anti-women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21555727 | work=BBC News | title=UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen defects to Conservatives | date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She lost her seat at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 election]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] originated{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the padayatra with his famous [[Salt March]] to [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] in 1930. In the winter of 1933-34, Gandhi went on a countrywide padayatra against untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where Gandhi Meets Ambedkar|author=Ramachandra Guha|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-11-08/edit-page/27860607_1_untouchability-padayatra-hindu |publisher=The Times of India |date=Nov 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gandhian [[Vinoba Bhave]] also started a padyatra, which was part of his [[Bhoodan movement]] in 1951.

The '''People's Courts of [[Bavaria]]''' (''{{lang|de|Volksgerichte}}'') were ''{{lang|de|[[Sondergericht|Sondergerichte]]}}'' (special courts) established by [[Kurt Eisner]] during the [[German Revolution]] in November 1918 and part of the [[:de:Ordnungszelle|Ordnungszelle]] that lasted until May 1924 after handing out more than 31,000 sentences. It was composed of two judges and three [[lay judge]]s.{{sfn|Bauer|2009}}{{sfn|Landauer|1944|p=221}} One of its most notable trials was that of the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] conspirators, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Erich Ludendorff]], [[Wilhelm Frick]], [[Friedrich Weber (veterinarian)|Friedrich Weber]], and [[Ernst Röhm]], which lasted from 26 February 1924 until 1 April 1924.{{sfn|Hitler|1924}}{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68–69}}

Initially established in each court district by the Order of 16 November 1918 (''{{lang|de|Verordnung vom 16 November 1918}}'') by the government of Kurt Eisner, it was furthered by the government of [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]] in the Law on the Establishment of People's Courts in Civil Disturbances of 12 July 1919 (''{{lang|de|Gesetz über die Einsetzung von Volksgerichten bei inneren Unruhen vom 12 Juli 1919}}'').{{sfn|Bauer|2009}} An agreement between the federal government and the government of Bavaria had fixed the deadline for the abolition of the courts on 1 April 1924.{{sfn|Landauer|1944|p=222}} In this form they remained until May 1924 after handing out more than 31,000 sentences.{{sfn|Bauer|2009}} Initially intended as a short-term solution for events surrounding the German Revolution, they became seen as part of the [[:de:Ordnungszelle|Ordnungszelle]].{{sfn|Bauer|2009}}

{{Wiktionary|possession}}
{{Property law}}

In law, '''possession''' is the  control a person's intentional exercises toward a thing. In all cases, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply [[ownership]]). Like ownership, the possession of anything is commonly regulated by country under [[property law]].

==Intention to possess==
An intention to possess (sometimes called ''animus possidendi'') is the other component of possession. All that is required is an intention to possess something for the time being. In [[common law]] countries, the intention to possess a thing is a fact. Normally, it is proved by the acts of control and surrounding circumstances.

It is possible to intend to possess something without knowing that it exists. For example, if you intend to possess a suitcase, then you intend to possess its contents, even though you do not know what it contains. It is important to distinguish between the intention sufficient to obtain possession of a thing and the intention required to commit the crime of possessing something illegally, such as banned drugs, firearms or stolen goods.&lt;ref name="Teh HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|43|1985|litigants=[[He Kaw Teh v R]] |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 523 |courtname=auto |date=11 July 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The intention to exclude others from the suitcase and its contents does not necessarily amount to the guilty mind of intending to possess illegally.

When people possess places to which the public has access, it may be difficult to know whether they intend to possess everything within those places. In such circumstances, some people make it clear that they do not want possession of the things brought there by the public. For example, it is not uncommon to see a sign above the coat rack in a restaurant which disclaims responsibility for items left there.

==Importance of possession==
Possession is one of the most important concepts in [[property law]]. There are three related and overlapping but not identical legal concepts: possession, right of possession and ownership.

In common law countries, possession is itself a property right. The owner of a property has the [[right of possession]] and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right of possession to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right of possession to a property manager under a property management [[contract]] who may then assign the right of possession to a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] under a rental agreement. There is a [[rebuttable presumption]] that the possessor of property also has the right of possession, and evidence to the contrary may be offered to establish who has the legal right of possession to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment of the right of possession) or evidence of a superior right of possession without ownership. Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of possession and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive possession of a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse [[easement]] for use is granted by a court.

In civil law countries, possession is not a right but a (legal) fact which enjoys certain protection by the law. It can provide evidence of ownership but it does not in itself satisfy the burden of proof. For example, ownership of a house is never proven by mere possession of a house. Possession is a factual state of exercising control over an object, whether owning the object or not. Only a legal (possessor has legal ground), bona fide (possessor does not know he has no right to possess) and regular possession (not acquired through force or by deceit) can become ownership over passage of time. A possessor enjoys certain judicial protection against third parties even if he is not the owner.

There may be varying degrees of rights to possession. For example, if you leave a book that belongs to you at a cafe and the waiter picks it up, you have lost possession. When you return to recover the book, even though the waiter has possession, you have a better right to possession and the book should be returned. This example demonstrates the distinction between ownership and possession: throughout the process you have not lost ownership of the book although you have lost possession at some point; or instead, the book may have been owned by a third party (such as a [[lending library]]) throughout, despite the changes in possession.

==Obtaining possession==
Possession requires both control and intention. It is obtained from the first moment that both those conditions exist simultaneously. Usually, intention precedes control, as when you see a coin on the ground and reach down to pick it up. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a person might obtain control of a thing before forming the intention to possess it. If  unknowingly sat on and therefore had control of a $10 note on the seat of a train, he or she could obtain possession by becoming aware of the note and forming the intention to possess it. People can also intend to possess things left, without their knowledge, in spaces they control.

Possession can be obtained by a one-sided act by which factual control is established. This can take the form of apprehension (taking an object not in someone's possession) or seizure (taking an object in someone's possession). It can also be obtained through a two-sided process of handing over the possession from one party to another. The party handing over possession must intend to do so.

===Possession acquired by consent===
Most property possessed is obtained with the consent of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased, received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The transfer of possession of goods is called [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]]. For land, it is common to speak of granting or giving possession.

A temporary transfer of possession is called a [[bailment]]. Bailment is often regarded as the separation of ownership and possession. For example, the library continues to own the book while you possess it and will have the right to possess it again when your right comes to an end. A common transaction involving bailment is a conditional sale or hire-purchase, in which the seller lets the buyer have possession of the thing before it is paid for. The buyer pays the purchase price in installments and, when it is fully paid, ownership of the thing is transferred from seller to buyer.

===Possession acquired without consent===
It is possible to obtain possession of a thing without anyone else's consent. First, you might take possession of something which has never been possessed before. This can occur when you catch a wild animal; or create a new thing, such as a loaf of bread. Secondly, you might find something which someone else has lost. Thirdly, you might take something from another person without their consent. Possession acquired without consent is a property right which the law protects. It gives rise to a right of possession which is enforceable against everyone except those with a better right to possession.

===Forms of transferring possession===
There are various forms of transferring possession. One can physically hand over the object (e.g. handing over a newspaper bought at the newsstand) but it is not always necessary for the party to literally grab the object for possession to be considered transferred. It is enough that the object is within the realm of factual control (e.g. leaving a letter in the letterbox). Sometimes it is enough for a symbol of the object which enables factual control to be handed over (e.g. handing over the keys to a car or a house). One may also choose to terminate possession, as one throws a letter in the trash. Possession includes having the opportunity to terminate possession.

In [[Mechanics lien]] law a ''Preliminary Notice'' (also known as a Notice to Owner, Materialmens Notice to Owner, Notice of Furnishing, Contractor/Subcontractors Notice to Owner, and others) is a notice sent by the [[general contractor]], [[subcontractor]], materialmen, equipment lessors or other parties to a construction project ''not'' to create a [[Mechanics lien]] but rather to establish the ''right to file a [[Mechanics lien]]'' in the event of nonpayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Notice FAQ by State|url=http://www.zlien.com/preliminary-notice/|website=zlien}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is important. If the Preliminary Notice is sent but the claimant's bill is paid, the Preliminary Notice has no further legal effect.  However, if the bill is not paid the claimant may now file a [[Mechanics lien]] on the owner's property.  Most states do not allow the filing of a [[Mechanics lien]] without claimants being able to prove they first sent a Preliminary Notice.

==Preliminary Notice Requirements==
In the United States, about forty states now require that some form of Preliminary Notice is sent to the owner and/or general contractor of a construction project in order to protect lien rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolfe, Jr.|first1=Scott|title=Is Preliminary Notice Required In My State? (List of Notice and Non-Notice States)|url=http://www.zlien.com/articles/is-preliminary-notice-required-in-my-state/|website=zlien}}&lt;/ref&gt; In states that require preliminary notices, several variables can affect Preliminary Notice requirements. These factors include contract type (whether the lien claimant is contracted directly with the owner or with a third party such as the general contractor), contract value (some preliminary notices are only required when the contract is above a certain dollar amount), and project type (sometimes specific rules apply to construction on condominiums and other structures with multiple owners).

Some states require that Preliminary Notices contain specific language. This information is generally specified in the lien statute of that state. If the Preliminary Notice does not contain the proper information and wording necessitated by the statute, the notice may be invalid which can result in the forfeiture of lien rights. Most Preliminary Notice forms can be obtained from websites that provide free resources, and a few computer programs exist to handle the process on a nationwide basis.

While some states have no Preliminary Notice requirements at all and others only require Preliminary Notice from certain parties, it is generally beneficial for all parties to send preliminary notice. In addition to protecting lien rights, Preliminary Notices ensure that parties at the top of the payment chain are made aware of who is working for them on a project.

==Deadlines==

Deadlines to send preliminary notices vary by state. Generally notice is required to be sent within a set number of days from the date that labor or materials were first furnished on a project. Some states (Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee) require that Preliminary Notice be sent every month that payment is not received. Other states (Nevada and Colorado) require that lien claimants send more than one type of Preliminary Notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garfield|first1=Danny|title=8 States With the Toughest Lien Notice Laws|url=http://www.zlien.com/articles/8-states-with-toughest-lien-notice-laws/|website=zlien|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, sending Preliminary Notice late results in the forfeiture of lien rights. However, some states accept late Preliminary Notice. For example, California requires that the California Preliminary 20-Day Notice is sent within 20 days of first furnishing labor and/or materials on a project to fully protect lien rights. If a notice is sent late, it will apply to work done ''after'' the date of submission and work done in the ''20 days prior'' to the date of submission, but will not apply to any work done ''before'' the 20 days preceding submission.

==How to Send Preliminary Notice==

Most states specify acceptable mailing methods in their lien statute. For example, the Texas lien statute states: "If notice is sent by registered or certified mail, deposit or mailing of the notice in the United States mail in the form required constitutes compliance with the notice requirement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Mechanics Lien Statute|url=http://www.zlien.com/mechanics-lien/texas-lien-statute/#-53003-Notices|website=zlien|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, states require that Preliminary Notice is sent via registered or certified mail, sometimes with return receipt requested.

The '''Privacy Act''' ({{lang-fr|Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels}}) is Canadian federal legislation that came into effect on July 1, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://privcom.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_15_e.asp|title=Privacy Legislation in Canada|accessdate=2006-08-16}} or [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103035930/http://privcom.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_15_e.asp backup at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The act sets out rules for how institutions of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] must deal with [[data privacy|personal information of individuals]]. Some salient provisions of the legislation are as follows:

* A government institution may not collect personal information unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution (section 4).
* With some exceptions, when a government institution collects an individual's personal information from the individual, it must inform the individual of the purpose for which the information is being collected (section 5(2)).
* With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may be used only for the purpose for which the information was obtained or for a use consistent with that purpose, unless the individual consents (section 7).
* With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may not be disclosed, unless the individual consents (section 8).
* Every [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizen]] or [[permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]] has the right to be given access to personal information about the individual under the control of a government institution that is reasonably retrievable by the government institution, and request correction if the information is inaccurate (section 12).
* The [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] receives and investigates complaints, including complaints that an individual was denied access to his or her personal information held by a government institution (section 29).

==Case law==
An individual who has been refused access to personal information may ultimately apply to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] for a review of the matter, pursuant to section 41 of the Act. The Court may order the head of the government institution to disclose the information to the individual (sections 48 and 49). Decisions of the Federal Court on such matters may be appealed to the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and, if leave is granted, further appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. Some important court decision concerning the Privacy Act are:

* ''[[Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police)]]'', 2003 SCC 8 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110222145858/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2003/2003scc8/2003scc8.html] (considering the definition of "personal information" in section 3 of the Privacy Act)

Canada (Solicitor General)]]'', 2002 SCC 75 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080220215137/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc75/2002scc75.html] (holding that section 51(2)(a) of the Privacy Act is unconstitutional because it requires that the entire hearing of certain applications to Federal Court be held ''[[in camera]]'')
* ''[[Lavigne v. Canada (Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages)]]'', 2002 SCC 53 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110226140454/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc53/2002scc53.html] (holding that the Privacy Act is 'quasi-constitutional' legislation, and considering section 22(1)(b), the exemption for information the disclosure of which could be injurious to the conduct of lawful investigations)
* ''[[Privacy Act (Can.) (Re)]]'', 2001 SCC 89 [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002025532/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2001/2001scc89/2001scc89.html] (holding that the Privacy Act was not violated by a program whereby [[Canada Customs]] gave information about travellers to the [[unemployment benefit#Canada|Canada Employment Insurance Commission]], to identify those who received employment insurance benefits while outside Canada)

In [[United States criminal law]], '''probable cause''' is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal or the issuing of a [[search warrant]]. The principle behind the standard is to [[limited power|limit the power]] of authorities to perform random or abusive searches ([[unlawful search and seizure]]), and to promote lawful evidence gathering and procedural form during criminal arrest and prosecution. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/probable_cause|title=Probable Cause|last=Busby|first=John C|date=2009-09-17|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term comes from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]:

{{Quote|The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, ''but upon probable cause'', supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.}}

''Probable'' in this case may relate to statistical [[probability]] or to a general standard of common behavior and customs. The context of the word ''probable'' here is not exclusive to community standards, and could partially derive from its use in formal mathematical statistics as some have suggested;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hald |first=Anders |title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1990 |page=44 |isbn=0471502308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''but cf. probō, Latin etymology.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/probo#Latin|title=probō, Wiktionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. immigration proceedings, the “reason to believe” standard has been interpreted as equivalent to probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/198382907/Jose-Manuel-Isabel-Diaz-A205-500-422-BIA-Dec-30-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A common definition is "a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a [[Reasonable person|prudent and cautious person's]] belief that certain facts are [[probability|probably]] true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handler |first=J. G. |title=Ballentine's Law Dictionary |edition=Legal Assistant |year=1994 |location=Albany |publisher=Delmar |page=431 |isbn=0827348746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition, allowing for use of the term by citizens and/or the general public.

In the context of warrants, the ''Oxford Companion to American Law'' defines probable cause as "information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)". "Probable cause" is a stronger standard of evidence than a [[reasonable suspicion]], but weaker than what is required to secure a [[criminal conviction]]. Even [[hearsay]] can supply probable cause if it is from a reliable source or supported by other evidence, according to the ''[[Aguilar–Spinelli test]]''.

In ''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] defines probable cause as "where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', {{ussc|338|160|1949}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
[[File:Constitution of the United States WDL2708.jpg|thumb|Constitution of the United States]]
The use of probable cause in the United States and its integration in the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] has roots in [[English common law]] and the old saying that "a man's home is his castle". This is the idea that someone has the right to defend their "castle" or home from unwanted "attacks" or intrusion. In the 1600s, this saying started to apply legally to landowners to protect them from casual searches from government officials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=9780132457613|page=62|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1700s, the British use of the [[Writ of assistance|writs of assistance]] and general warrants, which allowed authorities to search wherever and whenever sometimes, without expiration date, in the American colonies were raised in several court cases. The first was in Massachusetts in 1761 when a customs agent submitted for a new writ of assistance and Boston merchants challenged its legality. In the case the lawyer for the merchants James Otis argued that writs of assistance violated the fundamentals of English Law and was unconstitutional. [[John Adams]], a lawyer at the time who later wrote the Massachusetts provision on which the Fourth Amendment heavily relied, was impacted by James Otis's argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780132457613|page=63|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case against general warrants was the English case [[Entick v Carrington|''Entick v. Carrington'']] (1765). In that case, [[Lord Camden]] the chief judge said that general warrants were not the same as specific warrants and that parliament or case law could not authorize general warrants. Along with these statements, Lord Camden also affirmed that the needs of the state were more important than the individuals rights. This upheld the ideology of the social contract while holding to idea that the government purpose was to protect the property of the people.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; He called for the government to seek reasonable means in order to search private property, as well as a cause.

==Probationers and parolees==
In early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from "probable cause" to "reasonable grounds"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griffin v. Wisconsin]]'', {{ussc|483|868|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "reasonable suspicion". Specifically, the degree of individualized suspicion required of a search was a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. The Supreme Court held:

{{quote|Although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term "probable cause," a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable&amp;nbsp;... When an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer's significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Knights]]'', {{ussc|534|112|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion is not even necessary:

{{quote|The [[California Legislature]] has concluded that, given the number of inmates the State paroles and its high recidivism rate, a requirement that searches be based on individualized suspicion would undermine the State's ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders. This conclusion makes eminent sense. Imposing a reasonable suspicion requirement, as urged by petitioner, would give parolees greater opportunity to anticipate searches and conceal criminality.}}

The court held that reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, is the [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Samson v. California]]'', {{ussc|547|843|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Fourth Amendment rights be extended to probationers and parolees, but such proposals have not gained traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |volume=39|publisher=Hastings L. J.|pages=449|date=1987–1988|title=Right of All the People to be Secure: Extending Fundamental Fourth Amendment Rights to Probationers and Parolees, The|author=Koshy, Sunny A.

It has been argued that the requirement that a police officer must have individualized suspicion before searching a parolee's person and home was long considered a foundational element of the Court's analysis of Fourth Amendment questions and that abandoning it in the name of crime prevention represents an unprecedented blow to individual liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=42|publisher=Harv.

==Use of trained drug dogs==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0703-023, Dresden, Rauschgiftspürhund im Einsatz.jpg|thumb|185px|Right|Officer training a drug dog]]
In the United States, use of a [[drug dog|trained dog]] to smell for narcotics has been ruled in several court cases as sufficient probable cause. A K-9 Sniff in a public area is not a search according to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1983 ''[[United States v. Place]]''. In this particular case, Place was in the New York Airport, and [[DEA]] agents took his luggage, even though he refused to have his bag searched. His luggage smelled of drugs, and the trained dog alerted the agents to this. Dogs alerting their officers provides enough probable cause for the officer to obtain a warrant. The DEA then procured a [[Search warrant|warrant]] and found a sizable amount of drugs in Place's luggage. It was not considered a search until after the warrant because a trained dog can sniff out the smell of narcotics, without having to open and look through the luggage.

The power of probable cause by K-9 units smelling for drugs is not limited to just airports, but even in schools, public parking lots, high crime neighborhood streets, mail, visitors in prisons, traffic stops, etc. If there is an incident where the dog alerts its officer, the probable cause from the dog is considered enough to conduct a search, as long as one of the exceptions to a warrant are present, such as [[plain view doctrine|plain view]], [[incident to arrest]], automobile, [[exigency]], or with a [[stop and frisk]]. During a traffic stop and checkpoint, it is legal for police to allow a drug dog to sniff the exterior of the car. This is legal as long as it does not cause the traffic stop to be any longer than it would have been without the dog. If the dog finds a scent, it is again a substitute for probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;Wallentine, Ken. "The Dog Day Traffic Stop - Basic Canine Search and Seizure." (2008). Web. 21 Oct. 2014. http://policek9.com/html/drugdog.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber surveillance==
Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], law enforcement officials do not need probable cause, in order to access communications records, credit cards, bank numbers and stored emails held by third parties. They only need reasonable suspicion that the information they are accessing is part of criminal activities.  Under this, officers are authorized for a court order to access the communication information.  Only certain information can be accessed under this act (such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, etc.). Probable cause is needed for more detailed information because law enforcement needs a warrant to access additional information.  Generally, law enforcement is not required to notify the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles. “The USA PATRIOT Act: A Legal Analysis”. (2002). Web. 30 Nov 2014. {{cite web |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206041849/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text of the Patriot Act limits the application of that statute to issues that clearly involve the national security of the United States. &lt;ref&gt;See the text of 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent to search==
{{main|Consent search}}

If voluntary consent is given and the individual giving the consent has authority over the search area, such as a car, house, business, etc. then a law enforcement officer does not need probable cause or even reasonable suspicion.  If the person does not give voluntary consent, then the officer needs probable cause, and in some cases, a search warrant may be required to search the premises.  Unless another exclusion to the fourth amendment of the US constitution occurs, when the person withdraws their consent for searching, the officer has to stop looking immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, Bryan R. “SEARCHING A VEHICLE WITHOUT A WARRANT” Web. 30 Nov 2014. https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/4th-amendment/searchingavehicle-consent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident investigation==
In the United States, the term probable cause is used in accident investigation to describe the conclusions reached by the investigating body as to the factor or factors which caused the accident.  This is primarily seen in reports on aircraft accidents, but the term is used for the conclusion of diverse types of transportation accidents investigated in the United States by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] or its predecessor, the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]].

==Related cases==
===In the United States===
*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', {{ussc|462|213|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lowered the threshold of probable cause by ruling that a "substantial chance" or "fair probability" of criminal activity could establish probable cause. A better-than-even chance is not required.
*The decision in ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established that "stop and frisks" (seizures)  may be made under [[reasonable suspicion]] if the officer believes a crime has been committed, is, or soon will be committed with a weapon concealed on such person.
*In ''[[United States v. Matlock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Matlock]]'', {{ussc|415|164|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court announced the "co-occupant consent rule" which permitted one resident to consent in the co-occupant's absence.  The case established that an officer who made a search with a reasonable belief that the search was consented to by a resident did not have to provide a probable cause for the search.
:However, in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', {{ussc|547|103|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled, thus replacing ''Matlock'', when officers are presented with a situation wherein two parties, each having authority to grant consent to search premises they share, but one objects over the other's consent, the officers must adhere to the wishes of the non-consenting party.

*''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', {{ussc|468|1214|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; set a special precedent for searches of students at school. The Court ruled that school officials act as state officers when conducting searches, and do not require probable cause to search students' belongings, only [[reasonable suspicion]].
*In ''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'', {{ussc|480|709|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court relied on ''T.L.O.'' to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to administrative searches of public employees' belongings or workplaces when conducted by supervisors seeking evidence of violations of workplace rules rather than criminal offenses.

== Probable cause hearings ==
{{See also|Evidentiary hearing}}
In the various states, a '''probable cause hearing''' is the preliminary [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] typically taking place before [[arraignment]] and before a serious crime goes to [[Trial (law)|trial]]. The [[judge]] is presented with the basis of the [[prosecution]]'s case, and the [[defendant]] is afforded full right of [[cross-examination]] and the right to be represented by [[Lawyer|legal counsel]]. If the prosecution cannot make a case of probable cause, the court must dismiss the case against the accused.

==Comparison with other countries==
===Sweden===
In the criminal code of some European countries, notably [[Sweden]], probable cause is a higher level of suspicion than "justifiable grounds" in a two level system of formal suspicion.  The latter refers only to the suspect being able to and sometimes having a motive to commit the crime and in some cases witness accounts, whereas probable cause generally requires a higher degree of physical evidence and allows for longer periods of detention before trial. See ''[[häktning]]''.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Powers of arrest without a warrant can be exercised by a constable who 'has reasonable grounds' to suspect that an individual is "about to commit an offence", or is "committing an offence"; in accordance with the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] and the partially repealed [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/110 Section 110, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24 Section 24, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "reasonable grounds for suspecting" is used throughout the law dealing with police powers.

====Scotland====
In Scotland the legal language for the provision of police powers pertaining to stopping, arresting and searching a person who "has committed or is committing an offence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/46/section/13 Section 13, Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; or in possession of an offensive article or article used in connection with an offence; is similar to as in England and Wales but is instead the powers are provided by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2005.

'''''Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd''''' is a 1998 judgment from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] regarding the priority of employees interests when a company declares bankruptcy. The judgment hinged on the interpretation of the [[Employment Standards Act]] and has been taken to mark the Supreme Court of Canada's adoption of the [[purposive approach]] to legislative interpretation. It has since been frequently cited in subsequent decisions of Canadian courts, nearly every time legislation is interpreted.

==Background==
Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. filed for bankruptcy; employees subsequently lost their jobs. The company paid all wages, salaries, commissions, and vacation pay through termination. The [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ministry of Labour for the Province of Ontario]] audited the company to ensure that no further payments were owed to former employees under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Proof of claim was submitted to a trustee, who subsequently disallowed the claim. According to the trustee, a company's bankruptcy does not constitute dismissal from employment; thus, the former employees of Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes gained no positive right to severance, termination or vacation pay under the ESA.

The case went before the [[Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)|Ontario Court (General Division)]] where the judge agreed with the Ministry of Labour and allowed the former employees to be paid. However, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] overturned the ruling and restored the Trustee's decision. The Ministry sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal judgment but discontinued its application. Following the discontinuance of the appeal, the Trustee paid a dividend to Rizzo's creditors, thereby leaving significantly less funds in the estate. Subsequently, the appellants, five former employees of Rizzo, moved to set aside the discontinuance, add themselves as parties to the proceedings, and requested and were granted an order granting them leave to appeal.

==Ruling==

In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court allowed the employees' appeal holding that they were entitled to the payments. While the plain language of the Act seemed to suggest that termination pay and severance pay were payable only when the employer terminates the employment, the Court held that the words of an Act must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

Iacobucci J. wrote:

[[Elmer Driedger]] in Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p.&amp;nbsp;87 he states

''Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.''

(Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd ''[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (2nd ed 1983), at p. 87'')

The Court of Appeal had failed to read the language of the Act in this broad manner the Supreme Court held. It noted that the purpose of the termination and severance pay provisions were to protect employees, to recognize their service and investment in the employer's enterprise and to cushion them against the adverse effects of economic dislocation. To hold that (more junior) employees terminated prior to bankruptcy would be entitled to termination and severance pay while (more senior) employees terminated upon bankruptcy  would be absurd, the Court held:

:The trial judge properly noted that, if the ESA termination and severance pay provisions do not apply in circumstances of bankruptcy, those employees “fortunate” enough to have been dismissed the day before a bankruptcy would be entitled to such payments, but those terminated on the day the bankruptcy becomes final would not be so entitled.  In my view, the absurdity of this consequence is particularly evident in a unionized workplace where seniority is a factor in determining the order of lay-off. The more senior the employee, the larger the investment he or she has made in the employer and the greater the entitlement to termination and severance pay. However, it is the more senior personnel who are likely to be employed up until the time of the bankruptcy and who would thereby lose their entitlements to these payments.

The Court also held that the legislative history of the termination and severance pay provisions and the other provisions in the ESA supported an interpretation that such benefits were payable to employees whose employment is terminated upon bankruptcy. The Court also ordered the Ministry of Labour to pay the employees' costs, since it had not provided the Court with any evidence as to the effort it made to notify or secure the consent of the Rizzo employees before it discontinued its application for leave to appeal to this Court on their behalf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">'''Richard Frethorne ''' was an [[indentured servant]] at [[Martin's Hundred]], [[Virginia]] in 1622-1623.  He is known as the author of letters detailing his miserable condition in Virginia.

==Life==
Frethorne was from the parish of [[St. Dunstan-in-the-East]] in [[London]], where his family received [[poor relief]].  In 1622 he was indentured by the parish and sent to Virginia as a servant, arriving in December on the ship ''Abigail.''&lt;ref&gt;Dahlberg, Sandra L.  2012 “Doe Not Forget Me”: Richard Frethorne, Indentured Servitude, and the English Poor Law of 1601.  In ''Early American Literature'' 47(1)1-30. pp.2-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Textual analysis of his letters suggests he may have been around twelve years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlberg, Sandra L.  2012 “Doe Not Forget Me”: Richard Frethorne, Indentured Servitude, and the English Poor Law of 1601.  In ''Early American Literature'' 47(1)1-30. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;   Frethorne became one of the indentured servants of William Harwood, the “governor” or leader of Martin’s Hundred.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Hume, Ivor    1979  First Look at a Lost Virginia Settlement.  In ''National Geographic'' 155(6)735-767. P.736&lt;/ref&gt;  In March and April following his arrival, he wrote several letters to his family and associates back in England, listing the miseries of his life in Virginia and begging them to pay off his indenture or, failing that, to send some food which he could then sell.  Richard Frethorne died sometime before February 16, 1624 (1623 [[Old Style]]), when his name (in this case spelled “Frethram”) appears on a list of the dead at Martin’s Hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Living and Dead in Virginia  |url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/jamestown/census/1623cens.txt|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters==
On March 5, 1623 (1622 Old Style) Frethorne wrote to Mr. Bateman, one of the [[vestrymen]] of his home parish, asking for his help.  He lists various hardships suffered in Virginia, including lack of sufficient food, lack of adequate clothing, and settlements ravaged by recent [[Indian massacre of 1622|native attack]].  He asks Bateman to free him (by paying off the indenture) or to send food, and refers to the biblical story of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and to the books of [[Jeremiah]] and  [[Ecclesiasticus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Myra Kingsbury|Kingsbury, Susan Myra]], ed.  1935 ''The Records of the Virginia Company of London'', volume IV.  United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March and beginning of April Frethorne wrote to his parents in three installments dated March 20, April 2, and April 3.  In these missives he goes into greater and more emotional detail about his lack of food and clothing and about illness in the colony and the threat of native attack.  He describes others in his situation as expressing the opinion that being limbless beggars in England would be preferable to their current circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, Susan Myra, ed.  1935 ''The Records of the Virginia Company of London'', volume IV.  United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. pp. 58-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Frethorne's letter has been cited as evidence that the reports in England that the colonies in Virginia that were being run as a model of justice and equity were incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Diamond, "From Organization to Society: Virginia in the Seventeenth Century," ''The American Journal of Sociology 63 (1958), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="93507">The '''right to be forgotten''' is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice both in the [[European Union]] (EU) and, since 2006, in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/technology/internet/20google.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|title=Google and Yahoo Win Appeal in Argentine Case|first=Vinod|last=Sreeharsha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El derecho al olvido en Internet se deberá aplicar también en la Capital Federal|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1736360-el-derecho-al-olvido-en-internet-se-debera-aplicar-tambien-en-la-capital-federal|website=lanacion.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue has arisen from desires of individuals to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically [[stigmatize]]d as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past."&lt;ref name="mantelero"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mantelero |first=Alessandro |title=The EU Proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation and the roots of the 'right to be forgotten' |journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2013.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231}}

There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten to the status of an international [[human rights|human right]] in respect to access to information, due in part to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right.&lt;ref name="fleischer"&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Fleischer |url=http://peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz/2011/03/foggy-thinking-about-right-to-oblivion.html |title=Peter Fleischer: Privacy...?: Foggy thinking about the Right to Oblivion |publisher=Peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to [[freedom of expression]], its interaction with the [[right to privacy]], and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the [[Internet]] through [[censorship]] and a [[historical revisionism (negationism)|rewriting of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tessa |last=Mayes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/mar/18/forgotten-online-european-union-law-internet |title=We have no right to be forgotten online |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favour of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as [[revenge porn]] sites appearing in [[search engine]] listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed many years ago. The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

==Conception and proposal==
Europe's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of "the right to be forgotten" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are "spent", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth|title=Explaining the 'right to be forgotten' – the newest cultural shibboleth|author=Charles Arthur|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2010 |title=Charte sur la publicité ciblée et la protection des internautes |trans-title=Code of Good Practice on Targeted Advertising and the Protection of Internet Users |publisher=Secrétariat d'Etat chargé de la Prospective et du Développement de l'économie numérique |url=http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/PrivacyLaw_Charte_publicite.pdf |format=PDF |language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term "right to be forgotten" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the "right to be forgotten" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' case.

In 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. EU Directive 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This is now considered a component of [[human rights law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitrou |first=Lilian |first2=Maria |last2=Karyda |title=EU's Data Protection Reform and the right to be forgotten—A legal response to a technological challenge? |work=5th International Conference of Information Law and Ethics |year=2012 |pages=29–30 |ssrn=2165245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new European Proposal for [[General Data Protection Regulation]] provides protection and exemption for companies listed as "media" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a "media" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a "data controller" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These "data controllers" are required under EU law to remove data that is "inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant", making this directive of global importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Current legal frameworks==
The right to be forgotten "reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them."&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;Weber, Rolf H. "The right to be forgotten." More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} It has been defined as "the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring."&lt;ref&gt;Pino, G. (2000). "The right to personal identity in Italian private law: Constitutional interpretation and judge-made rights". In: M. Van Hoecke; F. Ost (eds.). The harmonization of private law in Europe (pp. 225-237). Oxford: Hart Publishing. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos or photographs about themselves deleted from certain internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;
{{As of|2011}} there are few protections against the harm that incidents such as [[revenge porn]] sharing, or pictures uploaded due to poor judgement, can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Kashmir |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/06/revenge-porn-with-a-facebook-twist |title=Revenge Porn With A Facebook Twist |publisher=Forbes |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be forgotten is distinct from the [[right to privacy]], due to the distinction that the right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=L.

Limitations of application in a [[jurisdiction]] include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have "extra-territorial effects".&lt;ref&gt;(September 23, 2015)[http://en.yibada.com/articles/66331/20150922/expert-google-escape-french-law-right-forgotten.htm?exe=reporter Expert: Google Can Not Escape French Law on Right to Delist].

===European Union===
In Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to internet protection for individuals.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|233}} In 2012 the [[European Commission]] disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which includes specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and On the Free Movement of Such Data ([[General Data Protection Regulation]]). 2012/0011 (COD). Article 17. Right to be forgotten and To Erasure&lt;/ref&gt;

To exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. [[Google]]'s removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|title=How Google's New "Right To Be Forgotten" Form Works: An Explainer|date=30 May 2014|work=Search Engine Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing "the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know", deciding if the website is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed".&lt;ref name=Brindle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brindle|first1=Beth|title=How can Google forget you?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/how-can-google-forget-you.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions.&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|last2=Chaparro|first2=Enrique|title=How Google determined our right to be forgotten|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them "to shape interpretation to [their] own ends".&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro" /&gt; In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google, in an open letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on 'right to be forgotten'|website = The Guardian|last = Kiss|first = Jemima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Removal Request Under Data Protection Law in Europe|url=https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch|website=Google|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Danny|title=How Google's New 'Right to be Forgotten' Form Works: An Explainer|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=Search Engine Land|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be presented. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the person for whom the request is being made does in fact approve.
 
The form allows people to submit the name they would like search results removed for. However, it only allows for the submission of one name, which some view as one of its flaws.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; For example, if someone known as both "Lawrence Smith" and "Larry Smith" were to submit a form for the removal of search results for his name, he would only be allowed to indicate one of these names on the form.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; Many people view it as inconvenient and believe it is a problem that Google should be able to easily fix.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt;

If Google refuses a request to delink material, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|title = Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|website = The Guardian|last = Arthur|first = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2015, the British Data Protection Agency had treated 184 such complaints, and overturned Google's decision in about a quarter of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/14/ico_google_clash_right_to_be_forgotten/|title = 'Right to be forgotten' festers as ICO and Google come to blows|website = The Register|last = Martin|first = Alexander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Google objects to a Data Protection Agency decision, it can face legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/internet/article4438460.ece|title = Google could face legal action over 'right to be forgotten' rejections|website = The Times|last = Dean|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicised delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU [[Data Protection Directive]], since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available.&lt;ref name="whydoit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/04/google_peston_bbc_delisting_not_compliant_w_public_interest_law_says_expert/ |title=Google de-listing of BBC article 'broke UK and Euro public interest laws' - So WHY do it? |last1=Orlowski |first1=Andrew |date=4 July 2014 |website=www.theregister.co.uk |publisher=The Register |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/what-is-google-deleting-under-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-why|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=What is Google deleting under the 'right to be forgotten' - and why?

Google notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and the BBC and other news organizations have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/google-ordered-to-remove-links-to-stories-about-right-to-be-forgotten-removals|title = Google ordered to remove links to 'right to be forgotten' removal stories|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied with the request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/bbc-wrong-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Why the BBC is wrong to republish 'right to be forgotten' links|website = The Guardian|last = Powles|first = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/privacy-watchdog-takes-first-step-against-those-undermining-right-to-be-forgotten-46495|title = Privacy watchdog takes first step against those undermining right to be forgotten|website = The Conversation|last = Boiten|first = Eerke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2014, Google has removed 1,390,838 URLs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a gathering of which websites had the most amount of links removed, Facebook won with a total of 11,973 URLs removed. [[YouTube]] had 5,999 removed, [[Google Groups]] had 7,246 removed, and [[Twitter]] had 4,588 removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though Facebook had the largest number of deleted URLs, there were other received requests that were not granted deletion. While Google does evaluate millions of URLs that have been requested to be removed, the ultimate decision must be made by a human "because the variables, including public interest claims, needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, it is to be kept in mind that internet users can still find removed information somewhat easily, just not through European Google search engines.

In July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that "shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information – not criminals, politicians and public figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/google-accidentally-reveals-right-to-be-forgotten-requests|title = Google accidentally reveals data on 'right to be forgotten' requests|website = The Guardian|last = Tippmann|first = Sylvia|first2 = Julia|last2 = Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data leak caused serious social consequences for Google as the public expressed their outrage and fear over the information that was recently made public. Though only 5% of requests were made by criminals, politicians, and public figures, the content removed was what sparked the most fear.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one request for data removal was from a British doctor requesting to have 50 links removed on past botched medical procedures. Google agreed to remove three search results containing his personal information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public voiced their outrage stating that removing such information can be used for manipulation and could lead to innocent people making uninformed decisions. Google responded to the public outrage by saying that when removing content they consider both the right of the individual and public interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The European Union has been pushing for the delinkings requested by EU citizens to be implemented by Google not just in European versions of Google (as in google.co.uk, google.fr, etc.), but on google.com and other international subdomains. Regulators want delinkings to be implemented so that the law cannot be circumvented in any way. Google has refused the French Data Protection Agency's demand to apply the right internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/google-rejects-france-expand-right-to-be-forgotten-worldwide|title = Google says non to French demand to expand right to be forgotten worldwide|website = The Guardian|last = Hern|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to their refusal to comply with the recommendation of the privacy regulating board Google has become the subject of a four-year-long antitrust investigation by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/eu-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-applied-globally/|title=EU wants 'right to be forgotten' applied globally|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the French Data Protection Agency dismissed Google's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/french-google-right-to-be-forgotten-appeal|title = French data regulator rejects Google's right-to-be-forgotten appeal|date = 21 September 2015|accessdate = 23 September 2015|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2015, the most delinked site is ''www.facebook.com''.

On December 15, 2009, the German [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] (Bundesgerichtshof) in [[Karlsruhe]] ruled that German websites do not have to check their archives in order to provide permanent protection of personality rights for convicted criminals. The case occurred after the names of the brothers were found on the website of [[Deutschlandradio]], in an archive article dating from July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vor 10 Jahren – Walter Sedlmayr ermordet|language=German|work=[[Deutschlandradio]]|date= 14 July 2000|url= http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/kalender/127148/|accessdate = 2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge Gregor Galke stated "This is not a blank check", and pointed out that the right to rehabilitation of offenders had been taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Namen der Sedlmayr-Mörder bleiben online|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/computer/410/497712/text/|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=avs/dpa |title=BGH-Urteil – Keine ständige Kontrolle von Online-Archiven |url=http://www.focus.de/digital/internet/bgh-urteil-keine-staendige-kontrolle-von-online-archiven_aid_463464.html |publisher=Focus |language=German|date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Argentina has seen law suits by [[celebrities]] against [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!]] in which the plaintiffs demand the removal of certain search results, and require removal of links to photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infotechnology.com/internet/La-Justicia-argentina-sobreseyo-a-Adriana-Norea-presidente-de-Google.hmtl-20120604-0005.html |title=La Justicia Argentina Sobreseyó a Adriana Noreña, Directora General de Google |publisher=Infotechnology.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case, brought by artist [[Virginia da Cunha]], involved photographs which had originally been taken with her permission and uploaded with her permission, however she alleged that the search results improperly associated her photographs with pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Edward L. "Argentina's Right to Be Forgotten." Emory International Law Review. 27 (2013): pg 23.&lt;/ref&gt; De Cunha's case achieved initial success resulting in Argentine search engines not showing images of the particular celebrity, however this decision is on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/139989/ |title='Search engines not responsible for content' |publisher=BuenosAiresHerald.com |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Simari, the judge in favor of De Cunha, stated that people have the right to control their image and avert others from "capturing, reproducing, broadcasting, or publishing one's image without permission."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-27/issue-1/recent-developments/argentinas-right-to-be-forgotten.html|title=Argentina's Right to be Forgotten|last=Carter|first=Edward|date=|website=Emory International Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Simari used a treatise written by Julio César Rivera, a Buenos Aires lawyer, author, and law professor  "the right to control one's personal data includes the right to prevent others from using one's image."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; Since the 1990s Argentina has also been a part of the habeas data movement in which they "adopted a constitutional provision that is part freedom-of-government-information law and part data privacy law."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; However, their version is known as amparo. Article 43&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; explains the version:

"Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or databases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;

Argentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called 'the most complete' because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential.

===United States===
Consideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in ''Melvin v. Reid'', and in ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931); Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Melvin v. Reid'' (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film ''[[The Red Kimono]]'' revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Red {{sic|Kimono}}: The Saga of Gabriel Darley Melvin |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir |title=Guarding Life's Dark Secrets: Legal and Social Controls over Reputation, Propriety, and Privacy |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |edition= |year=2007 |pages=217–225 |isbn=978-0-8047-5739-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court reasoned that "any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931) at 852-853&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.'' (1940), the plaintiff, [[William James Sidis]], was a former [[child prodigy]] who wished to spend his adult life quietly, without recognition; however, this was disrupted by an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The court held here that there were limits to the right to control one's life and facts about oneself, and held that there is social value in published facts, and that a person cannot ignore their celebrity status merely because they want to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression, or will constitute [[censorship]], thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendel |first=John |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-journalists-shouldnt-fear-europes-right-to-be-forgotten/251955/ |title=Why Journalists Shouldn't Fear Europe's 'Right to be Forgotten' |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, Robert K.

In a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that "many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy – even some guaranteed by law – have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances." Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the "right to be forgotten", noted that existing laws that require adverse information to be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allow the sealing or expunging of criminals records, are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/06/02/your-privacy-is-now-at-risk-from-search-engines-even-if-the-law-says-otherwise/ |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |title=Your Privacy Is Now At Risk From Search Engines -- Even If The Law Says Otherwise |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2015, [[Intelligence Squared|Intelligence Squared US]], an organization that stages [[Debate#Oxford-style debating|Oxford-Style debates]], held an event centered on the question, "Should the U.S. adopt the 'Right to be Forgotten' online?" The side against the motion won with a 56% majority of the voting audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1252-the-u-s-should-adopt-the-right-to-be-forgotten-online|title=The U.S. Should Adopt the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Online|work=intelligencesquaredus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While opinions among experts are divided in the U.S., one survey indicated that 9 in 10 Americans want some form of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/prnewser/hey-google-9-in-10-americans-want-the-right-to-be-forgotten/111218|title = Hey Google: 9 in 10 Americans Want the 'Right to Be Forgotten'|website = Adweek|last = Coffee|first = Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer rights organization [[Consumer Watchdog]] has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for Americans to obtain the right as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/consumer-watchdog-google-should-extend-right-be-forgotten-u-s-n388131|title = Consumer Watchdog: Google Should Extend 'Right To Be Forgotten' to U.S.|website = NBC News|last = Eng|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[State of New York|New York]] state senator [[Tony Avella]] and assemblyman [[David Weprin]] introduced a bill proposing that individuals be allowed to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is "inaccurate", "irrelevant", "inadequate", or "excessive", that is "no longer material to current public debate or discourse" and is causing demonstrable harm to the subject.&lt;ref name="wp-nybill"&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y. bill would require people to remove 'inaccurate,' 'irrelevant,' 'inadequate' or 'excessive' statements about others|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/03/15/n-y-bill-would-require-people-to-remove-inaccurate-irrelevant-inadequate-or-excessive-statements-about-others/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In April 2016, the [[Delhi High Court]] began to examine the issue after a Delhi banker requested to have his personal details removed from search results following a marital dispute.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Delhi-banker-seeks-right-to-be-forgotten-online/articleshow/52060003.cms|title=Delhi banker seeks 'right to be forgotten' online - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, due to the dispute being settled, the banker's request is valid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The High Court has asked for a reply from Google and other search engine companies by September 19, upon which the court will continue to investigate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catchnews.com/tech-news/what-is-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-how-it-will-affect-you-1462532182.html|title=What is the Right to be Forgotten and how it could affect you?|website=CatchNews.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the [[Karnataka High Court]] upheld the right to be forgotten, in a case involving a woman who originally went to court in order to get a marriage certificate annulled, claiming to have never been married to the man on the certificate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livelaw.in/first-indian-court-upholds-right-forgotten-read-order/|title=In A First An Indian Court Upholds The 'Right To Be Forgotten' [Read Order] {{!}} Live Law|date=2017-02-03|work=Live Law|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the two parties came to an agreement, the woman's father wanted her name to be removed from search engines regarding criminal cases in the high court.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Karnataka High Court approved the father's request, stating that she had a right to be forgotten. According to the court, its ruling would align with western countries' decisions, which typically approve of the right to be forgotten when dealing with cases "involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The woman in this specific case was worried that the search results would affect her standing with her husband, as well as her reputation in society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/right-to-be-forgotten-how-a-prudent-karnataka-hc-judgment-could-pave-the-way-for-privacy-laws-in-india-3270938.html|title=Right to be forgotten: How a prudent Karnataka HC judgment could pave the way for privacy laws in India|date=2017-02-07|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India.

=== South Korea ===
In May 2016, [[Korea Communications Commission|South Korea's Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC) announced citizens will be able to request search engines and website administrators to restrict their own postings from being publicly accessible.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|website=www.bna.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KCC released "[http://src.bna.com/eBy Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings]", which will take effect in June 2016, which will not apply to third party contents.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  To the extent that the right to be forgotten concerns a data subject's right to limit the searchability of third party postings about him/her, the Guideline does not constitute a right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/736858.html|title=방통위, '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인' 제정|date=2016-03-25|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as to the right to withdraw one's own posting, critics have noted that people have been able to delete their own postings before the Guideline as long as they have retained their login credentials, and that people who have misplaced their login credentials were permitted to retrieve or receive new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byline.network/2016/04/1-94/|title=[심재석의 입장] 방통위의 이상한 '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인'|last=심재석|date=2016-04-01|website=BYLINE NETWORK|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only services significantly affected by the Guideline are Wiki-type services where people's contributions make logical sense only in response to or in conjunction with one another's contributions and therefore the postings are made permanent part of the mass-created content, but KCC made sure that the Guideline applies to these services only when the posting identifies the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/06/29/2016062902224.html|title='네이버 지식iN' 질문 글, 개인정보 남아 있을 때만 '잊혀질 권리' 적용|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines created by the KCC include that data subjects can remove content that includes the URL links, and any evidence consisting of personal information. The commission included different amendments to the guideline. This includes describing the Guidelines as a "minimum" and "preliminary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|last=Lim|first=James|date=|website=Bloomberg BNA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; precaution regarding privacy rights in vague areas of existing laws. The guideline encompasses foreign Internet companies that provide translation services for South Korean consumers. In order to have a person's information "forgotten" he or she has to go through a three step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/561018/IT+internet/Korea+Communications+Commission+Releases+Guidelines+On+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten|title=Korea Communications Commission Releases Guidelines On "The Right to Be Forgotten"|last=Yulchon LLC|first=|date=|website=Mondaq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue posted with the URL, proof of ownership of the post, grounds for the request. There are restrictions on each step. When posting the URL, the web operator has the right to preserve the posting issue. The second being that if the post is relevant to public interest, web operators will process this request on the terms of relevance.

=== China ===
In May 2016, Chinese courts in Beijing determined citizens do not have the right to be forgotten when a judge ruled in favor of [[Baidu]] in a lawsuit over removing search results.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/chinese-have-no-right-be-forgotten-court-rules|title=Chinese Have No Right to Be Forgotten, Court Rules|last=Tone|first=Sixth|date=2016-05-05|website=Sixth Tone|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of such cases to be heard in Chinese court.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the suit, Ren Jiayu sued Chinese search engine Baidu over search results that associated him with a previous employer, Wuxi Taoshi Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ren argued that by posting the search results, Baidu had infringed upon his right of name and right of reputation, both protected under Chinese law.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of these protections, Ren believed he had a right to be forgotten by removing these search results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The court ruled against Ren, claiming his name is a collection of common characters and as a result the search results were derived from relevant words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

China has one of the longest histories as an entire nation, being over 2000 years of feudal society; their civil laws and personal rights have not been altered through legislative efforts. Nowhere in the country's civil agreement does it discuss the concept of "privacy", more specifically internet privacy, and the growing issue that citizens, "have the right to be forgotten" on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/research/publications/vuwlr/prev-issues/pdf/vol-36-2005/issue-3/jingchun.pdf|title=Protecting the Right to Privacy in China|last=Jingchun|first=Cao|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no data protection authority or a specific state agency set in place to monitor the protection of citizens personal data. In China today, data protection is aimed at simply the consumer, as an individual. In contrast to the EU's right to privacy, which the individual is considered a "data subject", with the right to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese legislation remains neutral, with slow progression towards the support of the "right to be forgotten". The topic has been debated for more than 10 years now, and continues to be a challenge. Small provisions have been implemented related to personal data processing, however they do not amount to a comprehensive data protection regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no solid, common ground to be found on two fundamentally different systems: realistic, to Chinese laws that are already in place, and legalist, the steps it takes to change those laws, approaches that elicit a need for reification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to international relations==
The regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian international system]] assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobrin | first1 = Stephen J. | year = 2004 | title = Safe harbours are hard to find: the trans-Atlantic data privacy dispute, territorial jurisdiction and global governance | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1017/S0260210504005856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/&gt; Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/&gt;

The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the "third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection," meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to "opt out" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 

Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous [[digital privacy]] regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to "opt out" and afford other protections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Under the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European_Court_of_Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US_Privacy_Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].

The European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a "Privacy Bill of Rights" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/fact-sheet-plan-protect-privacy-internet-age-adopting-consumer-privacy-b |title=Fact Sheet: Plan to Protect Privacy in the Internet Age by Adopting a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft General Data Protection Regulation was written broadly and this has caused concern.&lt;ref name="fleischer"/&gt; It has attracted criticism that its enactment would require data controlling companies to go to great lengths to identify third parties with the information and remove it.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/right-to-be-forgotten |title=The Right to Be Forgotten |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Stanford Law Review |volume=64 |issue=88 |date= February 13, 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed regulation has also attracted criticism due to the fact that this could produce a censoring effect in that companies, such as Facebook or Google, will wish to not be fined under the act, and will therefore be likely to delete wholesale information rather than facing the fine, which could produce a "serious chilling effect."&lt;ref name=" stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; In addition to this, there are concerns about the requirement to take down information that others have posted about an individual; the definition of personal data in Article 4(2) includes "any information relating to" the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011 |title=Document 52012PC0011 — Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |at=3.4.1.

There were concerns that the proposed General Data Protection Regulation would result in [[Google]] and other Internet search engines not producing neutral search results, but rather producing biased and patchy results, and compromising the [[integrity]] of Internet-based information.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; To balance out this criticism, the proposed General Data Protection Regulation included an exception "for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the rules governing freedom of expression."&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; Article 80 upheld freedom of speech, and while not lessening obligations on data providers and social media sites, nevertheless due to the wide meaning of "journalistic purposes" allows more autonomy and reduces the amount of information that is necessary to be removed.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|9}} When Google agreed to implement the ruling, European Commission Vice-President [[Viviane Reding]] said, "The Court also made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/140602_en.htm | title='Right to be forgotten' and online search engines ruling | publisher=European Commission | date=2014-06-03 | accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google was criticized for taking down (under the Costeja precedent) a BBC News blog post about [[Stan O'Neal]] by economics editor [[Robert Peston]] (eventually, Peston reported that his blog post has remained findable in Google after all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28130581 | title=Why has Google cast me into oblivion? | work=BBC News | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Peston, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/the_right_to_be_forgotten_is_already_messing_up_journalism_20140702 | title=The 'Right to Be Forgotten' Is Already Messing Up Journalism | work=Truthdig | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Scheer, Peter Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these criticisms and Google's action, the company's CEO, [[Larry Page]] worries that the ruling will be "used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things", though has since distanced himself from that position.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/24/google-hauled-in-by-europe-over-right-to-be-forgotten-reaction|title=Google hauled in by Europe over 'right to be forgotten' reaction|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, pianist [[Dejan Lazic]] cited the ''Right To Be Forgotten'' in trying to remove a negative review about his performance from ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

Other criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors.

"A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the [[European Court of Justice]] regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law.{{fact|date=February 2018}} However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life.

[[Theresa May]], the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-12/may-tells-facebook-to-offer-kids-right-to-delete-information|title=May Tells Facebook to Offer Kids the Right to Delete Information|date=2017-05-12|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; May gave her stance on privacy when she said, "'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

CNIL asked [[Google]] to remove data from all versions available in any part of the world. Google and other entities argued that European data regulators should not be allowed to decide what Internet users around the world find when they use a search engine.&lt;ref&gt; [https://previewtech.net/right-to-be-forgotten-globally-google-cnil-france/ France tries to impose ‘Right to be Forgotten’ globally.

In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.

In the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to "name, age, and nationality."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an "ownership token"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this "ownership token" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.

Researchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own "whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The '''Royal Commission on the Constitution''', also referred to as the '''Kilbrandon Commission''' (initially the '''Crowther Commission''') or '''Kilbrandon Report''', was a long-running [[royal commission]] set up by [[Harold Wilson]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to examine the structures of the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Islands]] and the government of [[countries of the United Kingdom|its constituent countries]], and to consider whether any changes should be made to those structures. It was started under [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Lord Crowther]] on 15 April 1969, [[Charles Shaw, Baron Kilbrandon|Lord Kilbrandon]] took over in 1972, and it finally reported on 31 October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969 – 1973'', Volume I, Report (Cmnd 5460)&lt;/ref&gt;

Various models of [[devolution]], [[federalism]] and [[Confederation|confederalism]] were considered, as well as the prospect of the division of the UK into separate [[sovereign states]]. [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] were dealt with separately from the core issue of [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].

A total of 16 volumes of evidence and 10 research papers were published between 1969 and 1973. The final report was delivered to [[Edward Heath]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Conservative Government 1970–1974|Government]], which had come to power at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|general election in June 1970]]. The report rejected the options of independence or [[federalism]], in favour of devolved, directly elected [[Scottish Assembly|Scottish]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Welsh]] [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]]. Two members of the Commission, [[Norman Crowther Hunt, Baron Crowther-Hunt|Lord Crowther-Hunt]] and [[Professor Alan Peacock]], did not sign the report, disagreeing with the interpretation of the terms of reference and the conclusions. Their views were published in a separate Memorandum of Dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref14465.html | title=Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969–73: volume II: memorandum of dissent by Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor A.T.

==Background==
The royal commission was set up in response to growing demands for [[home rule]] or full independence for [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], which came into public focus after the ground-breaking [[UK by-elections|by-election]] wins of [[Plaid Cymru]]'s [[Gwynfor Evans]] at the [[Carmarthen by-election, 1966]], and the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[Winnie Ewing]] in [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|Hamilton in 1967]].

==Terms of reference==
The Commission's terms of reference were:
* To examine the present functions of the present legislature and government in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom;
* To consider, having regard to changes in local government organisation and in the administrative and other relationships between the various parts of the United Kingdom, and to the interests of the prosperity and good government and our people under the Crown, whether any changes are desirable in those functions or otherwise in present constitutional and economic relationships;
* To consider also whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships between the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name=timespw&gt;Political will for separation "does not exist", ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==Proposals==
The commission was unable to reach unanimous agreement, with the final report including a number of options supported by different members. Two commissioners did not sign the report, producing instead a ''memorandum of dissent''.

===Scotland===
{{main article|Scottish Assembly}}
Eight members favoured a [[Scottish Assembly|devolved legislature]] for [[Scotland]]. Executive power would be exercised by ministers appointed by the Crown from members of a directly elected assembly. Areas of responsibility to be transferred to the devolved body would be some of those already under the supervision of the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] and the [[Lord Advocate]]. These included:
*Education
*The environment
*Health
*Home affairs
*Legal matters
*Social services

Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would retain control of electricity supply.

With the establishment of the devolved government, it was proposed that the number of [[member of parliament|MPs]] elected to [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Westminster from Scottish constituencies]] would be reduced from 71 to about 51.

The assembly was to be a single chamber body of about 100 members, elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]], with multi-member constituencies. The Commission did not propose to give the assembly a name, feeling this was a matter for the Scottish people, although the term "convention" had been suggested. The determination of the number of seats and boundaries was to be reserved to the [[United Kingdom parliament]].

The new constitutional arrangements would not require the appointment of a governor, while the title "Scottish Premier" was suggested for the head of the executive.

The [[office of Secretary of State for Scotland]] would be abolished, although a [[cabinet minister]] would continue to have special responsibility in representing Scotland as well as having other duties.&lt;ref name="timeskil"&gt;Kilbrandon Report, ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
Six commissioners favoured legislative devolution for Wales. This would be similar to the scheme envisaged for Scotland, but with less responsibility in legal affairs, reflecting that Scotland had a discrete legal system separate from England and Wales.

As in Scotland, a 100-member unicameral assembly was proposed, elected by proportional representation. A title suggested to the commission for the body was "Senate". Similarly, the head of the executive might be titled "Welsh Premier", and the office of [[Secretary of State for Wales]] would be abolished. The number of Westminster MPs elected by Welsh constituencies would be reduced from 36 to about 31.&lt;ref name="timeskil"/&gt;

===England===
The signatories to the main report were unanimous in their opposition of legislative devolution to England as a whole, or to any English region. There were however proposals for some powers being devolved to regional level:
*Eight members supported the idea of non-executive co-ordinating and advisory councils to make representations and give advice to central government on government policy effecting the regions. Each council was to have about 60 members, the majority elected by local authorities in the region with about 20% nominated by the minister responsible for regional affairs to represent industry, agriculture, commerce, trade unions, and statutory promotional bodies in the region.
*Two members favoured the establishment of regional assemblies with executive powers, elected in a similar manner to those in Scotland and Wales.

In each case the regions to be used were to be those already established for economic planning, with boundaries adjusted to reflect the changes made by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], although names were not suggested:
#[[Cleveland (county)|Cleveland]], Cumbria, [[County Durham|Durham]], Northumberland, [[Tyne and Wear]]
#[[Humberside]], North Yorkshire, [[South Yorkshire]], West Yorkshire
#[[Cheshire]], Greater Manchester, [[Merseyside]], Lancashire
#[[Derbyshire]], Leicestershire, [[Lincolnshire]], Northamptonshire, [[Nottinghamshire]]
#[[Hereford and Worcester]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], Staffordshire, [[Warwickshire]], West Midlands
#[[Cambridgeshire]], Norfolk, [[Suffolk]]
#[[Avon (county)|Avon]], Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Gloucestershire]], Somerset, [[Wiltshire]]
#[[Bedfordshire]], Berkshire, [[Buckinghamshire]], East Sussex, [[Essex]], Greater London, [[Hampshire]], Hertfordshire, [[Isle of Wight]], Kent, [[Oxfordshire]], Surrey, [[West Sussex]]

====Cornwall====
The Commission recognised that "a very small minority" in [[Cornwall]] existed that claimed a separate national identity for the [[Cornish people]], and who wished to have separate arrangements for their government. They however felt that "despite its individual character and strong sense of regional identity, there is no evidence that its people have a wish to see it separated for the purposes of government from the rest of England". However they recognised that "the people of Cornwall regard their part of the United Kingdom as not just another English county" and accordingly they recommended that the designation "Duchy of Cornwall" be used on all appropriate occasions to emphasise the "special relationship and the territorial integrity of Cornwall".&lt;ref name="timeskil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmodpm/977/977we20.htm Kilbrandon Report paragraph 329 Quoted in Memorandum by the National Executive Committee of Mebyon Kernow, the Party for Cornwall (Written Evidence given to the Select Committee on Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
The Commission did not make any recommendations on devolution in [[Northern Ireland]], for which the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] had made provision. However, the report did recommend that the number of Westminster MPs from the province be increased in line with the rest of the UK, from 12 to about 17.

===Channel Islands and the Isle of Man===
The Commission did not propose to make any changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. They rejected a suggestion that responsibilities for external affairs be divided between the UK and island governments, but supported a [[Home Office]] proposal that a more formal process of consultation be carried out in future over the application of international agreements in the islands.

==Memorandum of dissent==
Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor Peacock did not sign the report, producing a separate series of proposals in a minority memorandum. The main differences between the document and the main report were:

===Regional assemblies===
There would be seven elected regional assemblies, one for Scotland, one for Wales and five [[Regional Assemblies in England]]. They would have considerably greater powers than proposed in the majority report, taking over much of the [[machinery of central government]] within their area, and each having their own civil service. They would also replace ad hoc authorities such as regional health authorities and water authorities, which were due to be introduced in reorganisation of the [[National Health Service]] and water industry. They would also have supervisory powers over gas and electricity boards. They would also be able to make policy through strategic plans for the physical, social and economic development of their regions.

A Minister for the Regions would hold a cabinet seat.

===Commons reform===
The memorandum also suggested changes in the function of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]]. Members of parliament were to form "functional committees" corresponding to central government departments. Each committee was to have a supporting staff and would consider the implications of both United Kingdom and European legislation, as well as having policy-making powers. To reflect their greater responsibilities, MPs would be paid full-time professional salaries.

==Political reaction==
There was mixed reaction to the Commission's report:
*The chairman of [[Plaid Cymru]] regarded it as a "real breakthrough", and called for the government to provide a commitment to introduce a Welsh government with legislative power. However, they called for the assembly to have additional powers over economic and industrial planning.
*[[Winifred Ewing]], vice-chairman of the [[Scottish National Party]], described it as a "step in the right direction", and that the proposed [[Scottish assembly]] "would lead to the self-government the SNP sought".
*The secretary of the Welsh Labour Party welcomed the introduction of an assembly, but opposed the reduction in the number of Westminster MPs.
*The leader of the Welsh Liberal Party believed it to be a "major breakthrough" which would lead to proportional representation being introduced in Westminster.
*An official of the Welsh Conservative Party called for people not to be "over-influenced by the vocal minority, which includes extremists and nationalist fanatics."
*The chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party expressed doubts about the reduction in the number of MPs.
*The secretary of [[Mebyon Kernow]], while noting that their proposal for a Cornish Regional Council had been rejected, said they were encouraged by the establishment of assemblies in Scotland and Wales, and the emphasis on the "Duchy of Cornwall".&lt;ref&gt;Generally favourable response among Welsh and Scots political leaders, ''The Times'', 1 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Following a change of government at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 election]], the new Labour administration published a [[white paper]] ''[[Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales]]'' based on the final report in September 1974. The white paper led directly to the unsuccessful [[Scotland and Wales Bill]], which was withdrawn in February 1977. Two separate pieces of legislation were passed in the following year: the [[Scotland Act 1978]] and the [[Wales Act 1978]]. The provisions of the Acts would not come into force unless approved by [[referendum]]s, and accordingly [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish]] and [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh]] devolution referendums were held on 1 March 1979. The Welsh assembly was rejected by a majority of voters, while Scottish devolution was supported by 51.6% of those voting, or 32.9% of those on the electoral register. An amendment to the Scotland Act, introduced by government backbencher [[George Cunningham (MP)|George Cunningham]], had specified that it must have the support of 40% of the entire electorate, and the referendum was lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/306859.stm ''Breaking up is hard to do'', BBC News, retrieved August 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the referendums led to the [[repeal]] of the respective Acts in March 1979. A vote of no confidence was subsequently lost by the government on 28 March when the Scottish National Party voted with the Conservatives, Liberals and Ulster Unionist Party, leading to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election of 1979]] and the beginning of 18 years of Conservative rule.

Scottish and Welsh devolution was finally implemented under the next Labour government, elected in 1997, by the [[Scotland Act 1998]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]].

The '''second-parent adoption''' or '''co-parent adoption''' is a process by which a marriage partner can [[Adoption|adopt]] her or his partner's biological or adoptive child without terminating the first legal parent's rights. This issue is of significant importance in the context of the [[LGBT adoption]].

In the United States, second-parent adoption was started by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] (formerly the Lesbian Rights Project) in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nclrights.org/publications/adptn0204.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[California]] (2003 &lt;ref&gt;''Sharon S. v.

Snyder|was struck down]] by the [[Supreme Court]] in 2015. 

Courts in many other states have also granted second-parent adoptions to same-sex couples, though there is no statewide law or court decision that guarantees this.  In fact, courts within the same state but in different jurisdictions often contradict each other in practice. {{cn|date=December 2017}}

The [[American Medical Association]]  supported second parent adoption by same-sex partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.shtml|title=H-60.940 Partner Co-Adoption, H-65.973 Health Care Disparities in Same-Sex Partner Households "AMA Policy regarding sexual orientation"|publisher=Ama-assn.org|accessdate=16 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019042918/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|archivedate=19 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that lack of formal recognition can cause health-care disparities for children of same-sex parents.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In July 2011, The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs of [[Slovenia]] stated that the existing law allows for [[second-parent adoption]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policy.hu/takacs/pdf-lib/Confronting_Homophobia_in_Europe-the_book.pdf |title=Confronting Homophobia in Europe |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/first-adoption-by-gay-partner-of-child-s-parent|title=First Adoption by Gay Partner of Child's Parent|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sloveniatimes.com|language=|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[LGBT adoption and parenting in Australia]], {{as of|2008}}, the best option was to apply to the [[Family Court of Australia]] for a parenting order, as ‘other people significant to the care, welfare and development’ of the child. It provides an important "status quo" if the birth mother were to die, preventing other family members from taking immediate custody of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Same Sex, Same Entitlements |publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/human_rights/samesex/report/Ch_5.html |accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is second parent adoption possible in Australia? |publisher=Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Lobby |url=http://www.glrl.org.au/issues/relationship_qa.htm#Q4_1 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719183625/http://www.glrl.org.au/issues/relationship_qa.htm%23Q4_1 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Trust law]]''' is not part of most '''[[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]]''', but is a common figure in most [[common law]] system (and thus in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions). Trust law enters civilian jurisdictions through [[Conflict of laws|conflict of law]] arrangements recognizing it as a matter of [[private international law]] and has been implemented in the [[civil code]] of certain countries such as [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Curaçao]].

==Conflict of laws==
Sometimes, in a civil law jurisdiction, a foreign trust is involved. This recognition often involves "translating" the trust's characteristics into legal concepts that do exist within the civil law country. With the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community, the trust entered [[Community Law]]; the law of the member state where the trust is constituted (the ''situs'') is designated as the applicable law (the law that must be followed) in member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch|url=http://www.verenigingvoorburgerlijkrecht.nl/pdf_files/preadviezen/1994%20Boeschoten_Vriesendorp_Trust.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012|author=C.D. van Boeschoten|work=vereniging voor burgerlijk recht|title=het Haags trustverdrag in Nederlands persectief}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain trusts must be recognized by parties to the [[Hague Trust Convention]] (amongst which the civil law countries Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) if they are following certain requirements: the trust must be an [[express trust]] reduced to writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=59|title=Status Table: 30: Convention of 1 July 1985 on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|accessdate=14 September 2012|work=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curaçao,Sint Maarten and Liechtenstein==
The [[Curaçao trust]] and [[Sint Maarten trust]] exist since 1 January 2012 and 1 April 2014 respectively. They enable creation of trusts in the jurisdiction of Curaçao/Sint Maarten, when constituted by [[Civil law notary|notarial]] [[Act (document)|instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cifa-curacao.com/pdfdocuments/WPNR%202012-6926%20De%20Boer.pdf|title=De Curaçaose trust in de partijk|language=Dutch|author=M. Bergervoet and D.S.

The Liechtenstein trust requires a written agreement and registration on a trusts registry, which will not be publicly available if it is registered within 12 months. Later registrations require the registration in public record of the trustee's name, and certain details of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envisage.ch/other-services/company-trust-amp-foundation-formation/liechtenstein-trusts/|title=Liechtenstein trusts|accessdate=14 September 2012|work=Envisage Wealth Management Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''unitary executive theory''' is a theory of [[United States Constitution|American constitutional law]] holding that the [[President of the United States|President]] possesses the power to control the entire executive branch. The doctrine is rooted in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]], which vests "the executive power" of the United States in the President.

Although that general principle is widely accepted, there is disagreement about the strength and scope of the doctrine.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt; It can be said that some favor a "strongly unitary" executive, while others favor a "weakly unitary" executive.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt; The former group argue, for example, that [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s power to interfere with intra-executive decision-making (such as firing executive branch officials) is limited, and that the President can control policy-making by all executive agencies within the limits set for those agencies by Congress. Still others agree that the Constitution requires a unitary executive, but believe this to be harmful, and propose its abolition by [[Constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendment]].&lt;ref name="Berry" /&gt;

{{anchor|Plural executive}}'''Plural executives''' exist in several [[U.S. state|states]] where, in contrast to the federal government, executive officers such as [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]], [[State attorney general|attorney general]], [[comptroller#United States|comptroller]], [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], and others, are elected independently of the [[Governor (United States)|state's governor]], with [[Texas#State government|Texas]] being one example. This type of executive structure is known as a plural executive. Another type of plural executive, used in Japan, Israel, and Sweden, though not in any U.S. state, in which a collegial body comprises the executive branch – however, that collegial body does not comprise multiple members elected in elections, but is rather more akin to the [[U.S. Cabinet]] in formation and structure.

==Theory==
The [[Vesting Clause]] of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] provides, "The executive Power [of the United States] shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." Proponents of the unitary executive theory argue that this language, along with the [[Take Care Clause]] ("The President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed..."), creates a "hierarchical, unified executive department under the direct control of the President."&lt;ref name="plural"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Calabresi |first1= Steven |last2= Rhodes |first2= Kevin |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Structural Constitution: Unitary Executive, Plural Judiciary |journal= Harvard Law Review |year= 1992 |volume= 105 |issue= 6 |page= 1165 |doi=10.2307/1341727 |jstor= 1341727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general principle that the President controls the entire executive branch was originally rather innocuous, but extreme forms of the theory have developed.&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt; [[John Dean]] explains: "In its most extreme form, unitary executive theory can mean that neither Congress nor the federal courts can tell the President what to do or how to do it, particularly regarding national security matters."&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean |first= John |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dj56j5TsNUAC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22unitary+executive%22#PPA102,M1 |title= Broken Government |page= 102 |publisher= Viking |year= 2007|isbn= 9780670018208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to law professors [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Cass Sunstein]], "No one denies that in some sense the framers created a unitary executive; the question is in what sense. Let us distinguish between a strong and a weak version."&lt;ref name="Lessig"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lessig |first1= Lawrence |last2= Sunstein |first2= Cass |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.pegc.us/archive/Authorities/Lessig_Col_L_R_President.pdf |format= PDF |title= The President and the Administration |journal= [[Columbia Law Review]] |volume= 94 |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either its strong or weak form, the theory would limit the power of Congress to divest the President of control of the executive branch.  The "strongly unitary" theory posits stricter limits on Congress than the "weakly unitary" theory.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt;

Some scholars oppose even the "weakly unitary" theory and favor creating a plural executive, as in the many state governments that separately elect an attorney general.&lt;ref name="Berry"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Berry |first1= Christopher |last2= Gersen |first2= Jacob |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=nwwps |title= The Unbundled Executive |journal= University of Chicago Law Review |year= 2008 |quote= We certainly do not claim that the most sensible or even any plausible interpretation of the US Constitution establishes a plural unbundled executive; but perhaps it should |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807190941/http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=nwwps |archivedate= August 7, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those scholars acknowledge that a constitutional amendment would be required to eliminate the federal unitary executive.

Proponents of a strongly unitary theory argue that the president possesses ''all'' of the executive power and can therefore control subordinate officers and agencies of the executive branch. This implies that the power of Congress to remove executive agencies or officers from Presidential control is limited. Thus, under the strongly unitary executive theory, independent agencies and counsels are unconstitutional to the extent that they exercise discretionary executive power not controlled by the president.&lt;ref name="plural" /&gt;

The [[Federal government of the United States#Judicial branch|judicial branch]] implications are that a part of the executive branch cannot [[lawsuit|sue]] another part because "the executive cannot sue himself." If the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] were to adjudicate disputes between [[List of United States federal agencies|executive agencies]], it would violate the doctrine of [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Latham |first= Joshua |url= http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bcealr/27_3/04_FMS.htm |title= The Military Munitions Rule and Environmental Regulation of Munitions |journal= Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review |volume= 27 |page= 467 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption of constitutional provisions==
The phrase "unitary executive" was discussed as early as the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, referring mainly to having a single individual fill the office of President, as proposed in the [[Virginia Plan]]. The alternative was to have several executives or an executive council, as proposed in the [[New Jersey Plan]] and as promoted by [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Edmund Randolph]], and [[George Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Ralph |editor-last= Ketchum |title= The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates |publisher= Signet Classic |year= 1986 |page= 67 |quote= Mr. [James] Wilson entered into a contrast of the principal points of the two plans [i.e. the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan]... These were... A single Executive Magistrate is at the head of the one—a plurality is held out in the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s4.html |title= Records of the Federal Convention, Article 2, Section 1, Clause 1 |year= 1787 |work= The Founder’s Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Pennsylvania ratifying convention in 1787, [[James Wilson]] emphasized the advantages of a single chief executive, including greater accountability, vigor, decisiveness, and responsibility:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he executive authority is one. By this means we obtain very important advantages. We may discover from history, from reason, and from experience, the security which this furnishes. The executive power is better to be trusted when it has no screen. Sir, we have a responsibility in the person of our President; he cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes. We secure vigor. We well know what numerous executives are. We know there is neither vigor, decision, nor responsibility, in them. Add to all this, that officer is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Wilson |first= James |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s8.html |title= Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention |date= December 4, 1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1788, the letters of the [[Federal Farmer]] were published, generally considered among the most astute of [[Anti-Federalist]] writings. The [[pseudonym]]ous Federal Farmer defended the proposed unitary executive, arguing that "a single man seems to be peculiarly well circumstanced to superintend the execution of laws with discernment and decision, with promptitude and uniformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Richard |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ybmeEcpEvlsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22superintend+the+execution+of+laws+with+discernment+and+decision%22 |title= Founding the American Presidency |page= 39 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year= 1999|isbn= 9780847694990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Federalists]] such as [[James Madison]] were emphasizing an additional advantage of a unitary executive. In [[Federalist No. 51]], he wrote that an undivided executive would strengthen the ability of the executive to resist encroachments by the legislature: “As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided [into branches], the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Madison |first= James |url= http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm |title= Federalist no. 51 |date= February 6, 1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Hamilton]] later pointed out that the Constitution grants executive power and legislative power in different ways, with the legislative powers of Congress being expressly limited to what is "herein granted," unlike executive powers which are not expressly limited by an enumeration. Hamilton wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the article which gives the legislative powers of the government, the expressions are "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States." In that which grants the executive power, the expressions are "The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States." The enumeration ought therefore to be considered, as intended merely to specify the principal articles implied in the definition of executive power....&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hamilton |first= Alexander |url= http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=h&amp;p=c&amp;a=p&amp;ID=27786&amp;c=748 |title= Pacificus Letters, No. 1 |date= June 29, 1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the principle of ''[[Statutory_interpretation#Textual|expressio unius]]'' may be more applicable as a limitation upon congressional power than upon executive power.  According to Hamilton, the unenumerated executive powers that are vested solely in the President "flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity with other parts of the Constitution, and with the principles of free government."&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

Those other parts of the Constitution include the extensive powers granted to Congress. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to make laws, which the President then must execute, provided that those laws are constitutional. Article I, Section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution known as the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] grants Congress the power to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution all Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof". The Constitution also [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Enumerated powers|grants Congress power]] "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The theory of the unitary executive can only be legitimate insofar as it allows Congress to wield its constitutional powers while ensuring that the President can do the same.

==Judicial decisions==
In the 1926 case of ''[[Myers v. United States]]'', the United States Supreme Court decided that the President has the exclusive power to remove executive branch officials, and does not need the approval of the Senate or any other legislative body.  The Court also wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ordinary duties of officers prescribed by statute come under the general administrative control of the President by virtue of the general grant to him of the executive power, and he may properly supervise and guide their construction of the statutes under which they act in order to secure that unitary and uniform execution of the laws which article 2 of the Constitution evidently contemplated in vesting general executive power in the President alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Myers v. United States |vol= 272 |reporter= U.S.  |opinion= 52 |pinpoint= |court= |date= 1926 |url=  http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=272&amp;page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent cases such as ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'' (Presidential removal of certain kinds of officers), ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' (executive privilege), and ''[[Bowsher v. Synar]]'' (control of executive functions) have flexed the doctrine's reach back and forth. [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] in his solitary dissent in ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'' argued for an unlimited presidential removal power of all persons exercising executive branch powers, which he argued included the [[independent counsel]]; the court disagreed, but later moved closer to Scalia's position in ''[[Edmond v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Calabresi |first1= Steven |last2= Lawson |first2= Gary |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/107/4/Calabresi-Lawson.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090306120412/http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/107/4/Calabresi-Lawson.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2009-03-06 |format= PDF |title= The Unitary Executive, Jurisdiction Stripping, and the Hamdan Opinions: A Textualist Response to Justice Scalia |journal= Columbia Law Review |year= 2007 |volume= 107 |pages= 1002–1047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the strong version of the theory==
[[Loyola Law School]] Professors [[Karl Manheim]] and [[Allan Ides]] write that "the separation among the branches is not and never was intended to be airtight," and they point to the President's veto power as an example of the executive exercising legislative power. They also cite other examples of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power being exercised by the executive branch, as necessary elements of the administrative state, but they contend that ultimately all administrative power belongs to Congress rather than the President, and the only true "executive" powers are those explicitly described in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Manheim Ides"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manheim |first1=Karl |last2=Ides |first2=Allan |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=943046 |title=The Unitary Executive |journal=Los Angeles Lawyer |date=September 2006 |id=Loyola-LA Legal Studies Paper No. 2006-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this understanding, Manheim and Ides follow in the footsteps of Lessig and Sunstein.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt;

Professors [[David Jeremiah Barron]] and [[Marty Lederman]] have also criticized the strong version of the unitary executive theory. They acknowledge that there is a compelling case for a unitary executive within the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Barron-Lederman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=David |last2=Lederman |first2=Martin |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/jan08/barron_lederman.shtml |title=The Commander In Chief At The Lowest Ebb: Framing The Problem, Doctrine, And Original Understanding |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=121 |page=689 |year=2008 |quote=we think the text, as reinforced by historical practice, makes a strong case for at least some form of a 'unitary executive' within the armed forces, particularly as to traditional functions during armed conflicts. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125114946/http://harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/jan08/barron_lederman.shtml |archivedate=January 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that the Constitution does not provide for an equally strong unitary executive outside the military context, and they argue that the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons|Commander in Chief Clause]] would be superfluous if the same kind of unitary presidential authority resulted from the general constitutional provision vesting executive power in the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=David |last2=Lederman |first2=Martin |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/feb08/barron_lederman2.shtml |title=The Commander in Chief at the Lowest Ebb: A Constitutional History |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=121 |page=941 |year=2008 |quote=there are those who would argue that the 'unitary executive' must have effective control over all Article II functions, in which case the superintendence guaranteed by the Commander in Chief Clause would not appear to do any additional work with respect to superintendence. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124223310/http://harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/feb08/barron_lederman2.shtml |archivedate=January 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to claims of some authors,&lt;ref name="Rethinking Presidential Power"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Kelley |first=Christopher |url=http://www.users.muohio.edu/kelleycs/paper.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rethinking Presidential Power: The Unitary Executive and the George W.

Bush]].  For example, in 1987, [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a [[signing statement]] that declared: "If this provision were interpreted otherwise, so as to require the President to follow the orders of a subordinate, it would plainly constitute an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority as head of a unitary executive branch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reagan |first=Ronald |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/092987d.htm |title=Statement on Signing the Federal Debt Limit and Deficit Reduction Bill |date=September 29, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''waqf''' ({{lang-ar|وقف}}), also known as '''habous''' or ''[[mortmain]]'' property, is an [[Alienation (property law)|inalienable]] charitable [[financial endowment|endowment]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for [[Muslim]] religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awqafsa.org.za/what-is-waqf/|title=What is Waqf - Awqaf SA|author=|date=|website=awqafsa.org.za|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donated assets may be held by a [[charitable trust]]. The person making such dedication is known as ''waqif'', a donor. In Ottoman Turkish law, and later under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the ''waqf'' was defined as [[usufruct]] State land (or property) of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine'' (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]), chapter 8, section 1, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, pp. 226–228&lt;/ref&gt; Although based on several [[hadith]]s and presenting elements similar to practices from pre-Islamic cultures, it seems that the specific full-fledged Islamic legal form of [[financial endowment|endowment]] called ''waqf'' dates from the 9th century CE (see paragraph "History and location").

==Terminology==

In Sunni jurisprudence, ''waqf'', also spelled ''wakf'' ({{lang-ar|وقف}}, pronounced {{IPA-ar|ˈwɑqf|}}; ''plural'' {{lang|ar|أوقاف}}, ''awqāf''; {{lang-tr|vakıf}} &lt;ref&gt;Hisham Yaacob, 2006, Waqf Accounting in Malaysian State Islamic Religious Institutions: The Case of Federal Territory SIRC, unpublished Master dissertation, International Islamic University Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt;) is synonymous with ''ḥabs'' (also called ''ḥubs'' or ''ḥubus'' and commonly rendered ''habous'' in French).&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Peters, R., Abouseif, Doris Behrens, Powers, D.S., Carmona, A., Layish, A., Lambton, Ann K.S., Deguilhem, Randi, McChesney, R.D., Kozlowski, G.C., M.B.

Heinrichs|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/wakf-COM_1333}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Habs'' and similar terms are used mainly by [[Maliki]] jurists.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; In [[Twelver Shiism]], ''ḥabs'' is a particular type of ''waqf'', in which the founder reserves the right to dispose of the waqf property.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The person making the grant is called ''al-waqif'' (or ''al-muhabbis'') while the endowed assets are called ''al-mawquf'' (or ''al-muhabbas'').&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The term waqf literally means "confinement and prohibition" or causing a thing to stop or stand still.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan (1984) as cited in HS Nahar and H Yaacob, 2011, Accountability in the Sacred Context: The case of management, accounting and reporting of a Malaysian cash awqaf institution, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 87–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal meaning of Waqf according to Imam Abu Hanifa, is the detention of a specific thing in the ownership of waqf and the devoting of its profit or products "in charity of poors or other good objects".

Imam [[Abu Yusuf]] and [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|Muhammad]] say: Waqf signifies the extinction of the waqif's ownership in the thing dedicated and detention of all the thing in the implied ownership of God, in such a manner that its profits may revert to or be applied "for the benefit of Mankind".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Bahaeddin Yediyıldız defines the waqf as a system which comprises three elements: ''hayrat'', ''akarat'' and ''waqf''. Hayrat, the plural form of
''hayr'', means “goodnesses” and refers to the motivational factor behind vakıf organization;
''akarat'' refers to corpus and literally means ”real estates” implying revenue-generating sources, such as markets (''bedesten''s, ''arasta''s, ''han''s, etc.), land, baths; and waqf, in its narrow sense, is the institution(s) providing services as committed in the vakıf deed such as ''madrasa''s, public kitchens (''imarets''), ''karwansaray''s, mosques, libraries, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=973726cf86a04152bc028759f3578aa8|title = The legacy of vakıf institutions and the management of social policy in Turkey|last = Deligöz|first = Halil|date = 2014|journal = Administrative Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic texts==
There is no direct injunction of the Qur'an regarding Waqf, which is derived from a number of [[hadiths]] (traditions of Muhammad). One says, "Ibn Umar reported, [[Umar|Umar Ibn Al-Khattab]] got land in [[Khaybar]], so he came to the prophet [[Muhammad]] and asked him to advise him about it. The Prophet said, 'If you like, make the property inalienable and give the profit from it to charity.'" It goes on to say that Umar gave it away as alms, that the land itself would not be sold, inherited or donated. He gave it away for the poor, the relatives, the slaves, the [[jihad]], the travelers and the guests. And it will not be held against him who administers it if he consumes some of its yield in an appropriate manner or feeds a friend who does not enrich himself by means of it.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-ʿAsḳalānī , Bulūg̲h̲ al-marām, Cairo n.d., no. 784. Quoted in Waḳf, ''Encylopaedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another hadith, Muhammad said, "When a man dies, only three deeds will survive him: continuing alms, profitable knowledge and a child praying for him."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-ʿAsḳalānī , Bulūg̲h̲ al-marām, Cairo n.d., no. 783. Quoted in Waḳf, ''Encylopaedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2016}}

==Life cycle==

===Founding===
[[Sharia|Islamic law]] puts several legal conditions on the process of establishing a waqf.

====Founder====
A waqf is a contract, therefore the founder (called ''al-wāqif'' or ''al-muḥabbis'' in Arabic) must be of the capacity to enter into a contract. For this the founder must:
*be an [[adult]]
*be [[Sanity|sound of mind]]
*capable of handling financial affairs
*not under interdiction for bankruptcy

Although waqf is an Islamic institution, being a Muslim is not required to establish a waqf, and [[dhimmi]]s may establish a waqf. Finally if a person is fatally ill, the waqf is subject to the same restrictions as a will in Islam.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

====Property====
The property (called ''al-mawqūf'' or ''al-muḥabbas'') used to found a waqf must be objects of a valid contract. The object should not be illegal in Islam (e.g. wine or pork). Finally these objects should not already be in the public domain. Thus, public property cannot be used to establish a waqf. The founder cannot also have pledged the property previously to someone else. These conditions are generally true for contracts in Islam.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

The property dedicated to waqf is generally immovable, such as estate. All movable goods can also form waqf, according to most Islamic jurists. The Hanafis, however, also allow most movable goods to be dedicated to a waqf with some restrictions. Some jurists have argued that even gold and silver (or other currency) can be designated as waqf.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

====Beneficiaries====
The beneficiaries of the waqf can be persons and public utilities. The founder can specify which persons are eligible for benefit (such the founder's family, entire community, only the poor, travelers). Public utilities such as mosques, schools, bridges, graveyards and drinking fountains can be the beneficiaries of a waqf. Modern legislation divides the waqf as "charitable causes", in which the beneficiaries are the public or the poor) and "family" waqf, in which the founder makes the beneficiaries his relatives. There can also be multiple beneficiaries. For example, the founder may stipulate that half the proceeds go to his family, while the other half go to the poor.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

Valid beneficiaries must satisfy the following conditions:&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;
* They must be identifiable. At least some of the beneficiaries must also exist at the time of the founding of the waqf. The Mālikīs, however, hold that a waqf may exist for some time without beneficiaries, whence the proceeds accumulate are given to beneficiaries once they come into existence. An example of a non-existent beneficiary is an unborn child.
*The beneficiaries must not be at war with the Muslims. Scholars stress that non-Muslim citizens of the Islamic state (dhimmi) can definitely be beneficiaries.
*The beneficiaries may not use the waqf for a purpose in contradiction of Islamic principles.

There is dispute over whether the founder himself can reserve exclusive rights to use waqf. Most scholars agree that once the waqf is founded, it can't be taken back.

The Ḥanafīs hold that the list of beneficiaries include a perpetual element; the waqf must specify its beneficiaries in case.&lt;ref name = EI&gt;Waḳf, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of founding====
The declaration of founding is usually a written document, accompanied by a verbal declaration, though neither are required by most scholars. Whatever the declaration, most scholars (those of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, some of the [[Hanbali]] and the Imami Shi'a schools) hold that it is not binding and irrevocable until actually delivered to the beneficiaries or put in their use. Once in their use, however, the waqf becomes an institution in its own right.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

===Administration===
[[File:Waqfnameh.JPG|thumb|Waqf Writing Room in [[Mevlana Museum]]]]
Usually a waqf has a range of beneficiaries. Thus, the founder makes arrangements beforehand by appointing an administrator (called ''nāẓir'' or ''mutawallī'' or ''ḳayyim'') and lays down the rules for appointing successive administrators. The founder may himself choose to administer the waqf during his lifetime. In some cases, however, the number of beneficiaries are quite limited. Thus, there is no need for an administrator, and the beneficiaries themselves can take care of the waqf.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

The administrator, like other persons of responsibility under Islamic law, must have capacity to act and contract. In addition, trustworthiness and administration skills are required. Some scholars require that the administrator of this Islamic religious institution be a Muslim, though the [[Hanafi]]s drop this requirement.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

===Extinction===
Waqf is intended to be perpetual and last forever. Nevertheless, Islamic law envisages conditions under which the waqf may be terminated:&lt;ref name = EI/&gt; 
*If the goods of the waqf are destroyed or damaged. Scholars interpret this as the case where goods are no longer used in the manner intended by the founder. The remains of the goods are to revert to the founder or his/her heirs. Other scholars, however, hold that all possibilities must be examined to see if the goods of the waqf can be used at all, exhausting all methods of exploitation before the termination.  Thus, land, according to such jurists, can never become extinguished.
*A waḳf can be declared null and void by the ''ḳāḍī'', or religious judge, if its formation includes committing acts otherwise illegal in Islam, or it does not satisfy the conditions of validity, or if it is against the notion of philanthropy. Since waqf is an Islamic institution it becomes void if the founder converts to another religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*According to the Mālikī school of thought, the termination of the waqf may be specified in its founding declaration. As the waqf would expire whenever its termination conditions are fulfilled (e.g. the last beneficiary). The waqf property then [[Reversion (law)|returns to the founder]], his/her heirs, or whoever is to receive it.

==History and location==
[[File:Madina trip 169.jpg|thumb|Uthman waqf (Medina)]]
The practices attributed to Muhammad have promoted the institution of waqf from the earliest part of Islamic history.&lt;ref&gt;Sait, 2006, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

The two oldest known ''waqfiya'' (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated ''waqfiya'' goes back to 876 CE, concerns a multi-volume Qur'an edition and is held by the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in [[Istanbul]]. A possibly older ''waqfiya'' is a papyrus held by the [[Louvre]] Museum in [[Paris]], with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century. The next oldest document is a marble tablet whose inscription bears the Islamic date equivalent to 913 CE and states the ''waqf'' status of an inn, but is in itself not the original deed; it is held at the [[Eretz Israel Museum]] in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert Paul Verbit |year=2002 |title=The Origins of the Trust |location= |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=141–142 |isbn=9781401031534 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}
 
===Egypt===
The earliest pious foundations in Egypt were charitable gifts, and not in the form of a ''waqf''. The first mosque built by '[[Amr ibn al-'As]] is an example of this: the land was donated by [[Qaysaba bin Kulthum]], and the mosque's expenses were then paid by the ''[[Bayt al-mal]]''. The earliest known ''waqf'', founded by financial official Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ali al-Madhara'i in 919 (during the [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid period]]), is a pond called Birkat Ḥabash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor.

===India===
Early references to Wakf in India, can be found in 14th century CE work, ''Insha-i-Mahru'' by Aynul Mulk Ibn Mahru. According to the book, [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Muizuddin Sam Ghaor]] (f. 1195–95 A.D.) dedicated two villages in favor of [[Jama Masjid]], [[Multan]], and, handed its administration to the [[Shaykh al-Islām|Shaikhul Islam]] (highest ecclesiastical officer of the Empire). In the coming years, several more wakfs were created, as the [[Delhi Sultanate]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahru|first=Ainud Din|title=Insha-i Mahru,  Lahore, 1965|year=1965|publisher=Shaikh Abdur Rashid (ed.)|location=Lahore|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Wakf Act 1954 (later Wakf Act 1995
) enacted by Government of India, Wakfs are categorized as (a) Wakf by user such as Graveyards, ''Musafir Khanas'' (Sarai) and ''Chowltries'' etc., (b) Wakf under ''Mashrutul-khidmat'' (Service Inam) such as ''[[Khazi]]'' service, ''Nirkhi'' service, ''Pesh Imam'' service and ''[[Khateeb]]'' service etc., and (c) ''Wakf Alal-aulad'' is dedicated by the Donor (''Wakif'') for the benefit of their kith and kin and for any purpose recognised by Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable. After the enactment Wakf Act 1954, the Union government directed to all the states governments to implement the Act for administering the wakf institutions like mosques, ''[[dargah]]'', ''[[ashurkhana]]s'', graveyards, ''takhiyas'', ''iddgahs'', ''[[imambara]]'', ''[[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu|anjuman]]''s and various religious and charitable institutions.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;[http://www.aponline.gov.in/apportal/departments/departments.asp?dep=25&amp;org=169&amp;category=about al Wakf Council, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622015150/http://www.aponline.gov.in/apportal/departments/departments.asp?dep=25&amp;org=169&amp;category=about |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statutory body under Government of India, which also oversees [[Central Wakf Council, India#State Wakf Boards|State Wakf Boards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/newsite/main/subj_alloc.asp Subjects allocated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924233558/http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/newsite/main/subj_alloc.asp |date=24 September 2010 }} [[Ministry of Minority Affairs]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the State Wakf Boards work towards management, regulation and protect the Wakf properties by constituting District Wakf Committees, [[Tehsil|Mandal]] Wakf Committees and Committees for the individual Wakf Institutions.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; As per the report of [[Sachar Committee]] (2006) there are about 500,000 registered Wakfs with {{convert|600000|acre|km2}} land in India, and [[Rs.]] 60&amp;nbsp;billion book value.&lt;ref name="summary_hindu"&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2324/stories/20061215004700400.htm Community on the margins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w&gt;[http://centralwakfcouncil.org/ Wakf] [[Central Wakf Council, India]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The ''waqf'' institutions were not popular in all parts of the Muslim world. In West Africa, very few examples of the institution can be found, and were usually limited to the area around [[Timbuktu]] and [[Djenné]] in [[Massina Empire]]. Instead, Islamic west African societies placed a much greater emphasis on non-permanent acts of charity. According to expert Illife, this can be explained by West Africa's tradition of "personal largesse." The imam would make himself the collection and distribution of charity, thus building his personal prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Feierman, 1998, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hamas, all of historic Palestine is an Islamic waqf, which translates as a "prohibition from surrendering or sharing".&lt;ref&gt;Max Abrahms, Why Terrorism Does Not Work, International Security, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Fall 2006), pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding of schools and hospitals==
[[File:Haseki-Huerrem-Sultan-waqf Jerusalem.png|thumb|150px|An Old Waqf Document]]
After the Islamic waqf law and [[madrassah]] foundations were firmly established by the 10th century, the number of [[Bimaristan]] hospitals multiplied throughout Islamic lands. By the 11th century, many Islamic cities had several hospitals. The waqf trust institutions funded the hospitals for various expenses, including the wages of doctors, [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmologists]], surgeons, [[chemist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Domestic worker|domestics]] and all other staff, the purchase of foods and [[wikt:medicine|medicines]]; hospital equipment such as beds, mattresses, bowls and perfumes; and repairs to buildings. The waqf trusts also funded medical schools, and their [[revenue]]s covered various expenses such as their maintenance and the payment of teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last1=Micheau |first1=Francoise |title=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East |pages=999–1001 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |editor1-last=Rashed |editor1-first=Roshdi |editor2-last=Morelon |editor2-first=Régis |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-02063-8}}&lt;!--specific pages 999–1001, whole section 985–1007--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with trust law==
The ''waqf'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which developed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] from the 7th to 9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the English [[trust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every ''waqf'' was required to have a ''waqif'' (founder), ''mutawillis'' (trustee), ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1237–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under both a ''waqf'' and a trust, "property is reserved, and its [[usufruct]] appropriated, for the benefit of specific individuals, or for a general charitable purpose; the corpus becomes [[Inalienable rights|inalienable]]; [[Estate (law)|estates]] for life in favor of successive beneficiaries can be created" and "without regard to the law of [[inheritance]] or the rights of the heirs; and continuity is secured by the successive appointment of trustees or ''mutawillis''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|p=1246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only significant distinction between the Islamic ''waqf'' and English trust was "the express or implied reversion of the ''waqf'' to charitable purposes when its specific object has ceased to exist",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1246–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this difference only applied to the ''waqf ahli'' (Islamic family trust) rather than the ''waqf khairi'' (devoted to a charitable purpose from its inception). Another difference was the English vesting of "legal estate" over the trust property in the trustee, though the "trustee was still bound to administer that property for the benefit of the beneficiaries." In this sense, the "role of the English trustee therefore does not differ significantly from that of the ''mutawalli''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|p=1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the [[Crusades]], during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Court of Chancery, under the principles of equity, enforced the rights of absentee Crusaders who had made temporary assignments of their lands to caretakers.  It has been speculated that this development may have been influenced by the ''waqf'' institutions in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hudson|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1244–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
