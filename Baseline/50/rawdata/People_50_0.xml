'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

===Place names===

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

'''Amedy Coulibaly''' ({{IPA-fr|amɛdi kulibali}}; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a [[Malians in France|Malian-French]] man who was the prime suspect in the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], in which [[Municipal Police (France)|municipal police]] officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.

He was a close friend of [[Charlie Hebdo shooting#Ch.C3.A9rif and Sa.C3.AFd Kouachi|Saïd and Chérif Kouachi]], the gunmen in the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected.  He said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-appears-to-show-paris-kosher-grocery-attack-suspect-coulibaly-swearing-allegiance-to-islamic-state-1420977506|title=Islamic State Releases Video Calling Grocery Store Gunman Its ‘Soldier’|author=David Gauthier-Villars in Paris, Asa Fitch in Dubai and Raja Abdulrahim in Beirut|date=12 January 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/09/fusillade-de-montrouge-suspect-identifie-deux-nouvelles-interpellations_4552503_3224.html Le suspect de Montrouge, Amedy Coulibaly, était bien le tireur de Vincennes], ''Le Monde'' (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="janeonyanga-omara,usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/11/video-gunman-islamic-state/21589723/|title=Video shows Paris gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State|author=Jane Onyanga-Omara|date=11 January 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic State magazine interviews Hayat Boumeddiene|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/islamic-state-magazine-interviews-hayat-boumeddiene|website=Guardian.com|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

==Early life==
[[File:GrandeBornePlaineCentrale.jpg|thumb|left|260px| Coulibaly grew up on [[La Grande Borne]] housing estate.]]

==Shootings on 7–9 January 2015==
{{See also|Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege|January 2015 Île-de-France attacks#Fontenay-aux-Roses and Montrouge shootings}}
Coulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt; In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.

The first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;

The second shooting occurred in [[Montrouge]] on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diondassanayake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/551314/Jewish-supermarket-siege-Paris-hero-hostage-tried-to-shot-Amedy-Coulibaly|title=Jewish supermarket siege: Heroic hostage executed after trying to turn weapon on gunman |author=Dion Dassanayake|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shooting took place at [[Porte de Vincennes]], east Paris, on 9 January. Coulibaly killed four more people, all Jewish patrons at a Jewish [[Hypercacher]] supermarket at Porte de Vincennes, at the outset of an hours-long siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers be freed.&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/11/french-authorities-hunt-most-wanted-woman-in-france-fears-new-terror-attack/|title=France's most wanted woman may have traveled to Syria, reports say|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBClive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-30722098|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Manhunt – live reporting|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.636178|title=Paris shooting updates / Charlie Hebdo attackers take hostage after car chase|date=9 January 2015|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/11/ce-que-l-on-sait-de-l-agression-d-un-joggeur-a-fontenay-aux-roses_4553732_3224.html Ce que l'on sait de l'agression d'un joggeur à Fontenay-aux-Roses] – ''Le Monde'' –  Emeline Cazi  – 11 January 2014 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/paris-gunman-amedy-coulibaly-allegiance-isis|title=Paris gunman Amedy Coulibaly declared allegiance to Isis|date=11 January 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of that attack, he introduced himself to his hostages, saying: "I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim.

==Aftermath==
After [[Mali]] refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in [[Thiais]].&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/23/terrorist-buried-near-paris-after-mali-rejects-corpse/|title=Terrorist buried near Paris after Mali rejects corpse|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

'''Amira Abase''', '''Shamima Begum''' and '''Kadiza Sultana''' are three British schoolgirls from the [[Bethnal Green Academy]] in London who left home in February 2015 to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). According to the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries have travelled to join the Islamic State as of 2015&lt;ref name="TMDUPGIP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltman|first1=Erin Marie |last2=Smith |first2=Melanie |title='Till Martyrdom Do Us Part' Gender and the ISIS Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=Institute for Strategic Dialogue |page=4|url=http://www.strategicdialogue.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Till_Martyrdom_Do_Us_Part_Gender_and_the_ISIS_Phenomenon.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—part of what some&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hegghammer, an expert on Islamist militancy affiliated with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (source: {{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}})&lt;/ref&gt; have called "a jihadi, girl-power subculture".&lt;ref name="isowbw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GILSINAN |first1=KATHY |title=The ISIS Crackdown on Women, by Women |journal=The Atlantic |date=25 July 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/the-women-of-isis/375047/|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The three girls had been questioned by the police in December 2014 after another girl from their school travelled to Syria, but were found not to be at risk.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; They flew via [[Turkish Airlines]] from [[Gatwick Airport]], London, to [[Istanbul]] on 17 February.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria girls: Families 'cannot stop crying'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31575908|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their families went to Turkey in March to probe the disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isil defector girls' families go to Turkey to probe disappearance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11491142/Isil-defector-girls-families-go-to-Turkey-to-probe-disappearance.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a [[Glasgow]] woman who joined ISIL in 2013. There have been electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; She faces criminal charges if she returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scots jihadi will be prosecuted if she comes home, say police|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/313329-scots-jihadi-aqsa-mahmood-will-be-prosecuted-if-she-comes-home-say-police/|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=STV|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmood denies the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=James|title=Glasgow 'jihadist' Aqsa Mahmood denies recruiting London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-31908202|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, on a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher [[Anjem Choudary]] against the film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]''. The [[Metropolitan Police]] examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Ben|title=Jihadi schoolgirl's father marched at flag-burning rally|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/jihadi-schoolgirls-father-marched-at-flagburning-rally-anjem-choudary-10138591.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussen said in April that he feels ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of schoolgirl feared to have joined Islamic State denies 'extremism' claim|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-04-07/father-of-schoolgirl-feared-to-have-joined-islamic-state-denies-extremism-claim/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=ITV News|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flight. They will not face criminal charges if they return to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=David|title=Three 'Jihadi brides' from London who travelled to Syria will not face terrorism charges if they return|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11461693/Sisters-of-the-missing-jihadi-brides-to-face-radicalisation-tests.html|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on its circumstances in March 2015.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The families of the girls received an apology from [[Scotland Yard]], who did not tell them about the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Police sorry for failure to warn families of Isis girls about schoolfriend's flight|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11415790|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has said that police should not be made "scapegoats" for people joining ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaders: Vigilance crucial or more will be lost to IS|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/leaders-vigilance-crucial-or-more-will-be-lost-to-is-1-3715147|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=The Scotsman|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said "Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beake|first1=Nick|title=David Cameron concerned over Syria-bound London girls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32134575|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teenagers have not made contact with their families since May 2016. Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">The '''Angel Makers of Nagyrév''' were a group of women living in the village of [[Nagyrév, Hungary]] who between 1914 and 1929 poisoned to death an estimated 300 people. They were supplied arsenic and encouraged to use it for the purpose by a midwife or "wise woman" named '''Susanna Fazekas''', wife of Julius Fazekas, née '''Susi Oláh''' (Fazekas Gyuláné Oláh Zsuzsanna). Their story is the subject of the [[documentary film]] ''[[The Angelmakers]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Astrid Bussink|title=The Angelmakers|url=http://archive.dokweb.net/en/documentary-network/east-european-docs/the-angelmakers-1539/|website=archive.dokweb.net|publisher=Edinburgh College of Art|accessdate=10 December 2016|language=Hungarian, English|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Rob|title=Mirren film brings war tragedy to Yorkshire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/06/film.filmnews|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=5 August 2006|ref=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|title=The Angelmakers {{!}} IDFA|url=https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?ID=38e77c53-fedc-4e9f-bc6d-b31b28fa5787|website=www.idfa.nl|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movie ''[[Hukkle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Stephen Holden|authorlink1=Stephen Holden|title=Film Festival Reviews; Life's Creatures Glow Until Violence Darkens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800EFDC1438F936A35757C0A9659C8B63|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=www.nytimes.com|date=5 April 2003|ref=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2017}}

==Crimes==
Mrs. Fazekas was a middle-aged midwife who arrived in Nagyrév in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Heather Sutfin|title=The Angel Makers of Nagyrév|url=http://swordandscale.com/the-angel-makers-of-nagyrev/|website=Sword and Scale|accessdate=10 December 2016|ref=Sword|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her husband already missing without explanation. Between 1911 and 1921 she was imprisoned 10 times for performing illegal [[abortion]]s, but was consistently [[acquittal|acquitted]] by judges supporting abortion.

In Hungarian society at that time, the future husband of a teenage bride was selected by her family and she was forced to accept her parents' choice. [[Divorce]] was not allowed socially, even if the husband was an [[alcoholic]] or [[domestic violence|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popham|first1=Peter|title=Hungary: Murder on the Danube|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-murder-on-the-danube-517007.html|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2005|ref=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], when able-bodied men were sent to fight for [[Austria-Hungary]], rural Nagyrév was an ideal location for holding [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. With the limited freedom of POWs about the village, the women living there often had one or more foreign lovers while their husbands were away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katherine Ramsland |authorlink1=Katherine Ramsland |title=Angels of Death – Nurses, nurses who kill their patients (Chapter 5, Murder by Proxy) |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com:80/notorious_murders/angels/female_nurses/5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303182947/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/female_nurses/5.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 March 2007 |website=The Crime library |accessdate=10 December 2016 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the men returned, many of them rejected their wives' affairs and wished to return to their previous way of life, creating a volatile situation. At this time Fazekas began secretly persuading women who wished to escape this situation to poison their husbands using [[arsenic]] made by boiling [[flypaper]] and skimming off the lethal residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fish|first1=Jim|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Europe {{!}} Unearthing Hungary husband murders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3567679.stm|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=news.bbc.co.uk|date=29 March 2004|ref=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barry Yeoman|title=Bad Girls|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199911/bad-girls|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC|date=1 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial killing of their husbands, some of the women went on to poison parents who had become a burden to them, or to get hold of their inheritance. Others poisoned their lovers, some even their sons; as the midwife allegedly told the poisoners, "Why put up with them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Heaney|title=11 Terrifying Female Serial Killers You've Never Heard Of|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/11-terrifying-female-serial-killers-youve-never-heard-of|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=15 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/arzenes_asszonyok_rendhagyo_sorozatgyilkossag_a_horthy_korban/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poisoning in Nagyrév took place in 1911; it was not the work of Mrs. Fazekas. The deaths of other husbands, children, and family members soon followed. The poisoning became a fad, and by the mid-1920s, Nagyrév earned the nickname "the murder district." There were an estimated 45–50 murders over the 18 years that Mrs. Fazekas lived in the district. She was the closest thing to a doctor the village had and her cousin was the clerk who filed all the death certificates, allowing the murders to go undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tonya Blust|title=Creepy crimes from the 1920s|url=http://www.historictruecrime.com/creepy-crimes-from-the-1920s/|website=www.historictruecrime.com|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three conflicting accounts have been cited to explain how the Angel Makers were eventually detected. In one, Mrs. Szabó, one of the Angel Makers, was caught in the act by two visitors who survived her poisoning attempts. She fingered a Mrs. Bukenoveski, who named Mrs. Fazekas. In another account, a medical student in a neighboring town found high arsenic levels in a body that washed up on the riverbank, leading to an investigation. However, according to Béla Bodó, a Hungarian-American historian and author of the first scholarly book on the subject, the murders were finally made public in 1929 when an anonymous letter to the editor of a small local newspaper accused women from the [[Tiszazug]] region of the country of poisoning family members. 

The authorities exhumed dozens of corpses from the local cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American front in the Hungarian village killer|url=http://eletmod.transindex.ro/?hir=3976|website=www.transindex.ro|publisher=Index Media Association|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 34 women and one man were indicted.  Afterwards, 26 of the Angel Makers were tried, among them Susi Oláh. Eight were sentenced to death but only two were [[capital punishment|executed]].  Another 12 received prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/036319900202700103 | author = Bodó, Béla | title = The poisoning women of Tiszazug | journal = Journal of Family History | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 40–59 | pmid = 11789522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are '''apocryphal biographies''' in the first edition (1885–1900) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (DNB), a major work on historical biography related to the [[United Kingdom]]. In other words, there is a biography that presents a life of a person asserted to have existed, but (in the light of later scholarship) the evidence for the person having lived has become regarded as tenuous or non-existent.

Examples are in [[:s:Category:Apocryphal biographies]], based on the updated ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (ODNB), where the corresponding article casts serious doubt on the DNB assertions.

==Kirkman Finlay==
'''Kirkman Finlay'''—supposed: (''c.'' 1802&amp;ndash;1828) was an alleged Scottish [[philhellene]].

The DNB has an article on this man,{{sfn|Goodwin|1889|p=32}} but more modern scholarship refutes its credibility. Monica Clough in the 21st century ODNB explains how the original source for the DNB probably confused fact with fiction and concludes by citing and quoting C. R. Fay (1951):
{{quote|
Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of April 1828 which called him into being,{{sfn|Gentlemen's Magazine staff|1828|p=372}} 'the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] "who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere"' can be safely buried.|Monica Clough&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clough|2004}} citing C. R. Fay, Huskisson and his age (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Robert Bruce (died 1094?) ==
Robert de Brus [Bruce] supposed nobleman, based on late medieval lists of those who fought at Hastings,{{sfn|Mackay|1886|p=114}} which are wholly unreliable.{{sfn|Cownie |2004}}

==Macduff 'thane' of Fife==
"A half or wholly mythical personage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Macduff |first=Thomas Finlayson |last=Henderson |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is not a literary invention, then he represents a supporter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], descended from [[Dub, King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Dauvit|last= Broun|title=Dubh  (d. 966)|id= 8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7001">[[Image:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|200px|upright|Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets'' (1779–81) was possibly the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''biographical film''', or '''biopic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|əʊ|p|ɪ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forvo.com/word/biopic/#en|title=biopic pronunciation: How to pronounce biopic in English, German|first=Forvo|last=Team|date=|website=forvo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation for ''biographical motion picture''), is a film that dramatizes the life of a [[non-fictional]] or [[historically]]-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Custen |first=George F. |title=Bio/pics : how Hollywood constructed public history |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1992 |oclc=24247491 |isbn=9780813517551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study ''Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Dennis |title=Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

The term '''Cairo 52''' refers to the fifty-two men who were arrested on May 11, 2001, aboard a floating [[gay nightclub]] called the '''Queen Boat''', which was moored on the [[Nile]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalacoura|first1=Katerina|title=Homosexuality as cultural battleground in the Middle East: culture and postcolonial international theory|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=2014|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1295–1296|doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.926119}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ashraf.jpg|thumb|280px|Ashraf Zanati, one of the Cairo 52, who later fled to [[Vancouver, BC]], [[Canada]].]] --&gt;

==Charges==
Of fifty-two men arrested, fifty were charged with "habitual debauchery" and "obscene behaviour" under Article 9c of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of [[Prostitution]].  Another two were charged with "contempt of religion" under Article 98f of the Penal Code. All fifty-two men pleaded [[innocent]]. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Cairo 52.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The Cairo 52 in detention.]] --&gt;

==Treatment of Arrest==
According to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] (IGLHRC), the men were subjected to beatings and [[forensic]] examinations to "prove their homosexuality".  All 52 men were kept for twenty-two hours a day in two cramped cells with no beds.

==Trials==
[[Image:QueenBoat.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Queen Boat]]
The trials of the "Cairo 52" lasted five months and the defendants were vilified in the Egyptian [[News media|media]], which printed their real names and addresses, and branded them as agents against the State. The trials were condemned by international [[human rights]] organizations, members of [[US Congress]] and the [[United Nations]]. Lawyers for the defense argued that the cases should be dismissed on the grounds of [[false arrest]], improper arrest procedures, falsified evidence and police intimidation. During the trial, homosexuality was characterized as "un-Egyptian".&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"/&gt;

On November 14, 2001, twenty-one of the men were convicted of the "habitual practice of debauchery," one man of "contempt for religion," and another, accused of being the "ringleader," was convicted of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years' [[penal labour|hard labour]].  A fifty-third man, a teenager, was tried in juvenile court and was sentenced to the maximum penalty of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of probation.

In May 2002, those convicted were released pending a second trial; both the guilty and not-guilty verdicts were overturned, provoking international outrage.  In July 2002, fifty of the men began a second trial (the other two men had been convicted of contempt for religion, and their sentences were upheld).  This trial, held at Qasr-al-Nil Misdemeanors Court in Cairo and presided over by Judge Abdel Karim, the same judge who had presided over the first trial, lasted only fifteen minutes, ending when Karim [[recusal|recused]] himself.  The trial was then moved to September.  The retrial ended in March, 2003.  Twenty-one men were handed three-year jail sentences and twenty-nine were acquitted.

==Cairo 52 in the media==
The Cairo 52 were featured in a documentary by After Stonewall Productions, narrated by [[Janeane Garofalo]], entitled ''[[Dangerous Living: Coming Out in the Developing World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214183007/http://www.afterstonewall.com/press.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of [[Maher Sabry]]'s unapologetic film ''[[All My Life (2008 film)|Toul Omry]]'' (''All My Life'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334617/#]&lt;/ref&gt;  details the lives of gay men in Egypt against the backdrop of the Cairo 52 and the notorious Queen Boat arrests. One of the characters in the film "Kareem" is almost arrested in the police raid on the floating discothèque. The news of the arrests and the follow-up in the media and newspapers is discussed by the characters throughout the film. One of the Cairo 52 men is featured in [[Parvez Sharma]]'s documentary ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' (2008).

The '''coat of arms of the King of Spain''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the monarch of Spain. The current version of the monarch's coat of arms was adopted in 2014 but is of much older origin. The arms marshal the arms of the former monarchs of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

Traditionally, coats of arms did not belong to a nation but to the monarch who would quarter his shield with territorial claims of his dynasty. Formerly, the Spanish monarch's arms were much more complex than they are today. It would feature the arms of the various territories of this dynasty. A simpler version of these arms, known as the ''lesser arms'', would also be used; This lesser arms were another set of arms within the centre of the full arms. During the later part of the Bourbon dynasty this would be quarterly Castille and Leon.

In 1868, during the [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|provisional government]] that followed the overthrow of Queen [[Isabella II]], an arms of ''national character'' was adopted; This 1868 arms created the present-day arrangement of elements in the shield. The "national arms" and "royal arms" would coexist after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1931, the royal arms was revised to incorporate what had been hitherto the "national arms" into the royal arms and to replace the former lesser arms of the King (i.e. quarterly Castille and Leon). The monarchy would later be abolished later that year.

When don Juan Carlos, grandson of Alfonso XIII (the last king of Spain), was chosen to be the successor of General [[Francisco Franco]], the arms adopted for his use in 1971 as Prince of Spain was quarterly Castille, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre. The heraldic achievement also included the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Cross of Burgundy and the yoke and bundle of arrows formerly used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; This would be the same arms he would use as King. Upon Felipe VI's ascension to the throne in 2014, the cross, yoke, and arrows would not be retained in the royal arms.

==Blazon==
The [[blazon]]ing of the coat of arms of the King of Spain is set out in Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.&lt;ref name="BOE527"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/06/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-6525.pdf |title=Real Decreto 527/2014, de 20 de junio, por el que se crea el Guión y el Estandarte de Su Majestad el Rey Felipe VI y se modifica el Reglamento de Banderas y Estandartes, Guiones, Insignias y Distintivos, aprobado por Real Decreto 1511/1977, de 21 de enero. |date=20 June 2014 |website= BOE Spanish Official Journal|series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Royal Decree 527/2014 setting up the Guidon and Standard of HM King Felipe VI and amends Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation, adopted on Royal Decree 1511/1977|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms was adopted when King [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]] was enthroned as King of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2014/06/19/felipe_cuenta_con_escudo_guion_propios_294797_305.html |title=Felipe VI ya cuenta con escudo y guión propios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felipe VI has his own coat of arms and guidon |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=www.heraldo.es |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which is for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which is for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which is for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which is for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Argent enté en point, with a pomegranate proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves vert, which is for [[Granada]].

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which is for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

All surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by eight diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the royal crown of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/armas-iden-idweb.html Coat of arms of His Majesty the King of Spain].

In 1969, General [[Francisco Franco]] appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] as his "successor to the Headship of the Spanish state with the title of King" but gave him the new title of [[Prince of Spain]] instead of the traditional title of [[Prince of Asturias]]. From 1971 to 1975, Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain used a coat of arms which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. Earlier coat of arms differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince of Spain, the King's royal crown has eight half-arches of which five are visible, while the Prince's one has only four half-arches of which three are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_historia/03_bandera_armada--14_miscelania--02_insignias_jefes_estado--05_juan_carlos_i_es ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971''].

'''Francesco Dattaro''' (c. 1495 &amp;ndash; 1576) and his son '''Giuseppe Dattaro''' (c. 1540 &amp;ndash; 1616), are the two principal builders of the most important family of [[Cremona|Cremonese]] architects of the fifteenth century. The Dattaros began their activity at the construction site of the [[Cathedral of Cremona]], joining the painters, members of the cabinet making Sacca family, and the engineer [[Antonio Melone]].

The family of '''Dezallier d'Argenville''' produced two writers and connoisseurs in the course of the 18th century.

[[File:Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  
[[File:Dézallier d’Argenville Vanghelisty.jpg|thumb|Dezallier d'Argenville.]]  

==Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville==
'''Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville''' (Paris, 1 July 1680 – 29 November 1765), avocat to the [[Parlement de Paris]] and secretary to the king, was a connoisseur of gardening who laid out two for himself and his family, before writing ''La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (published anonymously, 1709; second edition, 1713), based on his experience and his reading.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: '' La theorie et la pratique du jardinage. Ou l'on traite à fond des beaux jardins appellés communément les jardins de propreté, comme sont les parterres, les bosquets, les boulingrins, &amp;c. Contenant plusieurs plans et dispositions generales de jardins; nouveaux desseins…&amp; autres ornemens servant à la décoration &amp; embélissement des jardins. Avec la manière de dresser un terrain…'' His remark "A fine garden being no less difficult to contrive and order well than a good building" suggests that he had read [[Francis Bacon]]'s essay "Of gardening".&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the illustrations were by [[Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond]], who was credited as the author in the third edition, 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Gerda Gollwitzer, "The influence of Le Nostre" in ''The French Formal Garden'', 1974, Elizabeth B. MacDougall and F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, editors (Dumbarton Oaks)&lt;/ref&gt; As the work of a gentleman rather than a gardener, as previous French books on gardening had all been, Dezallier d'Argenville's work was laid out like a treatise of architecture, addressed as much to the architect and the patron as to the practising gardener. As its title suggests, the treatise is composed of two parts: the theoretical principles of the art of fine gardening and its practical applications. The first section considers the principles of siting the ''maison de plaisance'' relative to its gardens, techniques of laying out geometric figures in parterres, [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and formal tree plantations (''[[bosquet]]s''), and the planning of garden [[pavilion]]s and the siting of sculpture, an essential element in the ''jardin français''.  The second part applies the principles in earth works, terraces and stairs, and the [[hydraulics]] necessary for constructing ''[[jeux d'eau]]'': fountains, cascades, pools (''bassins'') and canals.

His rational principles could adapt formal [[parterre]] gardening to the simplified programs available to the upper middle class,&lt;ref&gt;Previous books on gardening had presented only the grandest royal and aristocratic projects.&lt;/ref&gt; which accounts for the immense popularity of his book, which is the central document in the 18th century formal garden in the wake of [[André Le Nôtre]]. The work went through thirteen editions in France,&lt;ref&gt;And unauthorized reprints from The Hague&lt;/ref&gt; where the English mode of landscape design scarcely made itself known before the French Revolution. It was published in a German version (1731)&lt;ref&gt;''Die Gärtnerey sowohl in ihre Theorie oder Betrachtung, als Praxi oder Übung'', translated by Frantz Anton Danreitter, gardener to the [[archbishop of Salzburg]] (Gollwitzer, p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into English by the architect [[John James (architect)|John James]], as ''The Theory and Practice of Gardening'' (1712, with a 2nd edition in 1728, and a 3rd edition in 1743, when the [[English landscape garden]], might have seemed to make its formal designs passé.) Dezallier d'Argenville's ''Théorique'' in its English version introduced the [[Ha-ha]], the invisible fence, to English practice.

==Dezailler d'Argenville==
Dezailler d'Argenville was called upon to edit or contribute more than 600 entries in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], published in parts from 1751.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036 |first=Frank A. |last=Kafker: |chapter=Notices sur les auteurs des dix-sept volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie |title=Recherches sur Diderot et sur l’Encyclopédie  Année |date=1989  |volume=7 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dezallier d'Argenville's interest in [[natural history]] resulted in two treatises, on shells and minerals, ''L'histoire naturelle éclaircie dans deux de ses parties principales, la lithologie et la conchyliologie''. (Paris 1742) ''La Conchyliologie, ou Traité sur la nature des coquillages'' 1757 etc.. The connoisseurship of shells and their most colourful and fantastic form was a gentleman's occupation and a worthy inclusion in a ''cabinet de curiosités'' before it became a science under the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system]] of classification.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London in March 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27argenville%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his success in the fields of gardening and natural history, Dezallier d'Argenville was a print collector. He organised his extensive collection by subject rather than by school, as outlined in the 'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux…' that he published in the ''Mercure de France'' in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux, écrite par M.

His son, '''Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville''' (1723–1796), was the anonymous author ''(M. D***.)'' of ''Voyage Pictoresque de Paris; ou Indication de tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans cette grande Ville en Peinture, Sculpture, &amp; Architecture'', which appeared in Paris in 1749, a connoisseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of Paris, with accounts of the leading academic and scientific organisations of the city. At least six further editions appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1752, 1757, 1765, 1770, 1778, 1780). A ''Voyage pittoresque des environs de Paris, ou Description des Maisons Royales, Châteaux &amp; autres Lieux de Plaisance, situés à quinze lieues aux environs de cette Ville '' by the same author appeared in Paris in 1755, a connoiseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of the surroundings of Paris in which the author especially paid a tribute to the triumphe of gardening. At least one further edition appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1768, 3rd edition).

Further works were ''Dénombrement de tous les fossiles de France'' and ''L'Oryctologie ou Traité des pierres, des minéraux et autres fossiles''.

He compiled also the ''Vies des Fameux Architectes Depuis la renaissance des Arts'' in two volumes, 1787, of which the second was devoted to sculptors. An abridged edition (''Abrégé de la vie...'') was often reprinted. A facsimile was published in Geneva 1972. He also wrote a ''Dictionnaire du jardinage, relatif à la théorie. et à la pratique de cet art'' (Paris, 1771) and a ''Manuel du jardinier ou journal de son travail distribué par mois,'' (Paris, 1772)  &lt;!--not this Dezallier d'Argenville:and contributed to the Encyclopédie by Diderot and d'Alembert.--&gt;

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Estlin''' "'''E.&amp;nbsp;E.'''" '''Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;cummings''', as he is attributed in many of his published works,&lt;ref name="chicago84"/&gt; was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the [[Cold War]] when he became a Republican and a supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E. Cummings|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.&lt;ref name=utexas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.&lt;ref name=utexas/&gt;

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. --&gt;

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"/&gt;

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

In the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]], awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]]. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in [[North Conway, New Hampshire]] at the Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/09/04/archives/ee-cummings-dies-of-stroke-poet-stood-for-stylistic-liberty-unusual.html|url-access=subscription|title=E.&amp;nbsp;E.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.

Cummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,&lt;ref name=Blumenkranz&gt;Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&amp;pg=PA449 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

&lt;!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**---&gt;

higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

&lt;/poem&gt;

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,&lt;br&gt;
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,&lt;br&gt;
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
LOVE, YOU DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
ESTLIN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right
 |quote  =&lt;poem&gt;
anyone lived in a pretty how town
(with up so floating many bells down)

Women and men (both little and small)

&lt;/poem&gt;
 |source =From "[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]" (1940)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 "anyone lived in a pretty how town" at the Poetry Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title="why must itself up every of a park" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title="anyone lived in a pretty how town" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;poem&gt;
:one day a nigger
:caught in his hand
:a little star no bigger
:than not to understand

:i'll never let you go
:until you've made me white"
:so she did and now
:stars shine at night.&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"&gt;Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

&lt;poem&gt;
:a kike is the most dangerous
:machine as yet invented
:by even  yankee ingenu
:ity(out of a jew a few
:dead dollars and some twisted laws)
:it comes both prigged and canted&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.&lt;ref Name="Reef"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.&lt;ref Name="Reef"&gt;''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. &lt;small&gt;DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.&lt;ref name="friedman92"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–21 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."&lt;ref name="chicago84"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926-1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings' "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]].'' On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI."
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ "E.E.

The '''Eight Witnesses''' were one of the two groups of witnesses who made a statement stating that they had seen the [[golden plates]] which [[Joseph Smith]], Jr. said was his source material for the [[Book of Mormon]]. The other group of [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] who said they saw the plates are called the [[Three Witnesses]].

==Testimony==
The testimony of the Eight Witnesses was first published at the end of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon and has been printed in nearly every edition since, although most subsequent editions moved the statement to the front of the book and included minor grammatical corrections.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shewn unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified that they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;According to Terryl Givens, Joseph invited the Eight "to a family prayer spot in the woods" and "matter-of-factly displayed to them the golden plates," whereas the Three were shown the plates "by an angel of God [who] came down from heaven." [[Terryl Givens]], ''By the Hand of Mormon'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

Toward the end of June 1829, at the [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] home in [[Fayette, New York]], Joseph Smith, Jr. (with [[Oliver Cowdery]] as scribe) finished the translation of the Book of Mormon. Near the end of translation process, a prophecy was translated from the [[Second Book of Nephi]] that three, and "a few" others, might see the golden plates. Subsequently, on June 28, 1829, near the Whitmer farm,&lt;ref name=Anderson2012&gt;{{citation |first= Gale Yancey |last= Anderson |date=Spring 2012 |title= Eleven Witnesses Behold the Plates |journal= [[Journal of Mormon History]] |volume= 38 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} the Three Witnesses had their experience. Thereafter, the Smith and Whitmer families traveled to the [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]]. On July 2, 1829, near the Smith home, the Eight Witnesses saw and handled the golden plates.&lt;ref name=Anderson2012 /&gt;{{rp|156}}

==About the witnesses==

The Eight Witnesses were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]]. Joseph Smith, Sr. was Joseph Smith's father, and Hyrum and Samuel were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were [[David Whitmer]]'s brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005) p. 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive .... The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the familiar relationship among the witnesses, satirist [[Mark Twain]] wrote, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=y589pE4d9FcC&amp;pg=PA113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split with Smith===
In 1838, the living members of Whitmer family (Christian Whitmer and Peter Whitmer, Jr. died in 1835 and 1836, respectively) became estranged from Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated along with other dissenters and fled Caldwell County after receiving an ultimatum from the [[Danites]].&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337, 339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached [[Salt sermon|a vitriolic sermon]] based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot .... Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably Danites by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders .... Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Smith, none of the Whitmers joined the group that was led by [[Brigham Young]] and would become [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Yet despite the estrangement of the Whitmer family, there is little evidence that any of the Eight Witnesses denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the gold plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Givens |first=Terryl |title=The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=99}}; {{Citation |last=Remini |first=Robert |title=Joseph Smith |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Group |pages=67–68}}. One third-hand source, the former Mormon leader Stephen Burnett, said in 1838 that [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] had told him that "the eight witnesses never saw [the plates] &amp; hesitated to sign that instrument for that reason, but were persuaded to do it." Stephen Burnett letter to Lyman E. Johnson dated April 15, 1838. Typed transcript from Joseph Smith Papers, Letter book, April 20, 1837 – February 9, 1843, microfilm reel 2, pp. 64–66, LDS Church archives&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam}}
The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], specified ten of his [[Sahabah|companions]] who were promised paradise. Those companions named in this hadith are referred to as '''The Ten With Glad Tidings Of Paradise''' ({{lang-ar|العشرة المبشرون بالجنة}}; ''al-`Asharaa al-Mubasharûn bi-l-Janna'').

==The Hadith==

{{Quote|Narrated [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]]:&lt;br&gt;that the Messenger of Allah said: "[[Abu Bakr]] is in Paradise, '[[Umar]] is in Paradise, '[[Uthman]] is in Paradise, '[[Ali]] is in Paradise, [[Talhah]] is in Paradise, [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair]] is in Paradise, '[[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] is in Paradise, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas]] is in Paradise, [[Sa'id ibn Zayd]] is in Paradise, and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah]] is in Paradise."|Collected by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/urn/636260|title=Hadith - Chapters on Virtues - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|author=|date=|website=sunnah.com|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Muslim view==
[[Muslim]]s put different weight on this hadith, the majority of the [[Sunni]]s, viewing it as very favourable whilst the [[Shia|Shiites]] dismmissed it in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
This hadith was narrated in three collections by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood, and [[Ibn Majah]].

The Sunni collection of hadith, called the ''[[Kutub al-Sittah]]'' (six major hadith collections), includes: ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''Sunan Abu Dawood'', ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'', ''Jami` at-Tirmidhi'' and ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]''. ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and ''Sahih Muslim'' are considered the most reliable of these collections.&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, pg. 160 Dar al-Ma’aarif edition; al-Tirmithi, under #3748; al-Tirmithi, Volume 5, Page 605, Hadith 3748; Abu Daoud, #4649 and #4650&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis say that Muhammad's companions were sorted into twelve groups and of these the ten promised paradise were ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html Twelve Ranks of the Companions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423065308/http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html |date=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck&gt;{{cite web | title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity – Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life| url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm| publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]]| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop ''Grands Magasins de Nouveautés'', where she lived until the age of 110.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]], and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier.

German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]
In 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a [[life estate]].&lt;ref name=LifeLease&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html |title=A 120-Year Lease on Life Outlasts Apartment Heir |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 [[French franc|francs]] (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LifeLease/&gt; Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;  During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she "competed with [[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=From an interview made in 1989 |publisher=Boutique.ina.fr |date=21 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop,&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccook&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C3313956| title=World's oldest person dead| date=4 August 1997| work=McCook Daily Gazette| page=1| accessdate=5 May 2011| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought some canvas, later describing him as "ugly" (''laid''), "blighted by [[Alcoholism#Signs and symptoms|alcohol]]" (''brûlé par l'alcool''), and visiting [[Prostitution in France|brothels]] (''il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance'').&lt;ref name=YouTube1994/&gt;

After her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of [[Florence Knapp (supercentenarian)|Florence Knapp]] on 11 January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 '''1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time'']; Guinness World Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to [[Carrie C. White]] of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research.&lt;ref name=SunJournal&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronda| last = Addy| title = Life Expectancy| url = http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 1 February 2009| work = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)| Sun Journal]]| date = 25 May 2008| accessdate = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see [[Longevity claims]] and [[Longevity myths]]).

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically. In Calment's youth each French town had its own solar time. In 1891 the introduction of railways motivated a unified French time zone in line with Greenwich Time in Britain. In 1940 the invading Germans changed the French time by one hour to German time, to which France still adheres as of 2016.}} In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Allard1998Englishchapter2" /&gt; 

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]]. At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including [[fencing]], cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]] ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs").

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (''crèmes''), cakes and in particular ''quatre-quarts'' ([[pound cake]]), and vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; At "retirement age" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishWitticisms/&gt; She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; 

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later monarchs see [[List of Pictish kings|List of Pictish Kings]]. Fib became a puppet state after the reign of the only true king Fib, it was a sub-kingdom from the 7th century BCE until the 9th Century CE (691 BCE - 837/843 CE) when Pictland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin, the last king to rule Pictland before Kenneth was Drest X thus making him the last king of the Fib puppet-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Henry VIII from NPG (3).jpg|thumb|220px|A portrait of Henry VIII, painted c. 1520]]

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

==Katherine of Aragon==
{{Main article|Katherine of Aragon}}
[[File:Catherine aragon.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Katherine of Aragon]]
[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 1533{{spaced ndash}}17 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/boleyn/|title=Anne Boleyn|website=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==
{{Main article|Catherine Howard}}
[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]
[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinister supporter came from the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|coat of arms of her father]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who displayed his shield on the breast of a single-headed Apostolic eagle displayed. Catherine's badges were a commemoration of the [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] from the [[Emirate of Granada|Moors]], where a victory was gained by the superiority of the Spanish archers. Both badges were combined with the [[Tudor rose]] (Henry's dynastic symbol).&lt;ref name="Pinces 142"&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

-----
The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

An alternative set of supporters for Queen Jane was reportedly: "Dexter a unicorn argent, crowned and unguled or, collared with a double wreath of white daisies and red roses; Sinister, a panther incensed, striped with various colours, gorged with a coronet of crosses patée and fleurs de lys alternately and chained or."&lt;ref name="Pinces 146"/&gt; The badge of the phoenix rising from the flames was granted posthumously by her son King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] to his maternal relations (who became the Dukes of Somerset), who continues to use it as a crest in their coat of arms to this day.&lt;ref name="Willment 71"&gt;Willement p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox Davies 597"&gt;Fox Davies p. 597&lt;/ref&gt;

-----
The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church dedicated to Saint Loup at [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud|Naud]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Provins]] in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious [[iconography|iconographic program]] in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the [[Trinity]]. About 980, Sevinus, [[archbishop of Sens]], made a gift to the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine community]] of the [[abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif]] at Sens of four altars ''in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum''&amp;mdash;"in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup"&amp;mdash;betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud]] among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the [[counts of Champagne]] and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community's dismay;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler, ed., ''Medieval France: an encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Saint-Loup-de-Naud".&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpted ''portail'' with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at [[Chartres]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark Maines, ''The Western Portals at Saint-Loup-de-Naud'', (New York: Garland) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when [[pilgrimage]]s brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and again by the [[Huguenots]] in 1567, during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

==Other saints Lupus/Loup==

Numerous communes of France are named Saint-Loup;&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of French places with this name, see [[Saint-Loup (disambiguation)|Saint-Loup]]. There is also a Saint-Loup in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], Belgium, and another in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; they commemorate several venerable early saints with the Latinized Germanic name of ''Lupus'' ("wolf"): besides Saint Loup de Sens, venerated in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] there are [[Lupus of Troyes|Saint Loup de Troyes]], Saint Loup de [[Bayeux]], one of the early Bishops of Bayeux; and—more locally venerated—Saint Loup de [[Limoges]], Saint Loup de [[Soissons]], and Saint Loup de [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. A number of the communes called Saint-Loup in the west of France are not easily connected with a specific Saint Loup.

The '''Monro of Fyrish''' family were a Scottish family and branch of the ancient highland [[Clan Munro]]. The family produced a notable dynasty of doctors to London in the 18th and 19th century where they were involved in early work on curing 'insanity'. Four generations occupied successively the position of (Principal) Physician of the notorious [[Bethlem Hospital]] (Bedlam). They were also leading members of a variety of important medical associations. Other members were painters, priests and philanthropists of note and one was an important early patron to [[J. M. W. Turner]].

Born 16 November 1715, Greenwich, son of Dr James Monro and Elizabeth Hay. Educated at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School, London]] then at [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he became a Fellow in 1741 and a Radcliffe Travelling Fellow until 1751. He continued his education at the University of Leyden in 1745, and visited other centres of learning in Europe. In 1747 he was awarded his degree of Doctor of Medicine from University College, Oxford.

In 1751 he was appointed Joint Physician of Bethlehem and Bridewell Hospital ([[Bethlem Hospital]]) as an assistant to his father. On his father's death in 1752 he succeeded as Physician of Bethlem Hospital.
Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1753, and acted as Censor on six separate occasions. He delivered the [[Harveian Oration]] in 1757. 
He barely published during his career which was for the most part devoted to the study of insanity for which he was apparently acclaimed for his success.

Dr John Monro retired in January 1783 after an attack of paralysis. He lived at 53 Bedford Square, London, but in 1791 moved to [[Monken Hadley|Hadley]], near Barnet in co Middlesex and died there 27 December 1791.

==Dr Thomas Monro==
{{Main article|Thomas Monro}}
[[File:Dr Thomas Monro.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dr Thomas Monro]]
While James Monro continued the senior line of the Monros of Fyrish, his younger brother Thomas Monro continued the family's medical profession:
Thomas Monro was born 1759, in London, to Dr John Monro and Elizabeth Culling Smith. Educated at Stanmore School under [[Samuel Parr]], at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and then [[Oriel College, Oxford]] where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1787.

Admitted as a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1791, and acted as Censor on three separate occasions. He delivered the [[Harveian Oration]] in 1799. In 1811 he was named as an Elect of the College.

Like his father and grandfather he was employed at [[Bethlem Hospital|Bedlam]], first as Assistant Physician in 1787, then as Principal Physician in 1816 as successor to his father. However, he did not stay in that position long and retired soon after. He attended on King [[George III]] in that monarch's last illness.

Dr Thomas Monro was an artist and a patron of other artists.  He taught [[J. M. W. Turner]] the techniques of [[Watercolor painting|tinted drawing]]&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell, in [[Robert Hewison]] et al., ''Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites'', Tate Gallery Publishing, 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and patronised the careers of Turner and of the landscape painter [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]]. The critic [[John Ruskin]] said in his "Notes" on Turner in March 1878, that 
::''"His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by Giston, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.''"

Thomas Monro established at his house in Bushey a school for artists and among those who spent time there were: Thomas Girtin, William Henry Hunt and J M W Turner. His own son Alexander was a talented watercolourist and his sketchbook can be seen in the Bushey Museum.

Coincidentally, Monro's distant kinsman [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar]] would later be one of Turner's chief patrons.

He died 14 May 1833 at [[Bushey]], Hertfordshire and was buried in the family vault in the churchyard of St James's church. In 1788 he married Hannah, daughter of Rev. Edward Woodcock, DD, the rector of Watford, and had, among other issue:

# Dr Edward Thomas Monro, of whom next.
# [[Henry Monro]] (1791–1814), an artist. Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811 and 1812, and at the British Institution in 1812. He left a few paintings of note, namely "Othello, Iago and Desdemona" and "[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=20199&amp;searchid=30327 The Disgrace of Wolsey]" (now in the [[Tate Gallery]]), but died at the age of 23. He left a [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp07325&amp;role=art sketch of his father], now in the possession of the National Portrait Gallery.
#Robert Monro (b.1799), educated at Harrow and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A Second Class in 1819 and M.A Second Class in 1821. He married and left issue.
#Alexander (b. 1802), who married with issue.

Dr Monro was noted for having attended approximately 400 commissions and trials in lunacy.

Dr Henry Monro followed in his family footsteps in dealing with mental health issues and published a variety of works on insanity and as well as stammering.

In 1846 he founded the House of Charity at 9 Rose (now Manette) Street, Soho, London (now the [[House of St Barnabas]]) and spent forty years at this institution working with the destitute of London. Among those involved in the founding of the House of Charity included the future Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and the [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne]], the Lord Chancellor, the latter serving as honorary secretary along with Dr Henry Monro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41052 Soho Square Area: Portland Estate – No. 1 Greek Street: The House of St. Barnabas-in-Soho | British History Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''musicians of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]''' all perished when the ship sank in 1912. They played music, intending to calm the passengers, for as long as they possibly could, and all went down with the ship. All were recognized for their heroism.

They were not on the [[White Star Line]]'s payroll but were contracted to White Star by the Liverpool firm of C.W. &amp; F.N. Black, who placed musicians on almost all British liners. Until the night of the sinking, the players performed as two separate groups: a [[quintet]] led by violinist and official bandleader [[Wallace Hartley]], that played at teatime, after-dinner concerts, and Sunday services, among other occasions; and the violin, cello, and piano trio of [[Georges Alexandré Krins|Georges Krins]], [[Roger Marie Bricoux|Roger Bricoux]], and [[Theodore Ronald Brailey|Theodore Brailey]], that played at the À La Carte Restaurant and the Café Parisien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_band.shtml/ |title=Titanic's Band or Orchestra|website=Titanic-Titanic.com| accessdate=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Titanic'' hit an iceberg and began to sink, Hartley and his fellow band members started playing music to help keep the passengers calm as the crew loaded the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s. Many of the survivors said that Hartley and the band continued to play until the very end. One second-class passenger said: {{quotation|Many brave things were done that night, but none were more brave than those done by men playing minute after minute as the ship settled quietly lower and lower in the sea. The music they played served alike as their own immortal requiem and their right to be recalled on the scrolls of undying fame.&lt;ref name="Valiant Musicians"/&gt;}}

According to the legend, a group of settlers led by a figure named Nunong Karugtong crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions.  After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement.  This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call "Binangonan de Lampon," which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.&lt;ref name="infantagov"/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*[[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines 1214]]
*[[Seventh Crusade|Seventh Crusade 1248]]
*[[Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle|Mons-en-Pévèle 1304]]

*[[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers 1356]]
*[[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke 1382]]
*[[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt 1415]]

The Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle,&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, Kelly (2006) : ''Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century''.

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Arnoul d'Audrehem]] - 14th-century former [[Marshal of France]].  He held the office from 1368 to his death in 1370 but never carried the banner in action.
*[[Guillaume de Martel]] - Seigneur de [[Bacqueville]]. He carried the Oriflamme at Agincourt and died there.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.323&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sir Pierre de Villiers carried the Oriflamme at the [[Battle of Roosebeke]] against the Flemish rebels of Ghent led by [[Philip van Artevelde|Philip van Artvelde]] in 1382.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==
[[File:Paul Klee WI (In Memoriam) 1938.jpg|thumb|An abstract painting of a person by [[Paul Klee]]. The concept of a person can be very challenging to define.]]
{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle and last/family/surname with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]

A '''personal name''' or '''full name''' is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a [[word-group]], with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the ''[[birth name]]'' or ''[[legal name]]'' of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called [[anthroponymy]].

In [[Western culture]], nearly all individuals possess at least one ''[[given name]]'' (also known as a ''first name'', ''forename'', or ''Christian name''), together with a ''[[surname]]'' (also known as a ''last name'' or ''family name'')—respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in [[Abraham Lincoln]]—the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan.  Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.

Another naming convention that is used mainly in the [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. Also note that the wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2005|title=The Arabic Naming System|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v28n1p020-021.pdf|journal=Councilscienceeditors.org|language=en|volume=28| issue = 1|pages=20–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s. For instance, as a middle name as with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with [[Björk Guðmundsdóttir]] (whose father was named Guðmundur) or [[Heiðar Helguson]] (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in [[Eastern world|Eastern]] cultures.

However, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be [[mononymous person|mononymous]]. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the [[Machiguenga people|Machiguenga]] of the Amazon, do not use personal names.{{efn-lr|The Machiguenga may have nicknames, but generally refer to each other by how they are related. They may disambiguate with biographical information, such as "sister, the one who slipped in the river".&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Wayne W (1964). Kinship relations in Machiguenga. pp. 17–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Allen W. ''Families of the forest: the Matsigenka Indians of the Peruvian Amazon''. [[University of California Press]], 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_JXC70OnxEgC&amp;pg=PA9 pp. 9–10]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on April 1, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-520-23242-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person's full name usually identifies that person for legal and administrative purposes, although it may not be the name by which the person is commonly known; some people use only a portion of their full name, or are known by titles, nicknames, [[pseudonym]]s or other formal or informal designations.

It is nearly universal for people to have names; the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] declares that a child has the right to a name from birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Text of the Convention on the Rights of the Child], Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989 entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with article 49, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Common components of names given at birth include:
* Personal name: The [[given name]] (or [[acquired name]] in some cultures)  can precede a [[family name]] (as in some European cultures), or it can come after the family name (as in some East Asian cultures), or be used without a family name.
* [[Patronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the father.
* [[Matronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the mother.
* [[Family name]]: A name used by all members of a family. In [[China]], surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In [[Europe]], after the loss of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system]], the common use of family names started quite early in some areas ([[France]] in the 13th century, and [[Germany]] in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Wales]], and some areas of [[Germany]], as well as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used [[patronymic]]s, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923) in [[Norway]], and [[Iceland]] still [[Icelandic name|does not use surnames]] for its native inhabitants. In [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named António de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as [[António Guterres]]. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] is often called [[Zapatero]]. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.
* In many families, single or multiple [[middle name]]s are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] families choose a [[saint]]'s name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]] when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.

Some people (called ''anonyms'') choose to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]], that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a [[pseudonym]].

For some people, their name is a single word, known as a [[mononym]]. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], of the magician duo [[Penn and Teller]], was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply "Teller". In some official government documents, such as his [[driver's license]], his given name is listed as ''NFN'', an acronym for "no first name".

The [[Inuit]] believe that the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the [[namesake]]s are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (''atiq''), but also by [[kinship]] title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In [[Judaism]], someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the [[Death (personification)#In Judaism|Angel of Death]] may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among [[Sephardi Jews]]). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the [[goyim|Gentile]] world.

Chinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]] and [[Japanese emperor]]s receive [[posthumous name]]s.

In some [[Polynesian culture]]s, the name of a deceased chief becomes [[taboo]]. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.

Depending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes [[title]]s) are considered part of the name.

==Feudal names==
{{Disputed section|date=February 2013}}

The [[royal family|royalty]], [[nobility]], and [[gentry]] of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in [[small capital]] letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]&lt;/span&gt;. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.

The bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word "Gloucester" in "What will Gloucester do?" meant the [[Duke of Gloucester]]). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the [[Royal Navy]] meant its captain (e.g., "Cressy didn't learn from Aboukir") while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., "The ''Cressy'' is foundering").

==Naming conventions==
A personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consists of one more parts, such as [[given name]], [[surname]] and [[patronymic]]. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of [[anthroponymy]].

In contemporary Western societies (except for [[Iceland]], [[Hungary]], and sometimes [[Flanders]], depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a [[given name]], which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents' [[family name]].  Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture.  Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas.  This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. [[George (given name)|George]], [[Georg (disambiguation)|Georg]], [[Jorge]]), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.

In earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called "X's son/daughter"; this is now the case only in [[Iceland]] and was recently re-introduced as an option in the [[Faroe Islands]]. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob's Son). In [[Kafirstan]] (now part of Pakistan) "Children are named as soon as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is thereafter known." &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Kafiristan] Encyclopedia Britannica, [[George Scott Robertson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a range of personal naming systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Patrick|last1= Hanks|first2=Harry|last2= Parkin |editor= Carole Hough|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S8DQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 |chapter= Family names |title= The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming  |location= New York |year= 2016 |publisher=  Oxford University Press |page=214 |isbn= 9780191630415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Binomial systems: apart for given name, people are described by their surnames, which they obtain from one of their parents. Most modern European personal naming systems, such as [[Russian name|Russian]] and [[Spanish name|Spanish]], are of this type.
* Patronymic systems: apart for given name, people are described by their [[patronymic]]s, that is given names (not surnames) of parents or other ancestors. Such systems were in wide use throughout Europe in the first millennium C.E., but were replaced by binomial systems. [[Icelandic name|Icelandic system]] is still patronymic.
* More complex systems like [[Arabic name|Arabic system]], consisting of [[paedonymic]] (son's name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.

Different cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.

{{names in world cultures|state=expanded}}

== Name order ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Given name]] and [[Family name]] --&gt;
[[File:MomoiExpoCrop.png|thumb|[[Haruko Momoi]] at the [[Anime Expo]] 2007 in [[Los Angeles]]; her name card features a spelling of her [[Japanese name|name]] ("Halko Momoi") written in Western order; in Japanese her name is {{Nihongo2|桃井はるこ}} ''Momoi Haruko'']]

===Western name order===
The order ''given name, family name'' is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most [[Europe]]an countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] [[Americas|America]], [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[Central India|Central]] and [[Western India|West India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]]).

Within alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a [[comma]] (e.g. Smith, John), representing the "lexical name order". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.

===Eastern name order===
The order ''family name, given name'' is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in [[East Asia]] (for example in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]), as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] [[Cambodia]] and [[South India|Southern]] and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]] (the original [[Hungarian prehistory|homeland of the Hungarians]] was likely in Asia, at the southern foothills of the [[Ural Mountains]]). 
It is common in popular use also in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]], as well as in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Romania]], possibly because of the influence of the bureaucratic use of putting the family name before the given name.

When East Asian names are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in [[letter case|capital letters]]. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).

Chinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013}} Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle''. [[M.E. Sharpe]], 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&amp;pg=PA632&amp;dq=%22Japanese+names%22+surname&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3GU_TqC1OaLFsQKvq_22AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Japanese%20names%22%20surname&amp;f=false 632]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on August 7, 2011. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}, {{ISBN|9780765603562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular journalism publications, western order is used for Japanese names.&lt;ref name="Saeki"&gt;Saeki, Shizuka. "First Name Terms." ''[[Look Japan]]''. June 2001. Volume 47, No. 543. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese names of contemporary individuals and Hungarian names are usually "switched" when individuals who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, ''Koizumi Jun'ichirō'' is known as [[Junichiro Koizumi]] in English, and Puskás Ferenc is known as [[Ferenc Puskás]]. But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, Máo Zédōng is known as [[Mao Zedong]] in English.

Names of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see [[Ichiro Suzuki]] instead of ''Suzuki Ichirō'' (although he is widely known simply as "Ichiro" in both Japan and North America), or [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] instead of ''Nakata Hidetoshi''. As for Chinese sportspeople, ''Yáo Míng'' is [[Yao Ming]] and ''Liú Xiáng'' is [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Names of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean [[football (soccer)|footballers]] and [[Sportsperson|athletes]] are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. [[Ahn Jung-hwan]], [[Hong Myung-bo]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Sohn Kee-chung]], [[Hwang Young-cho]]). [[Baseball]] players' names are usually changed to Western order; for example Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as [[Chan-ho Park]]. [[Golf]]ers' names are also typically switched to Western order; the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as [[Se-Ri Pak]]. Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Mordvins]] use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example [[Aleksandr Sharonov|Sharonon Sandra]] (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example [[Yovlan Olo]] (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).

Mongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.

==Non-human personal names==
Apart from the [[Linnaean taxonomy]], some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.

===Names of pets===
Pet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC&amp;pg=PA127 The complete idiot's guide to pet psychic communication], Debbie McGillivray, Eve Adamson, Alpha Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59257-214-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-214-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoxbJ_oF7LAC&amp;pg=PA10 Adopting a Pet For Dummies] Page 10, By Eve Adamson&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as [[ontologically]] different from unnamed [[laboratory animal]]s with which they work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a5k7231264jl2j22/ Proper names and the social construction of biography: The negative case of laboratory animals], Mary T. Phillips, Qualitative Sociology, Volume 17, Number 2, SpringerLink&lt;/ref&gt;

The name given to a pet may refer to its appearance&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA1 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 1, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or personality,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA7 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 2, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or be chosen for [[endearment]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA23 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 4, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or in honor of a favorite [[celebrity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/09/28/what-celebrity-would-you-name-your-pet-after/ What celebrity would you name your pet after?], by Margaret Lyons, Sep 28 2009, Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pet owners give human names to their pets. This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA13 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 3, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, [[pet]]s or sporting [[animal]]s are sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, such as the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], give animals nonhuman names because it would be seen as offensive and disrespectful to the person of the same name.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Dolphin names for each other===
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that humans are not the only animals that use personal names. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington studying [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in Sarasota Bay, Florida, found that the dolphins had names for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |title=Dolphins, like humans, recognize names, May 9, 2006,CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602074304/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |archivedate=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dolphin chooses its name as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animals/060508_dolphin_names.html Dolphins Name Themselves], By Bjorn Carey, posted: 8 May 2006, livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, 王, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. All posthumous names for rulers of Goryeo and Joseon end in two of the characters for ''Daewang'' (대왕, 大王, "great king"). This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&amp;newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s posthumous name was ''Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang'' (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕, 弘道宣烈平世肅憲懿孝康惠大成大王), while his temple name was ''Gwangjong''. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. The deposed king's names were made up of three parts: the temple name (묘호), eulogistic names (존호) and  posthumous names (시호). During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The deceased king, who before his temple and posthumous names was decided, was called ''Daehaeng daewang'' (대행대왕, 大行大王). The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. When officials of the the ministry of culture and education selected three candidates and reported them to the next king, the next king chose the one of those names that he liked best. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, 君, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples. And there are some men who they didn't ascend the throne in their lifetime, but proclaimed as kings after they died by the their descendants who became king. There are nine men who proclaimed as kings in the Joseon Dynasty. In Joseon, there are nine men who raised to the status of the emeritus kings.

[[Gojong of Joseon]] proclaimed Korea an empire in 1897, receiving the title of emperor, thus the posthumous names of Gojong and [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] end in two of the characters for ''Hwangje'' (황제, 皇帝, "emperor"). For example, full posthumous name of Emperor Gojong of Korea is ''Tongcheonyung-un Jogeukdonyun Jeongseonggwang-ui Myeonggongdaedeok Yojunsunhwi Umotanggyeong Eungmyeongripgi Jihwasinryeol Oehunhong-eop Gyegiseonryeok Geonhaenggonjeong Yeong-uihonghyu Sugangmunheon Mujanginik Jeonghyo Taehwangje'' (통천융운조극돈윤정성광의명공대덕요준순휘우모탕경응명립기지화신렬외훈홍업계기선력건행곤정영의홍휴수강문헌무장인익정효태황제, 統天隆運 肇極敦倫 正聖光義 明功大德 堯峻舜徽 禹謨湯敬 應命立紀 至化神烈 巍勳洪業 啓基宣曆 乾行坤定 英毅弘休 壽康文憲 武章仁翼 貞孝太皇帝), or ''Taehwangje'' for short.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 117 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

[[File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svg|thumb|The Royal Arms of Great Britain from 1714 to 1801, with crest, supporters and motto]]

The '''Royal coat of arms of Great Britain''' was the [[coat of arms]] representing royal authority in the sovereign state of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in existence from 1707 to 1801. The kingdom came into being on 1 May 1707, with the [[political union]] of the [[kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[kingdom of England]], which included [[Wales]]. With the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] (ratified by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]), it was agreed to create a single kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, but not Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown.

On 1 January 1801, the royal arms of Great Britain were superseded by those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]] following the suppression of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

The Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland (the Protectorate) was created in 1653. St Andrew's Cross was added to the arms in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;
Scotland was formally reunited with England by an Ordinance of 12 April 1654 which ordered: "That the arms of Scotland viz: a Cross commonly called the St Andrew's Cross be received onto and borne from henceforth in the Arms of this Commonwealth ... etc".

{{Italic title}}[[File:Oskar Schindler and a few of the Jews he rescued, 1946.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Oskar Schindler]] (second from the right) poses with a group of Jews he rescued during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. The picture was taken in 1946, one year after the war ended.]]
The '''''Schindlerjuden''''', literally translated from [[German language|German]] as "'''Schindler's Jews'''", were a group of roughly 1,200 [[Jews]] who were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]] during [[the Holocaust]]. They survived the years of the Nazi regime primarily through the intervention of Schindler, who found them protected status as industrial workers at his [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|enamelware factory]] in [[Kraków]] and, after 1944, in an [[Brünnlitz labor camp|armaments factory]] in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|occupied Czechoslovakia]]. There, they avoided being sent to [[Extermination camp|death camps]] and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the ''Schindlerjuden''.

Their story has been depicted in the book ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', by [[Thomas Keneally]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the survivors, persuaded Thomas Keneally to write the novel and Steven Spielberg to produce the film.

In 2012, there were estimated to be over 8,500 descendants of ''Schindlerjuden'' living across the [[United States]], Europe, and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2012/mar/28/survivor-of-the-holocaust-tells-how-schindler/|title=Survivor of the Holocaust tells how Schindler saved her life|last=Smith|first=Larry|date=28 March 2012|work=Tribune 242|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The List==
The original list of ''Schindlerjuden'' who were transported to [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Schindler's Brünnlitz factory]] in [[Brněnec]], [[Sudetenland|occupied Czechoslovakia]], was prepared by [[Mietek Pemper]], [[Itzhak Stern]] and Oskar Schindler during September and October of 1944.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Mietek Pemper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjJNDD9m?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date={{date|2011-6-11|mdy}} |archivedate=2012-10-27 |accessdate={{date|2012-10-27|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Oskar Schindler's collaborator, Mietek Pemper, has died |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Oskar+Schindler+collaborator+dies/4919305/story.html |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Mietek Pemper, 91, Camp Inmate Who Compiled Schindler's List |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621040823/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html?_r=1 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=18 June 2011 |archivedate=2011-06-21 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That list likely no longer exists.

Another list with 1,000 names, compiled by Pemper upon the prisoners' arrival 21 October 1944 at Schindler's [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Brünnlitz factory]], was presented by him to the [[International Tracing Service]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html#c2713 Sample Documents from the ITS Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721233447/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html |date=2011-07-21}}, [[International Tracing Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lists of 1,098 prisoners made by camp administration in Brünnlitz on 18 April 1945 are extant, and are preserved in [[Yad Vashem]] Memorial, where Oskar and [[Emilie Schindler]] are recognized among [[Righteous Among the Nations|the Righteous]].&lt;ref name="Righteous"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/schindler|title=Oskar and Emilie Schindler {{!}} www.yadvashem.org|website=www.yadvashem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oskarschindler.com/list.htm|title=Schindler's entire List|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oskarschindler.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first list contains 297 female prisoners while the second list contains 801 male prisoners. There are several preserved copies and carbon copies of the list from April 1945, with some in museums while others are in private hands, mostly of families of former prisoners. In April 2009, a carbon copy of the original list, documenting 801 names, was discovered among the documentation ''Schindler's Ark'' author Thomas Keneally had donated to the [[State Library of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/04/08/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n2esp|title=Hallan la lista de Schindler|author=Reuters|first=|date=8 April 2009|website=|publisher=[[La Jornada]]|language=es|trans-title=Finding Schindler's List|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Analysis ==
This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.
# [[Nicanor the Deacon|Nicanor]] died when Stephen was martyred.
# [[Timon the Deacon|Timon]], bishop of Bostra.
# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

'''"Sing girls"''' ({{zh|c=星女郎|p=''xīng nǚ láng''}}) is a nickname for actresses who starred alongside [[Stephen Chow]], often as the main character's romantic interest.&lt;ref name=eastday&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoy.eastday.com/e/20071012/u1a3160012.html | title=张雨绮亲述一夜成名:30秒搞定周星驰 (Zhang Yuqi's overnight fame: 30 seconds to win over Stephen Chow) | author=邱致理 (Qiu Zhili) | publisher=南都周刊 | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films,&lt;ref name=dayoo&gt;{{cite web | publisher=大洋 (dayoo.com) | accessdate=28 June 2009 | url=http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | title=从"翻版张柏芝"看女星整容是非 (From "New Cecilia Cheung", seeing if female stars are having makeovers or not) | editor=许慧健 (Xu Huijian) | date=9 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203656/http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | archivedate=5 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow&amp;mdash;[[Zhang Yuqi]], for example, has been referred to as Chow's "[[:wikt:protégée|protégée]]" after appearing in the 2007 film ''[[CJ7]]''.&lt;ref name="ChowsPlay"&gt;&lt;!--This URL should not be linked, as it appears to be copyvio, but here it is for quick reference: http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/158-Stephen-Chows-Play-CJ7.html--&gt;{{cite news |work = [[Straits Times]]|author = Boon Cheng|title = Stephen Chow's Play: CJ7|date = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese word 星 ''xīng'' refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (''Sing Yeh'', "Grandmaster Sing")&lt;ref name=dayoo/&gt; and to [[:wikt:明星|明星]], the word for a star or [[celebrity]].

Chow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, [[Zhao Wei|Vicki Zhao]] already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'',&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt; and [[Gong Li]] was already famous as an "Yimou girl" ([[:zh:谋女郎|谋女郎]]) for her frequent collaboration with director [[Zhang Yimou]] before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s. Many times, though, starring with Chow has been a "Sing girl"'s first major role and has kick-started her career, as ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' did for [[Cecilia Cheung]]. [[Eva Huang]] and [[Kitty Zhang]] both gained considerable attention from media and [[netizens]] after appearing in ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' and ''[[CJ7]]'', respectively, even though their roles were relatively small (Huang's role had no lines at all).&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt;

[[Kingdom Yuen]] appeared in numerous 1990s Stephen Chow films not as a lead female or romantic interest, but rather in minor roles as a comedic [[stock character]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=4 July 2009 | url=http://www.brns.com/hkactors/pages/page48.html | title=Yuen King-tan/Kingdom Yuen | work=Hong Kong Cinema: View from the Brooklyn Bridge | first=Yves | last=Gendron | date=5 October 2004}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest "Sing girl" is 7 year old Zhang Yuwen, who appears in ''[[Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20130218/0947217139.html|title=揭秘《西游》最小星女郎 张煜雯喊星爷哥哥|publisher=Hunan TV|accessdate=2013-03-28|date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10471">The '''Splat Pack''' is a collection of [[independent filmmakers]] who, since 2002, have directed, written and produced numerous R-rated [[horror film]]s, notable for their [[Low-budget film|low budgets]] and extreme ultra-violence.&lt;ref name="the splat pack"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Splat Pack |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549299,00.html |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= October 22, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] of ''[[Total Film]]''.&lt;ref name="blood brothers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood Brothers  |first=Alan |last=Jones |authorlink=Alan Jones (film critic) |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956275.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been credited with bringing back ultra-violent movies, as well as moving away from [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rated movies and into the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] spectrum, all while operating with [[independent film|low budgets]].&lt;ref name="the splat pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrors"&gt;''New York Post''; October 22, 2006.

{{Theosophy}}

'''St. Germain''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Master Rakoczi''' or '''Master R''') is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]] and identified with the '''[[Count of St. Germain]]''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a [[courtier]], [[adventurer]], [[charlatan]], inventor, [[Alchemy|alchemist]], pianist, violinist and amateur composer.

==Legend==
Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin ''[[Sanctus Germanus]]'', meaning "Holy Brother".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 – 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 – 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 – 322&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the ''Master R'', or the ''Master Rakóczi'', is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.

==Literature about St. Germain==

===Biographies===
There are several "authoritative" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912) and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret – St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]] in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]] and ''L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[François Ethuin]].

===Occult biography===
A book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the [[Bacon's cipher|cipher code that he employed]].

===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===
Saint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as "Godfré Ray King" describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and some other works referenced above. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the "I AM" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the "Green Books." Another work of great importance, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, ''a.k.a.'' the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the "I AM" Religious Activity.

===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===
Several [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.
* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, "the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears "a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [["I AM" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his "training" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Cayce]], the "Sleeping Prophet", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: "When needed." (From reading # 254–83 on 2/14/1935.)
* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice 23.5.2014.
*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973 St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, USA. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meeting with him as well as other Masters.
*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on June 10, 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book: Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age .&lt;ref&gt;"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY" (Meru Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric activities===
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. (See [[Hall, Manly P.|Manly Palmer Hall]]'s ''Secret Teachings of All Ages.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on "St. Germain"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the "Chohan of the Seventh Ray"&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80–90 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called "The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is "The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]."  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the "Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]".

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rakóczi'' or the ''Master R.''&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three – Division A – Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that "sometime after AD 2025," the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would "externalise"&lt;!--British spelling of externalize--&gt;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530&lt;/ref&gt; Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the "manager of the executive council of the Christ"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508&lt;/ref&gt;(Theosophists regard "the Master Jesus" and "Christ" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which "Christ" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]]). According to certain Theosophists, "Christ" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the "executive council of the Christ" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

===Previous incarnations===
According to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)

* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called "The City of the Sun"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].
* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].
* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* [[Proclus]], c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named "[[Christian Rosenkreuz]]" was inspired by his efforts.
* [[Christopher Columbus]], 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain
* [[Francis Bacon]], 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].

===Ascension into masterhood===
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own "funeral" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rakóczi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biologographical sketch of history of Saint Germain, pages 80–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">The '''Syndicate of Seven''' is the name given to the original members of the Broken Hill Mining Company formed in 1883, who lodged applications for mining leases along the Line of Lode at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The members, who all worked at the remote [[Mount Gipps Station|Mount Gipps]] [[Sheep station]], were:-

#[[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (1848 – 1907) – station manager.
#[[Charles Rasp]] (1846 – 1907) – a [[boundary rider]], who was interested in [[prospecting]], recognised the importance of the site and pegged out the first mining lease.
#Philip Charley (1863 – 1937) – a young man learning to be a sheep farmer, employed as a [[boundary rider]].
#David James (1854 – 1926) – a contractor employed to sink water tanks and mend fences.
#James Poole (1848 – 1924) – an employee of David James.
#George Urquhart (1845 – 1915) – a bookkeeper and overseer
#George Lind (1861 – 1941) – a storekeeper.

[[Image:Philip Charley thumb.jpg|right|Philip Charley in 1887]]

"Each of the above seven contributing the sum of £70 each".

(Curtis 1908, and Camilleri 2006).

In September 1883 they pegged seven {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} blocks (blocks No 10–16) along the exposed lode at Broken Hill, thus securing almost the whole of the easily worked ore (Curtis, 1908).

The Syndicate of Seven was masterminded by [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (Camilleri, p17, 2006).

The initial assay results were not encouraging and Poole, Urquhart and Lind sold their share before the boom days and flotation of Broken Hill Proprietary in 1885 (Curtis, 1908 and Camilleri, 2006). James Poole sold half his share to [[Sidney Kidman]] who went on to become a wealthy cattle baron and landowner.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.
