'''Abdul Kahar Muzakkar''' was the leader of an Islamic movement in [[South Sulawesi]] from 1950 till his death in 1965. He led his group of men in a guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian central government, and was finally killed by the army in the jungle. He was also the leader of the South Sulawesi branch of the [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] movement.

== Early life [1920-1943] ==
Born on 24 March 1920 in the Kingdom of [[Luwu]], a smaller principality on the northern end of the Gulf of Bone,&lt;ref name="Chaidar 1999"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Chaidar| first =A|  title =Pemikiran politik proklamator negara islam indonesia s.m. kartosuwirjo.| publisher = Indonesia: Darul Falah.| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Kahar Muzakkar was formerly known as Ladomeng. Ladomeng is a Buginese word derived from 'dominoes', an allusion to his father who was playing cards at the time he was born.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Hamdan| first =J.|  title =The struggle for formalist islam in south sulawesi: From darul islam (di) to komite persiapan penegakan syariat islam (kppsi)
 | publisher = Australian National University | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Malinrang, was reportedly a businessman who was from the lower aristocracy class.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Their family owned many lands, a sign of wealth at that period of time.

Kahar completed elementary school in 1934, and his parents then sent him to Muhammadiyah Standard School in Palopo (capital of Luwu) for 4 years. He was then sent to [[Surakarta|Solo]] in Central Java to study in the ''Kweekschool'' Muhammadiyah (Islamic Teachers College) from 1938 to 1941.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; It was in this last institution that Kahar was introduced to a number of prominent [[ulema]], including a prominent modernist Muslim nationalist, Abdul Kahar Muzakkir. In fact, some people claimed that it was contact with this ulema that prompted Kahar to change his name from Ladomeng. There were other views, though, that Kahar had his name changed before he went to Solo, whilst according to Tommy Thomson, Kahar's former guard in the jungle, Kahar's 2 close friends, Jufri Tambora and Siddiq Bakri had been the one who asked Ladomeng to change his name to Kahar.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

According to sources, Kahar was average as a student, and that his strength lay not in formal education, but in creativity and talent in dealing with problems.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; In fact, Kahar did not even complete ''kweekschool'', partly because he married Walimah, a girl from Solo who was his first wife. It was with Walimah that he then returned to Palopo, teaching at a [[Muhammadiyah]] school until 1943.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Andaya| first =Leonard|  title =People and society in indonesia: A biographical approach.| publisher = Victoria: Monash University | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not an exceptional student, Kahar was actively involved in organizations, particularly after he had returned to Palopo. He joined the local ''Hizbul Wathan'', the youth organization for Muhammadiyah, and was active in his opposition to what he called the feudal system in Luwu, and called for an end to the aristocracy. His opposition gained him many support from the Luwu youths. Kahar remained active in ''Hizbul Wathan'' until the [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5RExJA1G2V4J:repository.unhas.ac.id/bitstream/handle/123456789/827/The%2520Japanese%2520Occupation%2520in%2520South%2520Sulawesi%2520%28terjemahan%29.rtf%3Fsequence%3D1+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg&amp;client=firefox-a arrival of the Japanese] in 1942.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; During the Japanese Occupation, Kahar worked as a clerk at the Nippon Hodobu, an information agency in Makassar under the Japanese authority.

In 1943, Kahar was sentenced by the ''Hadat'' (governing council) of the kingdom of Luwu to ''ripaopangitana'' [literally, to put someone or something face downward on the land], or simply to treat someone as dead.This form of punishment not only banishes the person from the kingdom, but also causes him to sever all ties which a Bugis or Makassar person is dependent on.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; There were varied accounts for the reason for such a sentence, all indicating that Kahar had alienated and angered the ruling powers in Luwu, particularly in his position as an activist of ''Hizbul Wathan''. There are views that Kahar criticized the belief in ''Sawerigading'', which claims that only the descendents of the ''Sawerigading'' can rule Luwu. According to his sister, Sulaeha, Kahar asked the aristocrats to discard the use of aristocratic titles, such as ''opu'', due to its inherent discrimination. Military documentation also disclosed that Kahar rejected the tradition of bowing the knees before aristocrats. He also acted in ways that oppose the traditional system of his homeland, such as marrying a Javanese girl at a time when cross cultural marriages were not common in the Buginese tradition. According to Barbara Harvey, the versions of reasons for Kahar's exile are as many as the persons who spoke about it. Mukhlis, in his writing, attempted to interpret Kahar's punishment, concluding that he broke 2 main rules: ''Mapparibokoang Arung'' (guilty of self-importance and abusing his position) and he did ''mpleo weloie Arung'' (attempted to overthrow of the rulers' position) in his position as a ''Hizbul Wathan'' activist. At the time Kahar was expelled, he swore to return and marry a descendent of the ''Pajung'' (king), a prophecy which came true as he later married Andi Haliah, the granddaughter of the ''Pajung''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Nationalist activities [1945-1949] ==
After his exile in 1943, Kahar moved to Java and set up a merchandise company known as ''Semangat Muda'' (Spirit of Youth). He also established a shop called ''Toko Luwu.'' It was through this business that Kahar entered the Indonesian nationalist movement. His company was used by him and his colleagues from South Sulawesi to establish an organization, ''Gerakan Pemuda Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Indonesian Youth Movement of Sulawesi, GEPIS) on 10 October 1945. This organization was later renamed ''Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Sulawesi Indonesian Youth Movement, APIS). This renamed organization became a part of the ''Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia'' (API) and was nationally recognized.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In one of his writings, Kahar revealed that he was one of [[Sukarno|Sukarno's]] bodyguards when the latter gave one of his first mass speeches in September 1945. He was the person, armed with only a machete, who was prepared to protect Sukarno and Hatta against the bayonets of the Japanese soldiers who tried to disperse the meeting and who encircled the car in which Sukarno and Hatta were driving. Kahar's role as bodyguard is not in question, with photographic evidence. According to Hamdan Juhannis, even Ukkas Arifin, a former nationalist activist in Kahar's movement who later became a member of the Republican military, revealed in his writing that he had witnessed the bravery of Kahar in guarding Sukarno in the same meeting.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar helped in the founding of ''Kebaktian Rakyat Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Loyalty of the Indonesian People from Sulawesi, KRIS), along with A. "Zus" Ratulangie, daughter of the Republican Governor of Sulawesi.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Harvey| first =Barbara|  title =Permesta: Half a Rebellion| publisher = Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Modern Indonesia Project, Southeast Asia Program, Cornell University.| year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; KRIS was the most famous of organisations in which Sulawesi youths participated in during the [[South Sulawesi Campaign|fight against the Dutch]]. APIS was merged into KRIS soon after and Kahar became the first secretary of KRIS.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"/&gt; In this capacity, Kahar was tasked with forming branches of KRIS in East and Central Java, thus the formation of KRIS branches in Solo, Yogyakarta, Madiun, Malang, Tegal, Magelang and Cilacap. It was during this period that Kahar met a group of political prisoners of the Dutch from the Nusakambangan and Cilacap prisons, who originated from the outer islands.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; He was on his way to Cilacap when he interceded and negotiated the release of the 800-odd prisoners, who were then given brief military training. This battalion became the core of Kahar's army. It also operated as Sukarno's protection guard when he moved to Yogyakarta.

After leaving KRIS due to internal conflicts, Kahar was tasked by [[Sudirman|General Sudirman]] to prepare for the formation of a republican army in Sulawesi. He then formed the ''Tentara Republik Indonesia Persiapan Sulawesi'' (Sulawesi Preparatory Unit of the Army of the Republic of Indonesia, TRIPES) which was formed on 24 March 1946.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redaksi. , Taufik, A., Aswab, M., &amp; Dhakidae, D. 1978"&gt;{{cite book  | author =Redaksi  | author2 =Taufik  | author3 =Aswab  | author4 =Dhakidae  | last-author-amp =yes |  title =Manusia Dalam Kemelut Sejarah| publisher = Jakarta: Lembaga Penelitian, Pendidekan dan Penerangan Ekonomi dan Sosial.| year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion of political prisoners whose release Kahar had negotiated formed the core of TRIPES. Members of Kris were also incorporated into TRIPES.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"/&gt; Kahar was the commander of TRIPES, and he, helped by Major Andi Mattalatta and Major Saleh Lahade, both from South Sulawesi, began to organize the infiltration of soldiers from Java into South Sulawesi by boats in 1949.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Kahar, however, remained in Yogyakarta and later formed a special military unit called ''Barisan Berani Mati'' (Dare-Devil Unit, BBM)&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"&gt;{{cite book  | last =van Dijk| first =C.|  title =Rebellion under the banner of islam : The darul islam in indonesia.| year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the last remaining battalion of the unit which fought in the Madiun area of East Java.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt;

Following this, and the transfer of sovereignty of East Indonesia to the Republic in December 1949, Kahar had expected to be appointed commander of South Sulawesi since he had been one of the principal figures in organising and sending troops of Sulawesi youths back to their homeland in 1946 to support the pro-Republican guerrillas against the Dutch. However, his name was not in the list of newly appointed members of the Territorial Command for East Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; This was a time when education, technical qualifications and discipline were all important and emphasized as criteria for qualifications, thus making Kahar ill-qualified. He did not have formal military training or battle experience, and his rebellious character was considered an obstacle to the integration of the army.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Moreover, Kahar had no powerful friends in the military, thus opposition for his ambition to be commander of the South Sulawesi unit was not just by the army, but also by other South Sulawesi officers such as Saleh Lahade and Andi Mattalatta.

== Joining the rebellion [1950-1952] ==
Instead of commander of the South Sulawesi unit, Kahar was appointed as the commander of the ''Komando Grup Seberang'' (Group Commando for the Outer Islands, KGS) in October 1949. He was promoted to the rank of 'acting' lieutenant-colonel, and was put in charge of coordinating the guerrilla units in Sulawesi, Kalimantan, the Moluccas and Nusa Tenggara.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; Even before the appointment of Kahar as the commander of KGS, he had sent 2 of his staff officers, Saleh Sjahban and Bahar Mattaliu, to South Sulawesi to establish contact with the guerrilla forces there in April 1949. On 17 August 1949, the ''Kesatuan Gerilya Sulawesi Selatan'' (South Sulawesi Guerrilla Unit, KGSS) was founded with the aim of uniting the many guerrilla bands operating in the area.

After the formal recognition of Indonesia's independence by the Dutch, Kahar suddenly found himself an unemployed officer when the KGS was disbanded. At the same time, fighting broke out between the newly established army command in South Sulawesi and KGSS, when the latter demanded to be part of the TNI.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; Kahar was ordered to return to Sulawesi to negotiate with these young men. On 22 June 1950, Kahar arrived in Ujungpandang, and initially cooperated with the Indonesian government and army. However, upon his return from a meeting with the guerrillas, he put forward the proposal made by the guerrillas instead. The military commander of East Indonesia, [[Alexander Evert Kawilarang|Kawilarang]], rejected the guerrillas' demands in a meeting with Kahar on 1 July 1950. Instead, Kawilarang issued a decree liquidating KGSS on the same day.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt;

Kahar, according to Bahar Mattaliu, was very angry at Kawilarang's reaction. Kahar resigned from the Army, pulling off his insignia rank saying '"Ini tidak ada gunanya. (This is of no use)" to Kawilarang. He then threatened that if KGSS's demand was not accommodated, they would rebel.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; A few days later, Kahar was kidnapped into the forest by the KGSS on the initiative of [[Andi Sose]], though it was suggested that the action had Kahar's tacit consent.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt;

From then on, Kahar and KGSS had overwhelming support form the local population. This was a major factor which ensured the guerrillas' ability to safely operate in the area.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; Kahar became the leader of the movement, with his presence further encouraging the men, who looked up to him for his record as a soldier with the highest rank from Sulawesi. Many also saw Kahar as having been betrayed by the central government and deserving of sympathy.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar had the guerrillas ignore the ban on KGSS, and functioned as an illegal organization.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; Though essentially enemies of the Republic, there were moments when KGSS assisted the Republican Army, notably in ensuring them a safe landing-place during the [[Andi Aziz|Andi Abdul Azis]]' rebellion and fighting against the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Royal Netherlands East Indies Army [KNIL]]]. However, during one of these assists, an incident occurred which cemented the hatred of the Sulawesi population against the Javanese, and by extension, the central government. It was alleged that one of the Republican units commanded by Captain Latief of the Mataram Brigade had opened fire on 2 guerrilla leaders and their contingents, with the intention of getting rid of the guerrillas. The 2 leaders, Arief Rate and Abbas Bangsawan, were killed, along with many of the guerrillas and Arief's whole contingent.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; This hatred by the population proved to be valuable to Kahar in his rebellion.

== Links to Darul Islam [1952-1965] ==
Before 1952, [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo|Kartosuwirjo]], the leader of the [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] movement in West Java, sent a letter to Kahar inviting to join his movement. Kahar only replied on 20 January 1952, accepting the invitation to make Sulawesi part of the Islamic State of Indonesia. However, Kahar clarified in the same letter that he did not think Sulawesi is ready to adopt the DI movement formally, as some of his followers were still influenced by communism [which happened before his arrival in Sulawesi] and the lack of commitment on their part in initiating an Islamic revolution. According to Kahar:

"Actually, we have also wanted to initiate an Islamic revolution since 16 August 1951 [based on what I plan with Brother Abd. Fattach and Brother Saleh Sjahban], but unfortunately, these two brothers are not committed. That made our effort failed and our power was defeated by stronger and more influential powers in society which were unconsciously influenced by 'reddish' ideology."&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

On 27 February 1952, Kartosuwirjo replied to Kahar's letter, appointing the latter as the commander of Division IV, Hasanudin of the Indonesian Islamic Army. Kartosuwirjo also expressed his gratitude to Kahar for acknowledging him as the supreme commander of the Islamic State of Indonesia, and reminded him of the importance of being under the banner of the Darul Islam. In the whole organization of DI in Indonesia, Kahar was the Deputy Minister of Defence, and the Commander of the Fourth Military District (East Indonesia) and the Fourth Division (Hasanuddin). However, there cannot be said to be an active coordination between the central DI movement and the South Sulawesi DI movement.&lt;ref name="van der Kroef 1958"&gt;{{cite book  | last =van der Kroef| first =J. M.|  title =Disunited Indonesia (ii).| publisher = Far Eastern Survey | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 1953, Kahar formally proclaimed South Sulawesi as part of the West Java Darul Islam at a gathering in Makalua. He read the proclamation of 1949, claiming that Sulawesi and its surroundings were part of the Islamic State of Indonesia. At this same gathering, Kahar also issued several regulations to start off the new movement. He announced the new DI flags for South Sulawesi and its surroundings. The state flag was to be red with a yellow crescent and three yellow stars, while the military flag was red with three yellow stars and the number '24'.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; He also activated a curfew within the areas of DI, and Islamic law was formally adopted. Kahar called on those who were not Muslims to voluntarily support the Islamic community, and labelled the existing guerrillas who were not part of the Islamic army as ''quttautthariq'' (Ar. 'robbers').

In 1955, Kahar, in the name of the East Indonesia DI, called to the Muslim community, ulema, and Islamic political parties to understand the content of the term ''jihad''. He also concentrated on the creation of a legal basis in the application of the formalist Islamic system within the organization. In 1955, the DI held a conference at Makalua, and a constitution known as the 'Makalua Charter' was drafted to guide the South Sulawesi people. Kahar created systems to support the existence of the NII. He started collecting taxes, all in the name of the Islamic state, and also established organizations. He founded a youth organization, Pemuda Islam Jihad, whilst his wife, [http://www.rakyataceh.com/index.php?open=view&amp;newsid=237&amp;tit=Berita%20Utama%20-%20Corry%20Sampaikan%20Surat%20Kahar%20Muzakkar%20untuk%20Soekarno Susana Corry van Stenus], instituted a woman's fighter corps called ''Laskar Wanita''.

Kahar also began to extend the DI influences outside South Sulawesi, soon after he was accepted as being under the West Java DI. He first expanded DI to Southeast Sulawesi, and around 1955, North Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Irian Barat came under the influence of Kahar's DI.

== Death ==
According to the information collected by Anhar Gonggong, Kahar was killed on 3 February 1965 by Corporal Sadeli of the Indonesian Army. It was reported that Sadeli heard the sound of a radio playing in the forest near the Lasolo River area, and approached the source of the sound, knowing that Kahar always carried with him a transistor radio.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Zurbuchen| first =Mary|  title =Beginning to remember : The past in the indonesian present| publisher = Seattle: University of Washington Press| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadeli had initially wanted to capture Kahar alive, but upon seeing the grenade in his hand, he shot to kill instead. He then compared a photograph of Kahar with that of the dead body, and concluded that the man he had killed was truly Kahar. The body was retrieved by a helicopter and flown to Makassar, where it was received by [[Mohammad Jusuf]] at Palemonia Hospital. Upon the announcement of Kahar's death, only one of his wives, 2 children and an uncle were authorized to see the body. Kahar's son, Abdullah, identified his father from the eczema on his foot and his dentures.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

However, this claim of Kahar's death had been refuted by many of his followers. There were some{{who|date=September 2013}} who claimed that Kahar was a distance away from where the fighting purportedly took place. Moreover, Kahar was always surrounded by 2 platoons of armed bodyguards, and he carried a rifle, not a grenade, as was mentioned in the radio news and newspapers which reported on his death. For these followers, the government news stories were pure propaganda. A whole platoon claimed that they were with Kahar at Lasolo at the supposed time of death, and he disappeared when they left him for a while. However, there was no trace of bloodshed in the area to indicate any sort of fight or struggle. Mansur, one of Kahar's close assistant, also insisted that he was with Kahar when the latter's death was announced on the radio. A few days later, Kahar simply disappeared while Mansur was taking a bath in the river.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

All these witness accounts point not to the death of Kahar, but to a mere disappearance, a view that was supported by his followers. There were some people{{who|date=September 2013}} who claimed that it was Jusuf who had merely faked the death of Kahar based on an earlier face-to-face meeting. These people believed that when Kahar and Jusuf met in Bonepute first on 21 October 1961 and then on 12 November 1961, Jusuf suggested to Kahar that he should go into hiding. It was said that they embraced tearfully. Based on this version, Kahar agreed to be picked up by helicopter to make his escape while another retrieved someone else's body in his place. According to Tihami (1984), the body was dropped in the sea between Makassar and Jakarta so that no one would be able to claim that it was not Kahar's. People also doubted Abdullah's capacity to identify his father as he had spent his childhood in Java with his mother, and rarely saw his father. He had only seen Kahar for 3 days 3 yrs before his death, although they did share a bed. Said Abdullah: "The problem is that no one else saw the corpse. I did, however." &lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt; Another version that claims to refute Kahar's death draws on the Sulawesi tradition of a ''tomanurung'' (one who descends from heaven) who comes to earth to serve the ruler by protecting the general population from corrupt, authoritarian and abusive leaders. According to the myth constructed and believed by his followers, Kahar is a ''tomanurung''. Therefore, he did not die, but ascended temporarily to heaven, awaiting the time when it is necessary to come back. These suggestions of Kahar as a ''tomanurung'' are usually accompanied by accounts of him living in exile, where he was both engaged in strategic work and at the same time practicing Sufi meditation. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

For many of his followers, the issue of Kahar's alleged death is close for discussion he purportedly said before he left: "I'll go away from you all for some time, don't ever try to look for me, because you simply can't. But, if I want to, I can easily find you." There was also a very prevalent belief that Kahar had merely gone into hiding and had taken another persona. This new identity of Kahar, many believed, was Syamsuri Abdul Madjid also known as Syekh Imam Muhammad Al Mahdi Abdullah. Syamsuri died in 2006, and was said to have been close to Susana Corry van Stenus, one of Kahar's wives.

The government's position on this issue, though, is that Kahar is truly dead, killed in the jungle on 3 February 1965, a position sustained by both Harvey (1974) and van Dijk (1981). This, though, did not stop the contemporary movement from capitalising on the mystery and controversy of Kahar's death. Mansur's version of events at the time of Kahar's supposed death, though gotten third-hand and thus less reliable, had been the one that has galvanised the movement's followers. Jusuf's silence, on the other hand, had conspired in expanding the truth, wittingly or not. A core group of contemporary Kahar's loyalists includes a number of members of NGOs who are involved in a varied field of activities ranging from cooperatives, legal practice and farming, to youth training, and professionals employed in Sulawesi as teachers, lecturers, lawyers, consultants and engineers. In addition to evoking stories of his escape or his ''tomanurung'' status, contemporary staff members of the movement also institutionalise their stance on Kahar's death through the use of slogans attributed to him such as 'Javanese colonialism' and 'Majapahitism'.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Though he had been dead for many years, Kahar is still remembered in Sulawesi. His legacy differs for different groups, motivated by their own interests of regional politics and movement vitality. Many of the leaders and former members of Kahar's movement had operated underground and been in hiding after his death. Thus, many of the current members do not know each other as the leaders coordinate the operations through staff and cells. Therefore, Kahar's legacy often focuses on him being a symbol of the movement that he had been a part of.

Kahar had been remembered by non-members of the movement, even till today. Many of these non-members were knowledgeable about Kahar, but for various reasons, they were not supportive of it. Many claimed that they did not support him that time, and will not do so even now. Some said too, that Kahar had brought much suffering to the people of Sulawesi. For those who had been members but had left after Kahar's death, a clear goal and a replacement for Kahar as a capable leader is needed before they will support the movement again. For youths who had only known of the movement and Kahar recently, there are various opinions. Some had positive impressions as they too saw the 'need for a democratic federal state',&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt; whilst others had considered him a traitor to the country.

The issue of Kahar being either a rebel or fighter for the people of South Sulawesi had resurfaced in contemporary time, when South Sulawesi's governor, [http://syahrulyasinlimpo.com Syahrul Yasin Limpo], challenged the people to fight rebels in the area. This created an uproar of critiques from many parties in South Sulawesi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tribunnews|title=Akademisi: Kahar Muzakkar Bukan Pemberontak|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/2012/06/10/akademisi-kahar-muzakkar-bukan-pemberontak|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Tribun News.com|date=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are of the opinion that Kahar was not a rebel or a traitor, but indeed, he was a patriot who had fought for Indonesia's independence. He only became a rebel to fight for a principle that he truly believed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=H.A.B.Amiruddin Maula|title=Qahhar Mudzakkar, Pejuang atau Pemberontak?|url=http://www.fajar.co.id/read-20120808233442-qahhar-mudzakkar-pejuang-atau-pemberontak|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Fajar Online|date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing Kahar, discussions on [[Kartosuwirjo]] and [[Daud Beureu'eh]] had also surfaced. These three figures had been active in the Darul Islam movement, a movement that some people in contemporary Indonesia still view as necessary. Many are of the opinion that these three figures had been excluded from national history, even though they had contributed to the fight for independence between 1945 till 1949 in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mustholih|title=Pejuang Kemerdekaan Yang Tersingkir|url=http://news.okezone.com/read/2012/11/10/337/716480/pejuang-kemerdekaan-yang-tersingkir|accessdate=15 November 2012|newspaper=Okezonenews|date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary time, Kahar's movement had been institutionalized in the form of two branch organizations, the ''Komite Persiapan Pelaksanaan Syariat Islam'' (Organizing Committee for the Preparation for the Application of Islamic Law; KPPSI) which was founded by Kahar's son Abdul Aziz 2000, and ''Pusat Amanat Referendum Rakyat Sulawesi'' (Center for Trusteeship of the Sulawesi People's Referendum; PARAS) which was also established in 2000.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

== Writings ==
During the course of the rebellion, Kahar was active in writing. His writings include monographs, speeches and regulations. He was said to have written more than 10 monographs,&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; of which not all are available to the public. Hamdan Juhannis claims that Kahar's writings especially reflect an effort to strengthen the legitimacy of Darul Islam as most touch on Islamic issues, quoting Quranic verses against the republican government. Several reasons for this had been brought forth, such that Kahar saw a need to 'Islamize' his DI community in South Sulawesi, and that he wrote for a general audience to help outsiders understand the nature of formalist Islamism.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar's writings were influenced by his short-temperedness and his broad knowledge.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Many of them were rather emotional, even to the extent of attacking his enemies like Sukarno. They also reflect his broad knowledge, especially on Islam and politics. Most of his writings can be categorised into general points, namely: his position from a defender to opponent of the pancasila, Islamic democracy verses Sukarno's Java-centricness, Islam versus other ideologies like the pancasila and communism, and his changing conception of state - from an Islamic federation to that of a caliphate system. According to Deliar Noer, Kahar's writings also are significant for it not only addressed the people in his time, but also provide lessons in idealism, and at least a guide for later generations to continue such idealism.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[al-Qaeda]]. In 1998, he  joined the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and became an [[MI6]] spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31700894|title=The spy who came in from al-Qaeda|date=2015-03-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dean was born in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 12 he had memorised the Quran and become a [[Hafiz (Quran)|Hafiz]]. Following the death of his mother he sought solace in [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s [[Fi Zilal al-Quran|In the Shade of the Koran]]. He was part of an Islamic Awareness circle at [[Omar Bin Abdulaziz Mosque]] in [[Khobar]], where one of the instructors was [[Yusef al-Ayeri]]. In 1989 his eldest brother Moheddin went to fight in Afghanistan for 3 months.  At 15 he travelled to Bosnia to participate in the [[Bosnian War]] with a friend from the circle [[Khaled Ali Hajj]] who had returned from fighting in Afghanistan.  In Bosnia he was part of the [[Bosnian mujahideen]] Brigade who massacred over 200 prisoners by decapitation following the [[Battle for Vozuća]].  He witnessed his friend Khaled saw off the head of a prisoner with a serrated hunting knife. Just before the end of the war he was recruited by [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] who suggested that he go to Afghanistan and give him a contact in Peshawar, Pakistan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Al-Qaeda==
Following Bosnia, Dean was invited to [[Kandahar]] to swear allegiance to [[Osama bin Laden]] and join [[al-Qaeda]].  In Afghanistan he trained al-Qaeda recruits in the basics of Islamic theology, history and the essentials of religious practice. He was worried by the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] and asked [[Abdullah al-Mohaja]] for the religious justification.  He was pointed to a 13th Century [[Fatwa]] by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].  He researched the [[Fatwa]] which was about the Mongol invasion and their use of human shields when besieging cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it was clear to him that this was no justification for killing civilian bystanders.  He believes the concept of Jihad is changed by al-Qaeda. The target of Jihad in al-Qaeda is starting world war opposed to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Spying==
Dean decided to leave al-Qaeda going to [[Qatar]] on the pretext of his health with the intention to disappear.  He was captured on arrival in Qatar by Qatari Intelligence, who gave him a choice of intelligence agency and he choose to work with MI6.  MI6 then spent 7 months debriefing him.  At the end of the debriefing in agreed to go back to Afghanistan as a spy.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Dean then spied on al-Qaeda for 8 years prior to being exposed by Washington.  During this time he travelled between Afghanistan and London on behalf of al-Qaeda allowing him to report to MI6, when in the UK he acted as al-Qaeda's representative and had to be careful to preach and recruit with in UK law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Anne Liburd''' '''[[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]''' (1920–2007) also known as '''Ann Liburd''' was a Kittitian women’s rights activist and community organizer. She served as president of the National Council of Women in St. Kitts and was the first and then three-time president of the [[Caribbean Women’s Association]]. She headed several programs to develop women's entrepreneurial skills and then served as the first president of the Federation of Labour Women, a political affiliation of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party]] to help women gain leadership and communication skills.

==Early life==
Anne Eliza Martin was born on 12 December 1920 in [[Antigua]]{{sfn|''SKN Vibes''|21 September 2007}} to Alice Maude (née Cornelius) and Jacob Martin.{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}} Her mother, a staunch supporter of education, was a [[laundress]] and her father engaged in farming.{{sfn|Haniff|2007|p=14}} They were related to the [[Vere Bird|Bird]] family, which had members who served as Prime Ministers in the country. Martin completed her schooling in Antigua{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}} and after high school passed her [[Senior Cambridge|Senior Cambridge Examination]], allowing her to teach.{{sfn|Haniff|2007|p=14}} At the age of 17, Martin gave birth to her first son, [[Clarence Fitzroy Bryant]], who would later serve as St. Kitt's Minister of Education and Attorney General.{{sfn|Conway|2009}} Fitzroy was followed by sons Ronan and Tyrone.{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}}

==Career==
Martin found work in a printing company and during the war years met a [[Nevis]]ian army reservist, Clement Liburd, who she married in 1944.{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}} Two years after her marriage, Liburd and her family, which now included a fourth son, Karl, moved to [[St. Kitts]].{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}}{{sfn|Soares|2009|p=12}} She began teaching at Trinity School,{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}} riding her bicycle daily from her home in [[Basseterre]] to the school in the [[Trinity Palmetto Point Parish|Trinity Parish]].{{sfn|Buchanan|2007}} During this time, she had two more children,{{sfn|St. Kitts National Archives|2010}} a son, Clement Juni Liburd, Jr. who would become Director of Broadcasting for the St. Kitts Nevis Information Service,{{sfn|SKNIS|2004}} and a daughter, [[Marcella Liburd|Marcella]], who later became the Minister of Health, Social Services, Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs.{{sfn|''MIY Vue News''|2011}}

Liburd soon joined the worker's movement providing training for poor women to learn both parenting skills and employment training, guiding them in opening and operating their own businesses. After teaching for several years, she became a civil servant working in the areas of finance and administration. In the 1960s and 1970s, she worked to help develop education policies to improve the opportunities of all children to receive education.{{sfn|''SKN Vibes''|2007}} Liburd was the first president of the [[Caribbean Women’s Association]] (CARIWA),{{sfn|Haniff|2007|p=14}} an umbrella organization formed in 1970 to collectively mobilize and unite women and women's organizations throughout the region,{{sfn|Ellis|2003|p=73}} and was re-elected to the office three times.{{sfn|Haniff|2007|p=14}} During the same period, she served as president of the National Council of Women in St. Kitts{{sfn|''The Virgin Islands Daily News''|1975|p=5}} and during her tenure launched the "Learn to Earn" program which gained acclaim throughout the Caribbean and Canada. The program taught entrepreneurial skills to help women gain economic independence.{{sfn|Qkingdom Ministries Inc.|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Williams|2012}}

In 1974, when the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party|Labour Party]] created the Federation of Labour Women, Liburd was elected as its first president. The following year, she founded the Toast Mistress Club of St. Kitts and Nevis to train women in effective communication skills.{{sfn|Qkingdom Ministries Inc.|2003|p=14}} Throughout the 1970s, Liburd represented the Labour Women at numerous international conferences sponsored by the [[United Nations]]. She attended the inaugural conference for the [[International Women's Year|Decade for Women]] held in [[Mexico City]], the mid-decade conference held in 1985 in [[Copenhagen]]; and was also a representative at the 1990 conference of [[Nairobi]].{{sfn|SKNIS|2004}}{{sfn|Qkingdom Ministries Inc.|2003|p=14}} She kept a black board updated with local events at the Masses House, in an age devoid of talk radio. The board was vandalized and removed many times, but always returned so that Liburd could exercise her right to free speech.{{sfn|''SKN Vibes''|2007}}{{sfn|Williams|2012}}

Between 1982 and 1985, Liburd helped anchor the Trade Union Education Institute and [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) interdisciplinary project to provide training and leadership capacity and teach the history of women’s contributions to society as citizens, activists, laborers, and leaders.{{sfn|Soares|2009|p=13}} From 1985 to 1986, she served as one of the policy makers during the Caribbean Women for Democracy conferences held in [[The Bahamas]], [[Dominica]], and [[Jamaica]].{{sfn|Qkingdom Ministries Inc.|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|''Kingston Gleaner''|1986|p=10}} Liburd was an executive member of the St. Kitts and Nevis Trade and Labour Union, traveling abroad to numerous training events as its representative.{{sfn|Qkingdom Ministries Inc.|2003|p=14}} In 1996, she received membership in the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her community service work.{{sfn|''The Times''|1996|p=7}}

Upon retirement from the civil service, Liburd used her bonus to open a [[Retail#Specialty store|specialty shop]] where she sold [[clothing]], [[toiletries]], [[ginger beer]], and [[mauby]], as well as her own [[Cake|baked goods]]. She used her shop to sell local products and provide income for the women of her community who made the goods.{{sfn|Haniff|2007|p=14}} In 2004, Liburd was honored with a "Woman of Great Esteem" award by the [[Woman of Great Esteem|organization]] of the same name of New York, for her contributions to the development of women's opportunities in St. Kitts and Nevis.{{sfn|SKNIS|2004}}{{sfn|''Kingston Weekly Gleaner''|2003|p=84}}

==Death and legacy==
Liburd died 13 September 2007 in Basseterre, St. Kitts and was buried in the Springfield Cemetery in Basseterre on 25 September 2007.{{sfn|Buchanan|2007}} News of her death led lecturers from UWI to create a series of lectures called ''Forever Indebted to Women'' to highlight the contributions of Caribbean trade women to the history of their countries. The first lecture ''Annstory'' began in St. Kitts and traveled to twelve countries throughout the region,{{sfn|Phillips|2009|p=2}} beginning at the end of 2007.{{sfn|Phillips|2009|p=3}} In 2011, Liburd was featured in an exhibit promoted by various departments of the [[Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis]] to highlight prominent women's accomplishments.{{sfn|''MIY Vue News''|2011}}

[[Image:Samedi.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Baron Samedi.]]
[[Image:CrossOfBaronSamedi.jpg|right|thumb|Cross of Baron Samedi.]]

'''Baron Samedi''' ({{lang-en|Baron Saturday}}) also written '''Baron Samdi''', '''Bawon Samedi''', or '''Bawon Sanmdi''', is one of the [[loa]] of [[Haitian Vodou]]. Samedi is a loa of the dead, along with Baron's numerous other incarnations [[Baron Cimetière]], [[Baron La Croix]], and [[Baron Kriminel]]. He is syncretized with [[Saint Martin de Porres]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

He is the head of the [[Guédé]] family of [[loa]]. His wife is the loa [[Maman Brigitte]].

== Portrayal ==
He is usually depicted with a top hat, black tail coat, dark glasses, and cotton plugs in the nostrils, as if to resemble a corpse dressed and prepared for burial in the Haitian style. He is frequently depicted as a skeleton (but sometimes as a Black man that merely has his face painted as a skull), and speaks in a nasal voice. The former President for Life of Haiti, [[François Duvalier]], modeled his [[cult of personality]] on Baron Samedi; he was often seen speaking in a deep nasal tone and wearing dark glasses.&lt;ref&gt;thedictatorship.com/biographies/papadoc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He is noted for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and having a particular fondness for [[tobacco]] and [[rum]]. Additionally, he is the [[loa]] of [[resurrection]], and in the latter capacity he is often called upon for healing by those near or approaching death, as it is only the Baron that can accept an individual into the realm of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 83, "Baron Samedi"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 83, "&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Samedi spends most of his time in the invisible realm of [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] spirits. He is notorious for his outrageous behavior, swearing continuously and making filthy jokes to the other spirits. He is married to another powerful spirit known as [[Maman Brigitte]], but often chases after mortal women. He loves smoking and drinking and is rarely seen without a cigar in his mouth or a glass of rum in his bony fingers. Baron Samedi can usually be found at the crossroads between the worlds of the living and the dead. When someone dies, he digs their grave and greets their soul after they have been buried, leading them to the underworld.

== Connection to other loas ==
Baron Samedi is the leader of the [[Guédé]], [[loa]] with particular links to magic, ancestor worship and death.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 157, "Ghede"&lt;/ref&gt; These lesser spirits  are dressed like the Baron and are as rude and crude but not nearly as charming as their master.  They help carry the dead to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Creole religions of the Carbbean'', Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert. New York: NYU Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-8147-2720-1}}. Pg. 113 - 114&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
As well as being master of the dead, Baron Samedi is also a giver of life. He can cure any mortal of any disease or wound, if he thinks it is worthwhile. His powers are especially great when it comes to vodou curses and [[black magic]]. Even if somebody has been afflicted by a [[Curse|hex]] that brings them to the verge of death, they will not die if the Baron refuses to dig their grave. So long as this mighty spirit keeps them out of the ground, they are safe.

He also ensures that all corpses rot in the ground to stop any soul from being brought back as a brainless [[zombie]]. What he demands in return depends on his mood. Sometimes he is content with his followers wearing black, white or purple clothes or using sacred objects;{{Citation needed|reason=This just sounds improbable|date=June 2017}} he may simply ask for a small gift of cigars, rum, black coffee, grilled peanuts, or bread. But sometimes the Baron requires a vodou ceremony to help him cross over into this world{{Citation needed|reason=How d o we know this, also some of this list sounds made up, e.g. peanuts and bread some of the time

'''Benny Edward Martin''' (May 8, 1928 - March 13, 2001), was an [[United States|American]] [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddle]]r who invented the 8-string fiddle. Throughout his musical career he performed with artists such as the [[Blue Grass Boys|Bluegrass Boys]], [[Don Reno]], the Smoky Mountain Boys and [[Flatt and scruggs|Flatt and Scruggs]], and later performed and recorded with [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Johnnie &amp; Jack|Johnnie and Jack]], and [[the Stonemans]], among others. 

==Biography==
Born in [[Sparta, Tennessee]] in White County, his father and two of his sisters played music professionally. From childhood, he learned the [[Violin|fiddle]] taught to him by Carl Alverson, Sr., of Sparta and [[ukulele]], as well as the [[guitar]] and in his early teens left home to go to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pursue a full-time career as a [[country music]]ian.

Martin was working at radio station WLAC in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1948 when he was asked to replace [[Bill Monroe]]'s fiddler [[Chubby Wise]] who was going to leave the Bluegrass Boys.&lt;ref name=r78&gt;Rosenberg 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he became a member of Don Reno's Tennessee Cutups. For the next seventeen years, until December 1966, [[Don Reno]] and Martin performed on and off together.&lt;ref name=e30&gt;Ewing 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Martin joined [[Roy Acuff]]'s Smoky Mountain Boys on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], staying with the group until the fall of 1951. During 1951, Martin appeared on all 20 songs at Roy Acuff's last three recording sessions for [[Columbia Records]], playing fiddle, [[mandolin]], guitar, and [[banjo]]. In 1952, he joined [[Flatt and Scruggs]] and the Foggy Mountain Boys cutting eight songs.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Neil V. (1991), Booklet: ''Flatt &amp; Scruggs 1948-1959'', Bear Family BCD 15472&lt;/ref&gt; On these recordings he played with a bluesy and jazzy flavour that complemented Scruggs' playing.&lt;ref name=l135&gt;Lange 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;135.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a tenure with Johnnie and Jack and the Tennessee Mountain Boys, he returned to Monroe's Bluegrass Boys in 1959, but left within a year.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Neil V. (1991), Booklet: ''Bill Monroe: Bluegrass 1959-1969'', Bear Family BCD 15529&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, he toured once again with [[Roy Acuff]] and the Smoky Mountain Boys.&lt;ref name=s95&gt;Schlappi 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a member of [[Grand Ole Opry]] and had his own show, The Benny Martin Show.&lt;ref name=b3&gt;Beisswenger 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Martin performed and recorded with many different artists such as the [[Stanley Brothers]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Johnnie and Jack]], and [[Ernest Stoneman|the Stonemans]]. He recorded at least four singles one for Gulf Reef, "Thinking About Love" and "The Man Next Door" and three for Starday "Hello City Limits" "I'll Never Get Over Loving You", "Pretty Girl" "Dimes Worth of Dreams" and "You are the One" with his wife Joanne "No One But You." He hired [[Colonel Tom Parker]] as his manager and eventually would work as the opening act for some of the early [[Elvis Presley]] concerts.

In 1997, after a long retirement and affliction with [[spasmodic dysphonia]], an illness that affected his ability to talk and sing, Benny emerged to record a two part project entitled "The 'Big Tiger' Roars Again" (Parts 1&amp;2) on OMS Records. Produced by Hugh Moore, the cream of contemporary Bluegrass and Country Music stars that contributed was impressive and included Vince Gill, Jerry Douglas, Ronnie McCoury, Ricky Scaggs, Terry Eldridge, Brian Sutton and Alison Krauss.&lt;ref&gt;OMS Records, www.omsrecords.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin died in 2001 and was interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee]].

==Legacy==
Martin typified the "country stompin'" music, with his enthusiastic fiddling while dancing around on stage. For almost five decades he was a popular entertainer making numerous appearances throughout the United States and Europe. He also recorded a number of records on which he performed on the fiddle and sang vocals. Martin's fiddle style was revolutionary. His recordings with Flatt and Scruggs are among their best, and he's particularly remembered for "Someone Took My Place With You," which exemplifies his unique use of double stops. Martin continues to astonish and influence contemporary fiddlers even now, notably in the style of Michael Cleveland, who's recorded many tunes originated by Martin.

'''Carmen Lind Pettersen''' (6 March 1900–1991) was a [[Guatemalans|Guatemalan]] painter. Known for watercolors of the landscape and traditional costumes of Guatemala and her book, which is the most complete reference work on the textiles of the Guatemalan high plateau. Her works were often listed in Guidebooks for the country and in 1976, she was awarded the [[Order of the Quetzal]] for her artistic merit and has paintings in the permanent collection of the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]].

==Early life==
Carmen Dorotea Gehrke de María y Campos was born and baptized 6 March 1900, in Sagrario Parish, of [[Guatemala City]], Guatemala to María Magdalena Soledad Isabel de María y Campos Hoffmann and Arthur Henry Theodore Gehrke (aka Arturo Enrique Teodoro Gehrke).{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Guatemalan Baptismal Records|1900|p=221}} Her father was a British agent for the import-export company Rosing Brothers and Company, while her mother was from [[Veracruz]], Mexico. When the couple immigrated to Guatemala, they settled with two children, Enelda Francisca and Arthur Richard in the Jocotenango neighborhood of Guatemala City. While in Guatemala, the family grew, adding Carmen and another son, Conrad in 1903. In 1904, Arthur was transferred with Rosing Brothers to London.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}

In 1909, Gehrke entered the [[Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School]], a boarding school, in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], where she began studying painting and developed an interest in nature, spending hours in [[Kew Gardens]].{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} In 1917, she began studying at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] on Regent Street in London. Near the end of the war, she met Leif Lind Pettersen, who was visiting from Guatemala with his uncle Walter Lind.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} Walter Lind (born Lind Pettersen) was an Englishman, born to Norwegian parents, who also worked in Guatemala for Rosing Brothers and owned a coffee plantation.{{sfn|Ones Rosales|2015|p=129}} [[1917 Guatemala earthquake|Earthquakes]] in Guatemala between 1917 and 1918 had devastated the country and in 1923, Arthur was asked to return to the country. He traveled with María and his two daughters, and the family took up residence on one of Walter Lind's farms, known as Helvetia, as Guatemala City was uninhabitable. Gehrke and Leif Lind Pettersen renewed their friendship, which quickly turned into a romance and the couple were married in 1925 in [[Retalhuleu]]. At the time of their marriage, Leif was suffering from [[malaria]] and immediately after the ceremony, Carmen took him to Guatemala City to recover.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

==Career==
After Leif’s recovery, the couple bought a coffee farm known as "La Colonia" near [[El Tumbador]]. They managed it for several years, until 1929 when the plummet in coffee prices due to the [[Great Depression]] forced them to sell and buy a ''[[cinchona]]'' farm known as El Zapote, in the [[Escuintla Department]] on the slopes of the [[Volcán de Fuego]]. This turned out to be a precipitous purchase, as during [[World War II]], the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese captured Indonesia]], cutting off the supply to the seeds of the ''cinchona'', which were needed to make [[quinine]]. The demand and Leif's agreement with the United States government and Merck and Company, soon made their farm one of the largest in the area producing chinchona.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}

In the 1930s, Lind Pettersen began gardening on the farm and painting the landscapes she saw, focusing on the diversity of the trees and flora of the Guatemalan coastal piedmont, which few had painted or studied.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} Her works documented the era of transformation of jungles to rural coffee plantations, showing agricultural migration as well as environmental change.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} Studying design at Kew Gardens, in 1958 with the help of Venancio Tubac Salazar, she created a botanical garden which became the largest in the region.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} It featured three lagoons, which became a haven for migrating coastal [[herons]], as well as large trees which were filled with parrots and other tropical birds. As an observer of her world, she began to study the costumes of the farm workers and domestics that helped on the farm. Noticing that over time the dress styles were changing, Pettersen began to draw and catalogue them. A friend sent her a collection of Mayan costumes, which Pettersen duplicated in watercolor, having her employees and friends pose as models. The work took six years to complete,{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} and she is now known mostly for these watercolors of the traditional costumes of Guatemala.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} In 1976, Lind Pettersen published ''Maya of Guatemala: Vida y Traje/Life and Dress'', a bilingual book, which is the most complete reference work on the textiles of the Guatemalan high plateau.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2017}} That same year, she received the [[Order of the Quetzal]] for her artistic merit of preserving the cultural heritage.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

In 1984, Pettersen began losing her sight{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} and rather than give up art, began teaching. She held an exhibit of her works in 1986 at the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|National School of Visual Arts]]{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} and was listed in guidebooks for Guatemala as a reference for the study of textiles and for her watercolors with works on display in the 1990s at the Ixchel Museum and the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno "Carlos Mérida"]].{{sfn|Koose|1989|pp=40–41}}

==Death and legacy==
Lind Pettersen died in 1991. She has over sixty paintings in the permanent collections of the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]] in Guatemala City. After her death, the garden she developed on their farm became a nature reserve and is opened once a month to the public. In 2017, the Ixchel Museum hosted an exhibit of around thirty of her works throughout the month of February.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

'''Charles Ball''' (April 4, 1819 – March 4, 1903) was the third and fifth [[List of mayors of Chico, California|President of the Chico Board of Trustees]], the governing body of the city of [[Chico, California]] from 1876 to 1879, and from 1882 to 1885. He was a jeweler and watchmaker.

He was the son of Jacob Green Ball from New Jersey and Lucretia Hoyt, from [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]. His mother Lucretia was the third great-granddaughter of [[Walter Hoyt]], one of the founding settlers of Norwalk.

He left from [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] to go west while his wife was still pregnant, and his son, Alanson was only two years old in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1860," index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MDKX-CP4 : accessed 20 Mar 2014), Alanson S Ball in household of Charles Ball, 2nd Ward City Of Marysville, Yuba, California, United States; citing "1860 U.S. Federal Census - Population," Fold3.com; p. 48, household ID 602, NARA microfilm publication M653; FHL microfilm 803072.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;[http://localwiki.net/chico/Charles_Ball Charles Ball entry at Chico Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; He departed from [[New York City]] on a ship that sailed to [[Nicaragua]], where he crossed over land to the Pacific shore.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; From there, he sailed to [[San Francisco|Yerba Buena]] (the early name of San Francisco) arriving in 1849.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt;

He made a return trip in 1850, and he is listed in the 1850 census living in Poughkeepsie on August 20.&lt;ref name="fs-census"/&gt;

He returned again to California, arriving in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; We know he practiced his trade there, presumably relieving miners and prospectors of gold, in exchange for watches and jewelry.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; He is believed to have made at least two more return trips to New York before finally bringing his wife Rebecca and now, three children, to California in late 1857 or early 1858, again by ship/land/ship crossing.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; He chose to relocate to [[Marysville, California|Marysville]], setting up his shop there.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt;

The 1860 Census lists him with three children, in Marysville, Yuba County. He was still in Marysville at the time of Abraham Lincoln's assassination in April 1865. A letter to the Governor, with his signature, is in the California Archives. He was serving as the Adjutant to the Colonel in charge of the [[Marysville Rifles]], a unit of the [[List of California State Militia civil war units|California Militia]]. The letter states the Militia's allegiance to the Union following the assassination, that they were wearing black armbands in mourning and would control and suppress any rabblerousing perpetrated by Confederate sympathizers.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt;

The 1870 Census lists him as residing in Chico. The Charles Ball House (later called the International House) was built in 1869, and is one of the oldest extant structures in the city of Chico. It is one of the Third Street [[Language Houses]] located at 536 West Third Street and used to be owned by [[California State University, Chico]]. It was moved this location in the 1920s. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991, as a contributor to the [[South Campus Neighborhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noehill.com/butte/nat1991000636.aspx?sequence1=year&amp;sequence2=name]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of the Chico Board of Trustees, from 1876 to 1879, and from 1882 to 1885.

'''Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc''' (17 March 1772 – 2 November 1802) was a French Army general who served under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] during the [[French Revolution]]. He was husband to [[Pauline Bonaparte]], sister to Napoleon. In 1801, he was sent to [[Saint-Domingue]] ([[Haiti]]), where an expeditionary force under his command captured and deported the former slave [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], as part of an unsuccessful attempt to reassert imperial control over the Saint-Domingue government. Leclerc died of [[yellow fever]] during the failed expedition.

==Biography==

===To 1801===
Leclerc started his military career in 1791 during the [[French Revolution]] as one of the army volunteers of [[Seine-et-Oise]] and passed through the ranks of [[sous-lieutenant]] in the 12th Cavalry, then aide-de-camp to general [[Jean François Cornu de La Poype|Lapoype]]. He was made a captain and divisional chief of staff during the [[siege of Toulon]], at which he first allied himself to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Following the revolutionary success there, he campaigned along the [[Rhine]].  He began serving under Napoleon Bonaparte in the Alpine and Italian campaigns, fighting at [[Castiglione della Pescaia]] and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]] and rising to [[général de brigade]] in 1797. He was then charged with announcing to the [[French Directory]] the signature of the peace preliminaries at [[Leoben]]. [[Pauline Bonaparte]] was at this time receiving a large number of suitors, thus pressing her brother Napoleon Bonaparte to have her married off. On Leclerc's return, he accepted Bonaparte's offer of Pauline's hand in marriage and they married in 1797, having one child, [[Dermide Leclerc|Dermide]], and occupying the [[Château de Montgobert]].

He became [[chef d'état-major]] to generals [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] and [[Guillaume Marie-Anne Brune|Brune]] and served in the second unsuccessful French Army military expedition to Ireland led by [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert]] in 1798. On Bonaparte's return from the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|Egyptian expedition]] in 1798, he made Leclerc a [[général de division]] and sent him to the [[armée du Rhin]] under [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]]. At this rank Leclerc was able to participate in the [[coup d'etat]] of [[18 Brumaire]] (in November 1799) that made his brother-in-law Napoleon [[First Consul]] of France – supported by [[Joachim Murat|Murat]], he ordered the grenadiers to march into the room of the [[Council of Five Hundred]]. He was next noted for his participation in the Rhine campaign and the [[battle of Hohenlinden]], receiving the supreme command of the 17th, 18th and 19th military divisions. He then passed from that post to being commander-in-chief of an army corps that Napoleon meant to send to [[Portugal]] to force it to renounce its alliance with England, though that expedition never took place.

===Saint-Domingue===
{{Main article|Saint-Domingue expedition}}

In 1791, black slaves in the Caribbean colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] had risen up against their French owners in the [[Haitian Revolution]], which was contemporaneous with the French Revolution. In August 1793, the French Republican commissioner [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] officially abolished slavery on Saint-Domingue, as part of an effort to recruit rebel slaves to the side of the new French Republic. The prominent rebel leader [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], himself a former slave, joined the French Republican side shortly afterwards. By 1801, L'Ouverture had consolidated his rule over the entire island of [[Hispaniola]], including the colony of Saint-Domingue. In July 1801, L'Ouverture promulgated a new constitution for the colony that appointed himself governor for life, while simultaneously reaffirming the colony's position as "part of the French empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=DUBOIS|first=Laurent|last2=Dubois|first2=Laurent|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674034365|location=|pages=243–245|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving the news in October 1801, Napoleon interpreted L'Ouverture's new constitution as an unacceptable offense to French imperial authority, and subsequently appointed Leclerc commander of a military expedition to reconquer Saint-Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe R. Girard, "Liberte, Egalite, Esclavage : French Revolutionary Ideals and the Failure of the Leclerc Expedition to Saint-Domingue," ''French Colonial History,''  Volume 6, 2005, pp. 55–77 {{doi|10.1353/fch.2005.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=DUBOIS|first=Laurent|last2=Dubois|first2=Laurent|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674034365|location=|pages=253–254|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his initial instructions, Bonaparte directed Leclerc to disarm L'Ouverture's black-controlled government and deport his military officers to France, while maintaining the abolition of slavery in Saint-Domingue. Bonaparte also announced intentions to reinstate slavery in neighboring [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Spanish Santo Domingo]], which L'Ouverture had recently occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=DUBOIS|first=Laurent|last2=Dubois|first2=Laurent|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674034365|location=|pages=256–260|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leclerc set off from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in December 1801 and landed at [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]] in February 1802, with other warships and a total of 40,000 troops (including reinforcements, upwards to 80,000 troops were sent to Saint-Domingue during Leclerc's campaign), publicly repeating Bonaparte's promise that "all of the people of Saint-Domingue are French" and forever free. L'Ouverture's harsh discipline had made him numerous enemies and Leclerc played off the ambitions of L'Ouverture's younger key officers and competitors against each other, promising that they would maintain their ranks in the French Army and thus bringing them to abandon L'Ouverture. The French won several victories and regained control in three months after severe fighting, with L'Ouverture forced to negotiate an honorable surrender and to retire to tend his plantations under house-arrest. However, Napoleon had given secret instructions to Leclerc to arrest L'Ouverture, and so Leclerc seized L'Ouverture – during a meeting – for deportation to France, where he died while imprisoned at [[Fort-de-Joux]] in the [[Jura mountains]] in 1803.

Despite his superiors' warnings, Leclerc did not consolidate his victory by disarming L'Ouverture's old officers. After a brief period in which he incorporated many of L'Ouverture's officers into his own forces, Leclerc began suffering mass defections of troops over the latter half of 1802. Those troops, along with the black and Creole population of the colony, rose up in response to news that slavery had been reestablished on [[Guadeloupe]]. The prospect of a similar restoration on Saint-Domingue swung the tide inexorably against French hopes for reimposing control, as Leclerc began executing suspected conspirators en masse.

By October 1802, Leclerc wrote to Bonaparte advocating for a war of extermination, declaring that "We must destroy all the blacks of the mountains – men and women – and spare only children under 12 years of age. We must destroy half of those in the plains and must not leave a single colored person in the colony who has worn an epaulette." In that letter to Bonaparte, Leclerc also lamented his assignment, declaring "My soul is withered, and no joyful thought can ever make forget these hideous scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=DUBOIS|first=Laurent|last2=Dubois|first2=Laurent|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674034365|location=|pages=292|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, more black and [[mulatto]] army officers had defected, including [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]], [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[Henri Christophe]]. After Christophe massacred several hundred Polish soldiers at [[Port-de-Paix]] following his defection, Leclerc ordered the arrest of all remaining black colonial troops in [[Cap-Haïtien|Le Cap]], and executed 1000 of them by tying sacks of flour to their neck and pushing them off the side of ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=DUBOIS|first=Laurent|last2=Dubois|first2=Laurent|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674034365|location=|pages=288–289|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
In November 1802, Leclerc died of [[yellow fever]], which had already decimated his invasion force. His wife Pauline returned to Europe, where she later married the Italian nobleman [[Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona|Camillo Borghese]]. Leclerc was succeeded in command by General [[Vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], whose brutal racial warfare drove more leaders back to the rebel armies. On 18 November 1803, [[François Capois]] defeated Rochambeau's forces in the [[Battle of Vertières]]. Dessalines proclaimed the independence of Haïti and its new name on 1 January 1804. In the meantime Leclerc's body had been transported to France by his widow and buried on one of his estates.

==Memorials==
[[File:Statue leclerc.JPG|thumb|200px|Statue of Leclerc at Pontoise]]
A statue at [[Pontoise]] shows him in Napoleonic uniform, his scabbard touching the earth. It was put up by marshal [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]] and his second wife Louise-Aimée-Julie (Leclerc's sister) at the top of a staircase built in 1869 by François Lemot. Around 3m high, the statue is on a square stone pedestal inscribed with information on him in gold [[majuscule]] letters. It adjoins the south side of city's [[Pontoise Cathedral|cathedral]]. There is also a statue of him by [[Jean Guillaume Moitte]] in the [[Pantheon de Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2369">Dr. '''Jan Constant Janssen''' (18 September 1895 in [[Belgium]], [[Vlimmeren]] &amp;ndash; 15 April 1970 in [[Antwerp]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] physician and businessman. He was the third child (out of four) of Adriaan Victor Janssen (1854&amp;ndash;1942) and Anna Catharina Eelen (1855&amp;ndash;1929). He went to high school in [[Hoogstraten]] and studied medicine at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[University of Ghent]]. On 16 April 1925, he married Margriet Fleerackers ([[Turnhout]], 5 January 1897-[[Vosselaar]], 23 September 1973), together they had four children. Their oldest son, [[Paul Janssen]], would become one of the most successful scientists in pharmaceutics.

==Career==
He started his career as a family physician in [[Turnhout]], but in addition he was interested in business too. In 1921, he met Ladislas Richter in [[Vienna]], who was the son of Gedeon Richter, who owned a pharmaceutical factory in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. In 1933, he acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, [[the Netherlands]] and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the ''N.V. Produkten Richter'' in [[Turnhout]]. In 1937 Constant Janssen acquired an old factory building in the ''Statiestraat 78'' in [[Turnhout]] for his growing company, which he expanded during [[World War II]] into a four-storey building. In 1938 he closed his practice as a family physician and concentrated his effort of the expansion of his pharmaceutical business. His wife managed the production, quality control, and the administration of the company.

Still a medical student, his son Paul Janssen helped with the development of [[Perdolan]]. After [[World War II]], the brandname of the products was changed into ''Eupharma'', and later the company would evolve into [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34784">Despite the extraordinary acclaim that [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s work has received both in Japan and abroad, his films, as well as Kurosawa as an individual, have also been subject to considerable criticism, much of it harsh. It should, however, be noted that, for many of the accusations leveled against the filmmaker's work or his personality that are cited here, commentators taking the contrary view in defense of the director — including Kurosawa himself — have also been cited.

The majority of these negative judgments fall into one or more of the following categories: a) accusations, by European commentators, of insufficient "Japaneseness," particularly compared to the work of the older director, [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]; b) accusations of sentimentality or didacticism; c) criticisms of the (alleged) political stances taken by Kurosawa in his films; d) objections to his films' treatment of women; e) accusations of elitism; f) accusations of pandering directly to the tastes of Western audiences; g) criticisms of his alleged lack of contact (after 1965) with contemporary realities; and h) claims of personal arrogance and mistreatment of colleagues.

Criticism of Kurosawa during his lifetime and in the reception of his legacy have significantly followed the main currents of criticism as they emerged during his lifetime and with the reception of his individual films as they were released in his lifetime. Since the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics belonging to the [[French New Wave]] championed the films of the older Japanese master, [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], at the expense of Kurosawa's work. New Wave critic-filmmaker [[Jacques Rivette]], said: "You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough&amp;nbsp;... [Mizoguchi] seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/beauty_beneath_the_brutality_japanese_masters_mizoguchi_and_ozu_3225 |title=Beauty Beneath the Brutality: Japanese Masters Mizoguchi and Ozu |publisher=moviemaker.com |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between "Japanese" Mizoguchi and "Western" Kurosawa by pointing out that "Mizo" had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa, and that this is reflected in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism frequently directed at Kurosawa's films is that the director's preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] or naïve work. Speaking of the postwar "[[slice of life]]" drama ''One Wonderful Sunday'', for example, film scholar (and future politician) [[Audie Bock]] claimed that not even Kurosawa's celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from [[bathos]]: "The last sequence&amp;nbsp;... is an excruciating twelve minutes of the boy conducting an imaginary orchestra in an empty amphitheater while his girlfriend appeals directly to the camera for the viewer to join in. Angles and focal lengths change, details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut, but nothing makes the scene go any faster."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy exists about the extent to which Kurosawa's films of the Second World War period could be considered propaganda. The cultural historian Peter B. High sees Kurosawa's wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trend of Japan at war and as an example of many of these wartime conventions. High refers to his second film, ''The Most Beautiful'', as a "dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the [home front] genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversy centers on his alleged refusal to acknowledge Japan's wartime guilt. In one of Kurosawa's last films, ''Rhapsody in August'', an elderly survivor of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic attack on Nagasaki]] is visited by her half-Japanese, half-American nephew, Clark ([[Richard Gere]]), who appears (at least to some viewers) to apologize, as an American, for the city's wartime destruction. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote about this film: "A lot of people at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] were outraged that the film makes no mention of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and Japan's atrocities in China&amp;nbsp;... If Clark can apologize for bombing [[Nagasaki]], why can't Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/movies/review-film-kurosawa-small-in-scale-and-blunt.html |title=Review/Film; Kurosawa, Small in Scale and Blunt |author=Canby, Vincent |publisher=nytimes.com |date=December 20, 1991 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawa's movies. Joan Mellen, in her examination of this subject, has maintained that, by the time of ''Red Beard'' (1965), "women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness, but totally bereft of autonomy, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional&amp;nbsp;... Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince concurs with Mellen's view, though less censoriously: "Unlike a male-oriented director like [[Sam Peckinpah]], Kurosawa is not hostile to women, but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japan===
In Japan, both critics and other filmmakers have sometimes accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her commentary on the deluxe [[DVD]] edition of ''Seven Samurai'', Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa "privileging" these samurai, "support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist&amp;nbsp;... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village. Instead, justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours, the peasants must rely on the aristocracy, the upper class, and in particular samurai, to ensure their survival&amp;nbsp;... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth&amp;nbsp;... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Kurosawa's popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the left-wing director [[Nagisa Oshima]] to Kurosawa and his work, states: "That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] to Western values and politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: "He has never catered to a foreign audience" writes Audie Bock, "and has condemned those who do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|1978|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived "arrogant" behavior. It was in Japan that the (initially) disparaging nickname "Kurosawa Tennō"—"The Emperor Kurosawa"—was coined. "Like [[Emperor of Japan|tennō]]", Yoshimoto claimed, "Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world, which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese. The nickname tennō is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self-indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mizoguchi versus Kurosawa dispute==
In the early to mid-1950s, while Kurosawa's films were being widely viewed in Europe and North America, the final films of a Japanese film master of the older generation, Kenji Mizoguchi, also began to be shown internationally and receive film festival prizes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' won an International Award at the 1952 Venice Film Festival and both ''[[Ugetsu]]'' and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' won the Venice Festival Silver Lion (in 1953 and 1954, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003226/awards |title=Kenji Mizoguchi (I) - Awards |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simultaneous exposure led to frequent critical comparisons between the two directors. A number of critics belonging to the [[French New Wave]], such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], championed Mizoguchi's films at the expense of Kurosawa's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since Japanese films appeared on our screens after the war, an aesthetic dispute has ranged the admirers of Kurosawa (''Rashomon'', ''The Seven Samurai'', ''The Idiot'') against those of Mizoguchi. A dispute made even more furious by the fact that both directors have been frequent prizewinners at festivals. Our thanks are due to Jean-José Richer for having cut authoritatively across the debate: "This double distinction awarded in strict equality (to ''The Seven Samurai'' and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff|Sansho Dayu]]'' [''Sansho the Bailiff''], Venice [Film Festival] 1954) is unwarranted… There can be no doubt that any comparison between Mizoguchi and Kurosawa turns irrefutably to the advantage of the former. Alone among the Japanese film-makers known to us, he goes beyond the seductive but minor stage of exoticism to a deeper level where one need no longer worry about false prestige" (Cahiers du Cinéma 40).&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Godard|p=70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Godard|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article, Godard refers to Kurosawa as "merely a more elegant [[Ralph Habib]]",&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Godard|p=70"/&gt; referring to a very obscure contemporary French director who (apparently) specialized in adventure films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352268/ |title=Ralph Habib |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godard's fellow New Wave critic-filmmaker, [[Jacques Rivette]], writes: "You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough. Mizoguchi, alone, imposes a feeling of a unique world and language, is answerable only to himself... He seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/beauty_beneath_the_brutality_japanese_masters_mizoguchi_and_ozu_3225 |title=Beauty Beneath the Brutality: Japanese Masters Mizoguchi and Ozu |publisher=moviemaker.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between "Japanese" Mizoguchi and "Western" Kurosawa: "There were even suggestions by the influential [French film critic] [[André Bazin]] that Mizoguchi represented a more authentic Japaneseness, while Kurosawa was quite obviously influenced by the west, ''as was Mizoguchi'' [emphasis added]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that Kurosawa himself deeply admired the older master, particularly his indefatigable perfectionism. In his eulogy at Mizoguchi's funeral, Kurosawa said, "Mizoguchi's greatness was that he would do anything to heighten the reality of every scene. He never made compromises… Of all Japanese directors, I have the greatest respect for him... With the death of Mizoguchi, Japanese film has lost its truest creator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keenecenter.org/calendars_old/2000S.html |title=The Donald Keene Center of Japanese Culture - Calendar Spring 2000 |publisher=keenecenter.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214620/http://www.keenecenter.org/calendars_old/2000S.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of sentimentality, naïveté and/or didacticism==
A criticism frequently directed at Kurosawa's films is that the director's preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] or naïve work. Speaking of the postwar "[[slice of life]]" drama ''One Wonderful Sunday'', for example, film scholar (and future politician) [[Audie Bock]] claimed that not even Kurosawa's celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from bathos: "The last sequence… is an excruciating twelve minutes of the boy conducting an imaginary orchestra in an empty amphitheater while his girlfriend appeals directly to the camera for the viewer to join in. Angles and focal lengths change, details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut, but nothing makes the scene go any faster."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the Christmas scene in ''Scandal'', when several of the characters go to a tavern and sing [[Auld Lang Syne]] (in Japanese) together, [[Donald Richie]] writes, "… soon all the whores are crying, the band is crying, the drunks are crying, all roaring out the lyrics. The horror of the situation (for this is plainly the genesis of the harrowing night-town sequence of ''Ikiru'') does not occur to the director. Rather, these are good and simple people and this is their moment of truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''Dersu Uzala''—an acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dersu_uzala |title=Dersu Uzala Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] film about an early 20th-century [[Nani people|Nanai]] hunter in the [[Siberia]]n wilderness—scholar Joan Mellen expresses the minority view when she writes: "Kurosawa finds an ideology… in a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] belief in the magnificence of nature and in an embarrassingly archaic, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] adulation of the 'natural man'… But the contrast between the person [Dersu] at one with his surroundings and the world of [[industrialisation|industrialization]], which Kurosawa depicts only in the abstract, is largely theoretical, rendering the work a sentimental journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators claim that Kurosawa can at times be excessively didactic about the ethical points he makes in his films. [[Donald Richie]], speaking of the upright hero of ''[[Red Beard]]'' (a film he otherwise praises highly), writes: "These [wise moral] precepts are known to Dr. Niide before the film opens; they are not revealed to him in the course of the action. As a result ''Red Beard'' contains a didactic quality absent from Kurosawa's finest works, films like ''Ikiru'', which also treat social themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, writing of ''Ran'', claims, "as is often the case in Kurosawa films, some of the remarks by the principal characters… sound naïve, didactic or overstated (e.g., Tango's reproval of Kyoami at the film's close: 'Do not blaspheme! It is the gods who weep. They see us killing each other over and over since time began. They can't save us from ourselves.')"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Yoshimoto also claims that Kurosawa may have created the cynical character of the master swordsman Sanjurō in ''Yojimbo'' as a reaction to this very perception of naïve moralism in the director's earlier work. As Kurosawa depicts him (this scholar claims), Sanjurō, who hires out his services to both corrupt sides in a town feud, does not kill these grotesque characters out of any sense of moral justice, as previous Kurosawa heroes might have done, but merely for the fun of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversies==
During the Second World War, workers on all levels of the Japanese film industry were under immense pressure to create works that not only omitted the slightest criticism of the ruling military dictatorship, but that actively promoted ''kokusaku'' ("national policy"), that is, militarism and other aspects of [[Fascism|fascist]] ideology. It was in this highly politicized atmosphere that Kurosawa began his career as a director in 1943. Therefore, some controversy exists about the extent to which his films of this period could be considered fascist [[propaganda]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Peter B. High's ''The Imperial Screen'' ([[University of Wisconsin Press]], 2003) is the definitive text in English on the subject of Japanese government and military censorship of the film industry before and during the Pacific War. The part of this book from chapter 8 onward deals with the era in which Kurosawa began his directorial career.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural historian Peter B. High sees Kurosawa's wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trends of Japan at war and as an example of many of these conventions. About his second film, ''The Most Beautiful'', which High refers to as a "dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the [home front] genre",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; he writes: "The film announces its [patriotic] spiritist message in the very first scene. Over a loudspeaker, the factory manager (Shimura Takashi) is giving his morning pep talk to the factory personnel: 'Only an indomitable spirit of deep responsibility can achieve outstanding production results. There can be no improvement in production without an improvement in personal character!' The montage cuts back and forth between Shimura and the workers lined up in military fashion. One of the lines is made up of extremely young boys – a depressing sight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|pp=418–419}}&lt;/ref&gt; High also points out that Kurosawa during this period demonstrated "a talent and enthusiasm for national policy scenarios" by writing the blatantly propagandistic 1942 film ''Winged Victory'' (also known as ''A Triumph of Wings'' or ''Victory Song of Wings'') for director [[Satsuo Yamamoto]] and submitting several other scripts that won prizes in "people's cinema script" contests given by the wartime Information Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the films Kurosawa directed after the war have also proved politically controversial. In her negative essay about the (mostly) Soviet-financed ''Dersu Uzala'', Joan Mellen strongly criticizes Kurosawa's apparent acquiescence in what she perceives as "evident Soviet anti-Chinese propaganda." (The film was made during the middle 1970s, when relations between the two [[Communism|Communist]] nations were very tense, particularly regarding the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] region, where the film is set.) For example, in one sequence, Dersu, his friend [[Vladimir Arseniev|Arseniev]] and Arseniev's men find traps that have been laid in the forest for wild animals, in which the animals starve and die, to be later sold for their skins. According to Dersu, this act has been perpetrated by "bad Chinese." These "bad Chinese" also steal the wives of local indigenous men and leave the men to die; in the course of the film, Arseniev finds several such victims and rescues them from certain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative of one of Kurosawa's last films, ''Rhapsody in August'', centers on an elderly survivor of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic attack on Nagasaki]] who is visited by her half-Japanese, half-American nephew, Clark ([[Richard Gere]]), who appears to apologize, as an American, for the city's wartime destruction. Some viewers took Kurosawa to task for criticizing the U.S. while failing to condemn Japanese conduct during the war. Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' wrote: "A lot of people at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] were outraged that the film makes no mention of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and Japan's atrocities in China… If Clark can apologize for bombing [[Nagasaki]], why can't Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/movies/review-film-kurosawa-small-in-scale-and-blunt.html |title=Review/Film; Kurosawa, Small in Scale and Blunt |author=Canby, Vincent |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1991-12-20 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference during the Cannes Film Festival, Kurosawa, Canby reported, denied that he was trying to absolve the wartime Japanese government of responsibility: "'We Japanese,' [Kurosawa] said, 'were also the victims of Japanese militarism.' The subject of the film, he insisted, is not guilt and responsibility but the horrors of war, in particular of the bomb, which has made possible the absolute end of everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9807E0D7123AF93AA25756C0A967958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Rhapsody%20in%20August&amp;st=cse |title=Movie Review – Rhapsody in August (1991) – Madonna and the Master at Cannes |author=Canby,Vincent |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1991-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to depictions of women==
A number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawa's movies. (Kurosawa himself once noted: "Of course, all my women [in my films] are rather strange, I agree.")&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Mellen, in her examination of this subject, praises only the director's characterization of Yukie (Setsuko Hara), the heroine of ''No Regrets for Our Youth'', remarking that "her face expresses the very potential of the Japanese woman that has been so often, during all these long centuries, left wasted and latent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the main female character in ''Rashomon'', Masago, Mellen claims that "in none of the versions [of the film's self-contradictory narrative] is the woman (Machiko Kyo) granted self-respect, dignity or spiritual value," and argues that Masago represents one aspect of a "whore-madonna" dichotomy on the part of her creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellen also claims that, after ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa stopped portraying women's potential in his works "as if repelled by Masago, that half-demon of his own creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; She maintains that many of Kurosawa's later heroines fall into one of two categories: the destructive and the masochistic woman. Speaking of ''The Idiot'', she wrote, "the sensual woman is portrayed as the castrating bitch and the 'good' girl is devoid of any capacity for pleasure." In the Gorky adaptation, ''The Lower Depths'', one heroine is "manipulative and malicious," and the other is "weak and unable to survive on her own."&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of ''Red Beard'' (1965), "women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness, but totally bereft of autonomy, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional… Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover."&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53"/&gt;

Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto has noted that Kurosawa's films often offer a paradoxical bond between good and evil male protagonists, in which the distinction between them becomes blurred. Outside this "[[Möbius strip]] of male bonding," any woman "functions as a catalyst of sentimentalism by neutralizing" this duality. "Without being able to produce any value by herself," Yoshimoto writes, "the woman in Kurosawa's films is often the embodiment of passivity threatening the solipsism of the split male subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa scholar [[Stephen Prince]] concurs with the above views, though less censoriously: "Kurosawa's is a world of men, and his interests are not piqued by the sexuality or the psychology of men and women in relation to each other… Unlike a male-oriented director like Sam Peckinpah, Kurosawa is not hostile to women, but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged elitism==
In Japan, critics and other filmmakers, conscious of Kurosawa's samurai background, have sometimes accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In one scene in ''Yojimbo'', the samurai anti-hero Sanjurō, having reneged on his agreement to fight for one of two factions in a feuding town, retreats to a high watchtower to watch, with considerable amusement, the two sides battle it out. This scene greatly offended the filmmaker [[Masahiro Shinoda]], who interpreted the samurai's climb into the watchtower as symbolic of the director's detached, above-it-all attitude towards the chaotic social conditions he was depicting in the film.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Prince|pp=248-249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yojimbo|loc=Stephen Prince commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her commentary on the deluxe DVD edition of ''Seven Samurai'', Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa "privileging" these samurai, "support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village. Instead, justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours, the peasants must rely on the aristocracy, the upper class, and in particular samurai, to ensure their survival… Tadao Sato, in particular, objected to Kurosawa's view that only a handful of people are great... Worst of all, the farmers are too stupid. Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth… It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=Joan Mellen commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2008|pp=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accusations of pandering to Western audiences==
Because of Kurosawa's popularity with Western audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] director [[Nagisa Oshima]] to Kurosawa and his work, states: "That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be pandering to Western values and politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2008|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: "He has never catered to a foreign audience" writes Audie Bock, "and has condemned those who do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did concede in an interview that part of the reason he employed dynamic "Western" stylistic elements in his films was to attract the young ''Japanese'' audience of that time. Japanese youth (in the director's view) often preferred the exciting styles of American and European films and were ignorant of or indifferent to their native history and culture. "In order for them to understand I have to translate, as it were… [In ''Seven Samurai''] under Mifune's scenes, I had [composer Fumio] Hayasaka put in a [[Mambo (music)|mambo]]. If purely Japanese music had been used I don't think the young people would have felt what that character was like, how much he resembled them… Oh, I'm Japanese all right. I'm truly Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged lack of contact with contemporary realities==
Several critics maintain that sometime around the mid-1960s, Kurosawa appeared to lose touch with (or perhaps interest in) the contemporary sociopolitical realities of Japan. Writes Stephen Prince: "The tide of popular activism [in 1960s Japan] is relevant to ''Red Beard'' and to the films that followed because of its glaring absence from their narratives and concerns, because of the adamant refusal by these films to believe that society could be made better… By contrast [with the Japanese New Wave filmmakers], with evidence readily at hand of democratic protest in modern Japan… Kurosawa chose in his work to retreat to the past and to mythical spaces. The resurgent pessimism of the late films is defiant indeed."&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Prince|pp=248-249"/&gt;

Audie Bock, writing in 1978, claims that the humanist ideology that sustained the director during previous decades was no longer relevant: "By the time ''Red Beard'' was released, in 1965, the postwar era of values like 'humanism,' 'culture' and 'democracy' was over. Those who still flock to see it today do so not because it says something about contemporary Japan, but because it is a kind of summary statement of Kurosawa's values and technical virtuosity… it is the alienation of contemporary society from humanistic values that accounts for [his later films'] feeling of didactic remoteness… The shantytown atmosphere of ''Dodeskaden'' is hard to find in contemporary wealthy Japan, and the man in unspoiled nature represented by Dersu [Uzala] is hard to find anywhere in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues==
During his lifetime, Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived "arrogant" behavior. "Particularly in Japan," writes Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, "it is not unusual to find what is supposed to be a review or criticism of his films lapsing into a critic's personal commentary, impressions, or attack on Kurosawa as a director or as a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Japan that the (initially) disparaging nickname "Kurosawa Tennō" – "The Emperor Kurosawa" – was coined. "Like [[Emperor of Japan|tennō]]," Yoshimoto claimed, "Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world, which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese. The nickname tennō is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self-indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sets of his productions, Kurosawa acquired a reputation as a stern taskmaster and even, for some, a dictator. It is well documented that, during the shooting of ''Seven Samurai'', he was particularly harsh to [[Yoshio Inaba]], the actor who played Gorobei, Kambei's second-in-command,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20070118i1.html |title=In the presence of 'Emperor' Kurosawa - The Japan Times Online |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=Donald Richie commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Inaba subsequently appeared in only one other film for the director (''Throne of Blood'') in a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408343 |title=Yoshio Inaba (IMDB page) |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He could even sometimes be hard on seasoned, highly respected film professionals. During the filming of ''Yojimbo'', he lost his temper with cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]], who has been called "quite simply, Japan's preeminent cinematographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/miyagawa.htm |title=KAZUO MIYAGAWA |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when one of Miyagawa's assistants asked him, "Why don't you get angry when Kurosawa yells at you?" Miyagawa answered, "Look at Kurosawa. He devotes himself completely to his work. No other director works so hard to achieve the ideal shot he has envisioned in his mind. I have no right to say anything to someone like him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yojimbo|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create! – The Birth of the Super-Samurai Action Film (Yojimbo)'' - Crew Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David'''{{efn|({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|v|ᵻ|d}}; {{Hebrew Name|{{hebrew|דָּוִד}}|Davīd|Dāwīḏ}}; {{lang-grc|Δαυίδ|Davíd}}; {{lang-la|Davidus, David}}; {{lang-gez|ዳዊት}}, ''Dawit''; {{lang-xcl|Դաւիթ}}, ''Dawitʿ''; {{lang-cu|Давíдъ}}, ''Davidŭ''; possibly meaning "beloved one"&lt;ref name="BotterweckRinggren1977"&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. Johannes Botterweck|author2=Helmer Ringgren|title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBUH0Znxbb8C&amp;pg=PA158|year=1977|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2327-4|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}} is described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the second king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]].

In the [[Books of Samuel|biblical narrative]], David is a young shepherd who first gains fame as a musician and later by killing [[Goliath]]. He becomes a favorite of King [[Saul]] and a [[David and Jonathan|close friend]] of Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]]. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is [[Anointing|anointed]] as King. David conquers [[Jerusalem]], taking the [[Ark of the Covenant]] into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David commits adultery with [[Bathsheba]], leading him to arrange the death of her husband [[Uriah the Hittite]]. Because of this sin, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple, and his son [[Absalom]] tries to overthrow him. David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel. Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son [[Solomon]] as successor. He is honored in the [[Nevi'im|prophetic literature]] as an ideal king and an ancestor of a future [[Messiah]], and many [[psalms]] are ascribed to him.

Historians of the [[Ancient Near East]] agree that David probably existed around 1000 BCE, but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure. There is no direct evidence outside of the Bible concerning David, but the [[Tel Dan Stele]], an inscribed stone erected by a king of [[Damascus]] in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase {{Hebrew|ביתדוד}}, ''bytdwd'', consisting of the Hebrew words "house" and "David", which most scholars translate as "[[Davidic line|House (Dynasty) of David]]".  Ancient Near East historians generally doubt that the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]] as described in the Bible existed.

David is richly represented in post-biblical Jewish written and oral tradition, and is discussed in the [[New Testament]]. [[Early Christians]] interpreted the life of [[Jesus]] in light of the references to the Messiah and to David; Jesus is described as being descended from David.  David is discussed in the [[Quran]] and figures in Islamic oral and written tradition as well. The biblical character of David has inspired many interpretations in fictional literature over centuries.

==Biblical account==
===Family===
[[File:Sweet stories of God; in the language of childhood and the beautiful delineations of sacred art (1899) (14751566596).jpg|thumb|David raises the head of Goliath as illustrated by [[Josephine Pollard]] (1899)]]
The [[1 Samuel|first book of Samuel]] portrays David as the youngest of the eight sons of [[Jesse]] of Bethlehem. His mother is not named in any book of the Bible, but the [[Talmud]] identifies her as [[Nitzevet]] daughter of Adael.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Tractate Bava Batra 91a&lt;/ref&gt; When the story was retold in 1 Chronicles (4th century BCE) he was made the youngest of seven sons and given two sisters, [[Zeruiah]] and [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail]]. The [[Book of Ruth]] (possibly also 4th century BCE) traces his ancestry back to [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] the Moabite.

David is described as cementing his relations with various political and national groups through [[Marriage of state|marriage]].&lt;ref name=Lemaire&gt;Lemaire, Andre (1999). In Hershel Shanks, ed., ''Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple''. Biblical Archaeology Society; Revised edition, {{ISBN|978-1880317549}}&lt;/ref&gt;   King [[Saul]] initially offered David his oldest daughter [[Merab]]. David did not refuse the offer, but humbled himself in front of Saul to be considered among the King's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Samuel 18:18|url=http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-18.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul reneged and instead gave Merab in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Samuel 18:19|url=http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having been told that his younger daughter [[Michal]] was in love with David, Saul gave her in marriage to David upon David's payment in [[Philistine]] foreskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Samuel 18:18-27|url=http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-27.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul became jealous of David and tried to have him killed. David escaped. Then Saul sent Michal to Galim to marry [[Palti, son of Laish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Samuel 25:14|url=http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; David then took wives in [[Hebron]], according to [[2 Samuel]] 3; they were [[Ahinoam]] the Yizre'elite, [[Abigail]] - the wife of Nabal the Carmelite, [[Maacah]] - the daughter of Talmay, king of [[Geshur]], [[Haggith]], [[Abital]], and [[Eglah]].  Later, David wanted Michal back and Saul's son Ish-boshet delivered her to David, causing her husband (Palti) great grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-14.htm|title=2 Samuel 3:14|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Chronicles]] lists his sons with his various wives and [[concubine]]s. In [[Hebron]], David had six sons: [[Amnon]], by [[Ahinoam]]; [[Daniel (son of David)|Daniel]], by [[Abigail]]; [[Absalom]], by [[Maachah]]; [[Adonijah]], by [[Haggith]]; [[Shephatiah]], by [[Abital]]; and [[Ithream]], by [[Eglah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1–3|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Bathsheba, his sons were [[Shammua]], Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] and [[Solomon]]. David's sons born in Jerusalem of his other wives included [[Ibhar]], Elishua, [[Eliphelet]], Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama and Eliada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel|5:14–16|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerimoth]], who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles|11:18|NIV}}. His daughter [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], by Maachah, is a key character in the incident of her rape by one of her half-brothers.

===Narrative===
{{anchor|childhood|Jesse|Bethlehem|Saul rejected}}
[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], 3rd century CE]]
[[Yahweh|God]] is angered when [[Saul]], Israel's king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|13:8–14|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later disobeys a divine command both to kill all of the [[Amalek]]ites and to destroy their confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|15:1–28|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God sends the [[prophet]] Samuel to anoint a shepherd, David, the youngest son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]], to be king instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|16:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|At Saul's court}}
After God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul, his courtiers recommend that he send for David, a man skillful on the lyre, wise in speech, and brave in battle. David thus enters Saul's service as one of the royal armour-bearers and plays the lyre to soothe the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|16:14–23|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|David and Goliath}}
War comes between Israel and the [[Philistines]], and the giant [[Goliath]] challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:1–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul's army, declares that he can defeat Goliath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:17–37|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing the king's offer of the royal armour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:38–39|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; he kills Goliath with his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:49–50|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul inquires the name of the young hero's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:55–56|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jusepe Leonardo 001.jpeg|thumb|Saul threatening David, by [[José Leonardo]]]]
Saul sets David over his army. All Israel loves David, but his popularity causes Saul to fear him ("What else can he wish but the kingdom?").&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|18:5–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul plots his death, but Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], one of those who [[David and Jonathan|loves David]], warns him of his father's schemes and David flees. He goes first to [[Nob (Bible)|Nob]], where he is fed by the priest [[Ahimelech]] and given Goliath's sword, and then to [[Gath (city)|Gath]], the Philistine city of Goliath, intending to seek refuge with King [[Achish]] there. Achish's servants or officials question his loyalty, and David sees that he is in danger there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|21:10–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes next to the cave of [[Adullam]], where his family join him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he goes to seek refuge with the king of [[Moab]], but the prophet [[Gad (prophet)|Gad]] advises him to leave and he goes to the [[Forest of Hereth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to [[Keilah]], where he is involved in a further battle with the Philistines. Saul plans to besiege Keilah so that he can capture David, so David leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:1–13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he takes refuge in the mountainous [[Ziph (Judean Mountains)|Wilderness of Ziph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|David and Jonathan}}
Jonathan meets with David again and confirms his loyalty to David as the future king.  After the people of Ziph notify Saul that David is taking refuge in their territory, Saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture David in the Wilderness of Maon, but his attention is diverted by a renewed Philistine invasion and David is able to secure some respite at [[Ein Gedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:27–29|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from battle with the Philistines, Saul heads to Ein Gedi in pursuit of David and enters the cave where, as it happens, David and his supporters are hiding, "to attend to his needs". David realises he has an [[Window of opportunity|opportunity]] to kill Saul, but this is not his intention: he secretly cuts off a corner of Saul's robe, and when Saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to Saul as the king and to demonstrate, using the piece of robe, that he holds no malice towards Saul. The two are thus reconciled and Saul recognises David as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|24:1–22|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar passage occurs in 1 Samuel 26, when David is able to infiltrate Saul's camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep. In this account, David is advised by [[Abishai (biblical figure)|Abishai]] that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not "stretch out [his] hand against the Lord's anointed".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue David and blesses him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:25|NIV}}, NIV text&lt;/ref&gt;

A different tradition is recalled in {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|27:1–4|NKJV}}, namely that Saul ceased to pursue David because David took refuge a second time with Achish, the Philistine king of Gath.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|21:10–15|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achish permits David to reside in [[Ziklag]], close to the border between Gath and Judea, from where he leads raids against the [[Geshur]]ites, the Girzites and the [[Amalek]]ites, but leads Achish to believe he is attacking the Israelites in Judah, the [[Jerahmeelite]]s and the [[Kenite]]s. Achish believes that David had become a loyal [[vassal]], but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of Gath, and at their request Achish instructs David to remain behind to guard the camp when the Philistines march against Saul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|29:1–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David returns to Ziklag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|30:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan and Saul are killed in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|31:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David is anointed king over Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|2:1–4|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, Saul's son [[Ish-Bosheth]] is anointed king of Israel, and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|2:8–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Proclaimed king|Jerusalem and the Davidic covenant}}
With the death of Saul's son, the elders of Israel come to [[Hebron]] and David is anointed king over all of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|5:1–3|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conquers [[Jerusalem]], previously a [[Jebusite]] stronghold, and makes it his capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|5:6–7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brings the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|6:1–12|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending to build a temple for God, but the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of David's sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|7:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David stating, "your throne shall be established forever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|7:16|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David wins additional victories over the Philistines, Moabites, [[Edomites]], Amalekites, [[Ammon]]ites and king [[Hadadezer]] of [[Aram-Zobah]], after which they become tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|8:1–14|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Samuel]] calls David a skillful harp (lyre) player&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Samuel|16:15–18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the sweet psalmist of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Other translations say, "the hero of Israel's songs," "the favorite singer of Israel," "the contented psalm writer of Israel," and "Israel's beloved singer of songs." [http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm 2 Samuel 23:1].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while almost half of the [[Psalms]] are headed "A Psalm of David" (also translated as "to David" or "for David") and tradition identifies several with specific events in David's life (e.g., [[Psalm 3|Psalms 3]], [[Psalm 7|7]], [[Psalm 18|18]], [[Psalm 34|34]], [[Psalm 51|51]], [[Psalm 52|52]], [[Psalm 54|54]], [[Psalm 56|56]], [[Psalm 57|57]], [[Psalm 59|59]], [[Psalm 60|60]], [[Psalm 63|63]] and [[Psalm 142|142]]),&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on II Samuel 22, The Anchor Bible, Vol. 9.

The [[Tel Dan Stele]], an inscribed stone erected by a [[Aram-Damascus|king of Damascus]] in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase {{Hebrew|ביתדוד}}, ''bytdwd'', which most scholars translate as "House of David".{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=180}} Other scholars, such as [[Anson Rainey]] have challenged this reading,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] which traced its ancestry to a founder named David.{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=180}} The [[Mesha Stele]] from [[Moab]], dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name David in two places, although this is less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription.{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=210, fn.18}} 
[[File:Karnak Tempel 19.jpg|thumb|200px|The Triumphal Relief of [[Shoshenq I]] near the [[Bubastite Portal]] at [[Karnak]], depicting the god [[Amun-Re]] receiving a list of cities and villages conquered by the king in his Near Eastern military campaigns.]]
Besides the two steles, bible scholar and egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]] suggests that David's name also appears in a relief of Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shoshenq]] (usually identified with [[Shishak]] in the Bible, 1 Kings 14:25-27).&lt;ref name="Phar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mckenzie-david.html|title=King David: A Biography (excerpt)|website=[[The New York Times]]|author=McKenzei, Steven L.}} 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The relief claims that Shoshenq raided places in Palestine in 925 BCE, and Kitchen interprets one place as "Heights of David", which was in Southern Judah and the [[Negev]]  where the Bible says David took refuge from Saul. The relief is damaged and interpretation is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Phar"/&gt;

Apart from these, all that is known of David comes from the biblical literature. The [[Books of Samuel]] were substantially composed during the time of King [[Josiah]] at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the [[Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE), and substantially complete by about 550 BCE, although further editing was done even after then—the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 "almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period".{{sfn|Auld|2003|p=219}} The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the "history of David's rise" (1 Samuel 16:14–2 Samuel 5:10), and the "succession narrative" (2 Samuel 9–20 and 1 Kings 1–2).{{sfn|Knight|1991|p=853}} The [[Books of Chronicles|Book of Chronicles]], which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350–300 BCE, and uses Samuel as its source.{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=32}}

The authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=232–233}}  The [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence indicates that in the 10th century BCE, the time of David, Judah was sparsely inhabited and Jerusalem was no more than a small village; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chiefdom to a kingdom, but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] to the north.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2007|pp=26–27}} The biblical evidence likewise indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him ''negid'', for example, meaning "prince" or "chief", rather than ''melek'', meaning "king"; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs (even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around [[Hebron]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=220–221}}

Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. The late [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]], in his ''History of Israel'' (1981), takes Samuel at face value. [[Donald B. Redford]], however, sees all reconstructions from biblical sources for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] period as examples of "academic wishful thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp. 301–307.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas L. Thompson]] rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative: "The history of Palestine and of its peoples is very different from the Bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be. An independent history of Judea during the Iron I and Iron II periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of I-II Samuel and I Kings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Thompson TL|title= A view from Copenhagen: Israel and the History of Palestine|url= http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/copenhagen.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amihai Mazar]] however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in [[City of David]], [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], [[Tel Dan]], [[Tel Rehov]], [[Khirbet en-Nahas]] and others "the deconstruction of United Monarchy and the devaluation of Judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data". According to Mazar, based on archeological evidences, the [[United Monarchy]] can be described as a "state in development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Mazar A|title= Archaeology and the biblical Narrative: The Case of the United Monarchy|url= http://www.rehov.org/Rehov/publications/Mazar%20-%20The%20United%20%20Monarchy-BZAW2010.pdf|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140611170411/http://www.rehov.org/Rehov/publications/Mazar%20-%20The%20United%20%20Monarchy-BZAW2010.pdf|archivedate= 2014-06-11|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies of David have been written: [[Baruch Halpern]] has pictured David as a lifelong vassal of [[Achish]], the Philistine king of Gath;&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Halpern, "David's Secret Demons", 2001. [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/1551_3721.pdf Review of Baruch Halpern's "David's Secret Demons"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of Samuel those chapters which describe David as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein and Silberman, "David and Solomon", 2006. See review [http://www.archaeology.org/0601/reviews/kings.html "Archaeology" magazine].&lt;/ref&gt; Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible at [[Rhodes College]] and author of ''King David: A Biography'', argues that David came from a wealthy family, was "ambitious and ruthless" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons.&lt;ref name="McKenzie_on_David" /&gt;

Critical Bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of David's rise to power is a political apology—an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Historical David: The Real Life of an Invented Hero|last=Baden|first=Joel|date=2014-07-29|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=9780062188373}}&lt;!--|access-date=2015-03-02--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman reject the idea that David ruled over a united monarchy, suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of Judah, much smaller than the northern kingdom of Israel at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Finkelstein|first1= Israel|last2= Silberman|first2= Neil Asher|title= The Bible Unearthed.

(Finkelstein and Silberman 2002: 181).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob L. Wright]], Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University, has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods.&lt;ref&gt;

==History of interpretation in the Abrahamic religions==
===Rabbinic Judaism===
David is an important figure in [[Rabbinic Judaism]], with many legends around him. According to one tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

David's adultery with Bathsheba is interpreted as only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to Talmudic sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&amp;letter=D#260|title=David |website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.  God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin|page=107a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[midrashim]], [[Adam]] gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Bereishis 91b&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the [[Talmud Yerushalmi]], David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]] (Feast of Weeks). His piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The concept of the Messiah is important in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title [[Messiah]] had it), the "son of David" became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus "by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David "David"] article from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The early Church believed that "the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|the Good Shepherd]]; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]]; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, [[Ahitophel|Achitophel]], and the passage over the [[Kidron Valley|Cedron]] remind us of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Sacred Passion]].

In European [[Christian culture]] of the [[Middle Ages]], David was made a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]]. His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.

David was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of [[Divine right of kings|divinely-ordained monarchy]] throughout medieval Western Europe and Eastern Christendom. David was perceived as the biblical predecessor to Christian Roman and Byzantine emperors and the name "New David" was used as an honorific reference to these rulers.&lt;ref name=Garipzanov&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garipzanov|first1=Ildar H.|title=The Symbolic Language of Royal Authority in the Carolingian World (c. 751–877)|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004166691|pages=128, 225|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] [[Bagrationi|Bagratids]] and the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Empire of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] claimed a direct [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|biological descent]] from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapp|first=Stephen H., Jr. |title=Imagining History at the Crossroads: Persia, Byzantium, and the Architects of the Written Georgian Past |date=1997|publisher=Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan|page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, kings of the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Carolingian dynasty]] frequently connected themselves to David; [[Charlemagne]] himself occasionally used the name of David as his pseudonym.&lt;ref name=Garipzanov/&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|David in Islam}}
David is an important figure in [[Islam]] as one of the major [[prophet]]s sent by [[God]] to guide the [[Israelites]]. David is mentioned several times in the [[Quran]] with the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name داود, ''Dāwūd'', often with his son [[Solomon]]. In the Qur'an: David killed Goliath (2:251), a giant soldier in the Philistine army. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it (38:20). David was made God's "[[vicegerent]] on earth" (38:26) and God further gave David sound judgment (21:78; 37:21–24, 26) as well as the [[Psalms]], regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55). The birds and mountains united with David in uttering praise to God (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while God made iron soft for David ([http://quran.com/34/10, 34:10]), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron ([http://quran.com/21/80 21:80]); an indication of the first use of [[wrought iron]], this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his [[bronze]] and [[cast iron]]-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and David judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21–23). Since there is no mention in the Qur'an of the wrong David did to [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] nor any reference to [[Bathsheba]], [[Muslim]]s reject this narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Brannon M. (''The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "David"&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim [[tradition]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' stress David's zeal in daily prayer as well as in [[fasting]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dawud". ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' elaborate upon David's concise Qur'anic narratives and specifically mention David's gift in singing his Psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, "Story of David"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--(In chronological order)--&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:081.David Mourns the Death of Absalom.jpg|thumb|200px|David mourning the death of Absalom, by Gustave Doré]]
Literary works about David include:
* '''1681–82''' [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s long poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' is an allegory that uses the story of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] against King David as the basis for his satire of the contemporary political situation, including events such as the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] (1685), the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]].
* '''1893''' [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] may have used the story of David and Bathsheba as a foundation for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]''. Holmes mentions "the small affair of Uriah and Bathsheba" at the end of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C2IpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291&amp;dq=%22The+Crooked+Man%22+bathsheba#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The+Crooked+Man%22+bathsheba&amp;f=false|title=The Sherlock Holmes Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained|first=|last=DK|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|accessdate=12 February 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780241248331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1928''' [[Elmer Davis]]'s novel ''Giant Killer'' retells and embellishes the biblical story of David, casting David as primarily a poet who managed always to find others to do the "dirty work" of heroism and kingship. In the novel, [[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan]] in fact killed Goliath but David claimed the credit; and [[Joab]], David's cousin and general, took it upon himself to make many of the difficult decisions of war and statecraft when David vacillated or wrote poetry instead.
* '''1936''' [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' refers to the story of Absalom, David's son; his rebellion against his father and his death at the hands of David's general, Joab. In addition it parallels Absalom's vengeance for the rape of his sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]] by his half-brother, [[Amnon]].
* '''1946''' [[Gladys Schmitt]]'s novel ''David the King'' was a richly embellished biography of David's entire life. The book took a risk, especially for its time, in portraying David's relationship with Jonathan as overtly [[homoerotic]], but was ultimately panned by critics as a bland rendition of the title character.
* '''1966''' [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], a Dominican political leader and writer, wrote ''David: Biography of a King'', as a realistic portrayal of David's life and political career.
* '''1970''' [[Dan Jacobson]]'s ''The Rape of Tamar'' is an imagined account, by one of David's courtiers Yonadab, of the rape of Tamar by Amnon.
* '''1972''' [[Stefan Heym]] wrote ''The King David Report'' in which the historian [[Ethan (biblical figure)|Ethan]] compiles upon King Solomon's orders "a true and authoritative report on the life of David, Son of Jesse"—the East German writer's wry depiction of a court historian writing an "authorized" history, many incidents clearly intended as satirical references to the writer's own time.
* '''1974''' In [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s biblical fantasy novel ''How are the Mighty Fallen'', David and Jonathan are explicitly stated to be lovers. Moreover, Jonathan is a member of a winged semi-human race (possibly [[nephilim]]), one of several such races coexisting with humanity but often persecuted by it.
* '''1980''' [[Malachi Martin]]'s [[Faction (literature)|factional]] novel ''King of Kings: A Novel of the Life of David'' relates the life of David, Adonai's champion in his battle with the Philistine deity Dagon.
* '''1984''' [[Joseph Heller]] wrote a novel based on David called ''[[God Knows (novel)|God Knows]]'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Told from the perspective of an aging David, the humanity—rather than the heroism—of various biblical characters is emphasized. The portrayal of David as a man of flaws such as greed, lust, selfishness, and his alienation from God, the falling apart of his family is a distinctly 20th-century interpretation of the events told in the Bible.
* '''1993''' [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''Certain Women'' explores family, the Christian faith, and the nature of God through the story of King David's family and an analogous modern family's saga.
* '''1995''' [[Allan Massie]] wrote ''King David'', a novel about David's career that portrays the king's relationship to Jonathan as sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Kane|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Exum|editor1-first=Jo Cheryl|title=Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUd28eEXGfoC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%22allan%20massie%22%20%22king%20david%22&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q=massie%20jonathan&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 August 2015|chapter=The Biblical King David and His Artistic and Literary Afterlives|isbn=978-9004112902|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2015''' [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] wrote a novel about King David, ''[[The Secret Chord]]'', told from the point of view of the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Matthew|title='The Secret Chord' by Geraldine Brooks |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2015/10/03/book-review-the-secret-chord-geraldine-brooks/5XqipZWUj40EQVoerjtQmO/story.html |accessdate=4 October 2015|work=Boston Globe|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Alice|title=Geraldine Brooks reimagines King David's life in 'The Secret Chord'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/geraldine-brooks-reimagines-king-davids-life-in-the-secret-chord/2015/09/28/e0a4a69c-62de-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the [[King of Spades]] was often known as "David".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/history/world/cardking.asp|title=snopes.com: Four Kings in Deck of Cards|website=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/cards.html "Courts on playing cards"], by David Madore, with illustrations of the Anglo-American and French court cards&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Faherty''' (also known as ''Micheál Ó Fátharta''; 1934–2010) was a 76-year-old man who was found burned to death in the living room of his home at Clareview Park, Ballybane, [[County Galway|Galway]], on 22 December 2010. His body was partly consumed by a fire that was driven by the [[wick effect]], which commonly occurs near, and is aided by,  an open fireplace.  His death was recorded as "spontaneous combustion" by the coroner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15032614 |title=BBC News – 'First Irish case' of death by spontaneous combustion |publisher=BBC |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident and Inquest==
In the early hours of 22 December 2010, Faherty's neighbour, a Mr Mannion, was awakened by the sound of his smoke alarm. Mannion went outside to find heavy smoke coming from Faherty's house. Getting no answer from Faherty's house, he roused local residents and the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] and the fire brigade was called.

Faherty's home was searched by forensic experts from the Gardaí and the fire service. Faherty's body had been found lying on his back with his head closest to an open fireplace. The fire had been entirely confined to the sitting room and the only damage found was to the totally burnt body, the ceiling above and the floor beneath him. No trace of any accelerants was found and there was nothing to suggest foul play had taken place. Assistant chief fire officer Gerry O'Malley told the inquest into the death that after a thorough investigation, fire officers were satisfied that the open fire was not the cause of the blaze which led to Faherty's death.

A post-mortem carried out by [[pathologist]] Grace Callagy noted that Faherty had suffered from [[Type 2 diabetes]] and [[hypertension]] but had not died from heart failure. Callagy concluded that "The extensive nature of the burns sustained precludes determining the precise cause of death."&lt;ref name="galwaynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwaynews.ie/21713-galway-pensioner-died-spontaneous-combustion |title=Galway City Tribune – Galway pensioner died from spontaneous combustion 
 |publisher=galwaynews.ie|date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the west Galway [[coroner]], Dr Ciaran McLoughlin, informed the inquiry into the death that he searched medical literature to determine the cause of death. The coroner referred to Professor Bernard Knight's book on forensic pathology, which states that a high number of alleged incidents of [[spontaneous human combustion]] had taken place near an open fireplace or chimney.&lt;ref name="galwaynews1" /&gt;

The coroner subsequently made a statement to an inquiry: "This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ensor |first=Josie |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/8783929/Irish-pensioner-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion.html |title=Irish pensioner 'died of spontaneous human combustion' |publisher=Telegraph |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
Mike Green, a retired professor of pathology, related one similar case in his career, but would not himself use the term spontaneous combustion. He believed there had to be some source of ignition, a cigarette or ember from a fire. The source of the ignition is subsequently lost as the body burns. Green surmised that the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Faherty were very similar to other possible cases. Green also dismissed any explanations centred on divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15032614 | title='First Irish case' of death by spontaneous combustion |publisher=BBC | date=23 September 2011 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Radford]], science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', contends, "Faherty's case may not be as mysterious as it looks. There was, after all, an open fire close to his burned body. It seems likely that a spark or ember might have popped from the fire onto his clothing, and caught his clothing on fire. It's not clear why the coroner conclusively ruled this explanation out." Radford also casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion, "If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn't it happen more often?"&lt;ref name="The Body Odd on MSNBC.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bodyodd.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/26/7976119-irishman-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion-coroner-claims| title=Irishman died of spontaneous human combustion, coroner claims|publisher=MSNBC| date=26 September 2011| accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dennis DeYoung''' (born February 18, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and producer best known for being a founding member of the rock band [[Styx (band)|Styx]] as primary lead vocalist and keyboardist, a tenure that lasted from 1970 until June 1999. DeYoung has been credited as the writer of more Styx songs than any other Styx member. He was also the band's most successful writer, penning 7 of the band's 8 Billboard Top 10 singles as well as a solo top 10 single.

==Early life==
Dennis DeYoung was born on February 18, 1947 in Chicago, Illinois to parents Maurice and Loraine DeYoung. Growing up in the [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] area of Chicago, DeYoung started his career as a vocalist in 1961 at the age of 14 when he teamed up with his 13-year-old neighbors [[Chuck Panozzo|Chuck]] and [[John Panozzo]] in a three-piece combo. The trio later added guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] and [[John Curulewski]] to form the band Tradewinds in the late 1960s. The band renamed itself TW4 in 1968 before becoming [[Styx (band)|Styx]] in 1970.

Before the band met with success, DeYoung spent time as an elementary school teacher in the southern suburbs of Chicago, where he taught music at a variety of schools. During this period, the band played a number of small venues and school auditoriums, refining their craft before the song "[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]" propelled them to national, then international, stardom.

On January 18, 1970, DeYoung married his longtime sweetheart Suzanne Feusi. The couple have two children, daughter Carrie Ann and son Matthew. Suzanne DeYoung frequently joined her husband on the road, and eventually their children came along as well, as a way to provide stability for their family.

DeYoung is an avid fan of the [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;[http://www.dennisdeyoung.com/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=letter1&amp;category=Letters Dennis DeYoung official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505075130/http://www.dennisdeyoung.com/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=letter1&amp;category=Letters |date=May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenure with Styx (1970–84)==
Within Styx, DeYoung acted as lead vocalist, keyboardist, accordion player, producer, and songwriter. From the start of Styx's commercial success with the 1972 DeYoung-penned single "Lady", DeYoung became the creative force behind most of the band's hit songs. DeYoung wrote and sang lead on six of the band's seven top 10 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-ranked hits during this period, with Tommy Shaw's "[[Too Much Time on My Hands]]" (#9) being the sole exception. The seven DeYoung penned-and-performed Top 10 Billboard hits, in order of their peak chart placement:

* "[[Babe (Styx song)|Babe]]", the band's only #1 hit to date
* "[[Mr. Roboto]]" (#3)
* "[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me The Way]]" (#3)
* "[[The Best of Times (song)|The Best of Times]]" (#3)
* "[[Don't Let It End]]" (#6)
* "[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]", the band's 1973 breakthrough hit (#6 in March 1975)
* "[[Come Sail Away]]" (#8)

A self-taught keyboardist, DeYoung quickly became one of the most notable keyboard players in rock. Featured on the cover of the January 1981 issue of ''Contemporary Keyboard'' magazine (a story that was reprinted in ''Contemporary Keyboard'''s book on the greatest rock keyboardists), DeYoung described many of his steps along the way through his keyboard-playing career: He'd never played an acoustic piano until the recording session for 1972's "Lady"; he recorded the track for 1979's "Babe" in a friend's basement on a Rhodes electric piano he'd never touched before; the odd feeling of switching back to playing accordion for the song "Boat on the River" and discovering how small the keys felt to his fingers after years of playing electric organs and pianos.&lt;ref name="ck"&gt;[http://www.styxnet.com/deyoung/print/int_ck81_1.html Text from article in ''Contemporary Keyboard'', January 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a keyboardist in Styx, DeYoung was best remembered for his prominent lead synthesizer solos performed on the [[Oberheim|Oberheim synthesizer]] that dominated the mix with a unique tone, a key element of the Styx sound. Influenced by the recent release of [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]]'s [[Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer (album)|first album]], DeYoung – a novice synthesizer player at the time – used a [[Moog modular synthesizer|modular Moog]] to record the keyboard tracks for Styx's [[Styx (album)|debut album]] in 1972. This album featured a rock version of "[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]", more than 5 years before ELP came up with a similar idea of recording this classical composition as a rock band featuring the synthesizer that would later become one of ELP's best known recordings.

DeYoung's songs often had a grandiose style to them in the tradition of 1970s theatrical rock, which heavily influenced the group's direction in the late 1970s, culminating in the [[concept album]]s ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]'' (1981) and ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (1983). The dissent of some members in the band during ''Kilroy'' brought tensions between the group's members over the future direction of the band, leading to guitarist [[Tommy Shaw]]'s departure in 1984.

==Early solo career (1984–89)==
With Styx in limbo following Shaw's 1984 departure, DeYoung began a solo career of modest success. His first solo album, ''[[Desert Moon]]'' (1984), generated a top 10 hit, "[[Desert Moon (song)|Desert Moon]]", and the follow-up single, "Don't Wait for Heroes", cracked the ''Billboard'' Top 100 as well. The ''Desert Moon'' album was certified gold in Canada in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/?fwp_gp_search=desert%20moon | title = Gold Platinum Database - Desert Moon | accessdate = 2015-04-15 | publisher = [[Music Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeYoung's solo career continued with [[Back to the World (Dennis DeYoung album)|''Back to the World'']] (1986), which contained the singles "Call Me" and "This Is the Time" which was featured in the soundtrack of ''[[Karate Kid II]]'' (1986) movie.  His third solo album [[Boomchild (album)|''Boomchild'']] (1988) failed to have a hit single, though the video for "Boomchild" received a fair amount of music video airplay.{{where?|date=October 2015}}

After a five-year hiatus; DeYoung and several other members of Styx began discussing a possible reunion in 1989. By December 1989 Styx had unofficially reformed. Tommy Shaw, who joined [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]] in 1988, did not return.

==Reuniting with Styx (1990–92)==
In 1990, Styx (minus Tommy Shaw, who was replaced by guitarist/singer-songwriter [[Glen Burtnik]]) returned to the studio for the album ''[[Edge of the Century]]'' (1990). "[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me the Way]]", a track written by DeYoung for his son Matthew, received extensive radio play, peaking at #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart (Styx's 8th top 10 single, and 7th written and sung by DeYoung) particularly after a number of radio stations mixed it with voice tracks of parents headed off to fight in the first [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].  This put the group in an exclusive group as one of only a few bands to have a top ten hit single under four different United States Presidents.  The group toured extensively before [[A&amp;M Records]] (which had just merged with PolyGram Records) dropped the group from its roster in 1992; the group broke up again shortly afterwards.

==Venture into acting (1993–95)==
Between stints with Styx, DeYoung, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], joined a touring revival of the stage musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' in 1993. He appeared in about 200 performances as [[Pontius Pilate]]. The experience inspired him to record his 1994 album of Broadway standards, ''[[10 on Broadway]]'', and to begin work on a musical of his own based on ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' ([[19th-century French literature|French]] [[Gothic novel]] by [[Victor Hugo]], [[published]] in 1831).

==Reuniting with Styx (1995–99)==

==="Lady '95" (1995)===
In 1987, A&amp;M Records had released the [[compilation album]] ''[[Styx Classics Volume 15|Styx - Classics, Volume 15]]'', but since A&amp;M did not own the rights to the original recording of "Lady" (which had been released by [[Wooden Nickel Records]] through a distribution deal with [[RCA Records]]), the track could not be included on the disc. In 1995, Styx reunited, this time with Shaw, but without a terminally ill John Panozzo, who had developed [[cirrhosis]] following years of chronic alcoholism. The band recorded a new version of "Lady", which became the lead track ("Lady '95") of a new compilation album, ''[[Styx Greatest Hits]]'', for A&amp;M. [[Todd Sucherman]] (uncredited) provided the drum track for the recording session. Panozzo died of gastrointestinal bleeding on July 16, 1996. Sucherman took his place, and in 1996, Styx toured for the first time in four years.

==="Return to Paradise" tour (1996–97)===
Styx's 1996 tour, dubbed the "Return to Paradise" tour by the band, proved remarkably successful, and a 2-disc live recording of the show (with three new studio tracks) proved even more so; 1997's ''[[Return to Paradise (Styx album)|Return to Paradise]]'' live album went gold and spawned a top-30 hit on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, the DeYoung-penned "[[Paradise (Styx song)|Paradise]]". With the positive response and a new record label ([[CMC International]]), Styx returned to the studio in 1998 and began work on their first studio album in eight years.

==Departure from Styx (1999)==
Though DeYoung and his bandmates had been able to put aside their musical and personal differences during the "Return to Paradise" tour, those same issues resurfaced once work started on their new album, ''[[Brave New World (Styx album)|Brave New World]]''. Complicating matters, DeYoung's physical health took a sudden turn for the worse; DeYoung said he was afflicted with a [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]-like disorder that affected his [[trigeminal nerve]], and that he would not be able to perform onstage due to a sensitivity to bright light and sound caused by this disorder. The other four members of Styx said that the band was contractually obliged to tour in support of the ''Brave New World'' album. When DeYoung reiterated his health issues made him unable to perform live, the other members of the band opted to replace DeYoung with Canadian star [[Lawrence Gowan]] in 1999 in order to fulfill their touring obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Lisa|title=Styx Survives Split|newspaper=Wall of Sound|date=June 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeYoung sued his former bandmates, seeking the rights to use the group's name in support of his solo career. The suit was settled in 2001, with the group being allowed to keep the name "Styx" and DeYoung able to use the name in descriptive phrases such as "the music of Styx" or "formerly of Styx" (but not "the voice of Styx").

Styx has consistently maintained that any chance of a reunion with DeYoung is unlikely. When asked about any possible reunions with DeYoung, James Young of Styx commented on an edition of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' television series, "Maybe when they are playing hockey on the river Styx." Young also addressed the reunion issue on an episode of VH1's ''Feuds 2000'', noting the possibility of a reunion would only happen "[A]s The Eagles said, 'when Hell freezes over'." Bassist [[Chuck Panozzo]], no longer actively touring with Styx due to health issues associated with his HIV-positive status, offered a more hopeful tone to a writer doing a story on the band for tampabay.com; while reflecting on the effect the loss of his fraternal twin brother, John, had on the band, Panozzo noted, "Before any more of us die, I would hope that it could happen. Every year that it doesn't happen is another year that goes by. And if you wait too long, who will care?" But in an interview Tommy Shaw gave ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2011 indicated that he didn't think a reunion was realistic, noting, "We're crazy, but we're not insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Andy|title=Styx: No Reunion With Former Frontman Dennis DeYoung|journal=Rolling Stone|date=July 7, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/styx-no-reunion-with-former-frontman-dennis-deyoung-20110707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Styx career==

In February 2000, DeYoung was approached to perform a concert featuring his many songs from Styx, as well as his solo works and his 1997 stage musical ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'', with an orchestra. The show, performed at the [[Rosemont Theatre]] near DeYoung's hometown of Chicago, was a family affair for DeYoung. His wife Suzanne and sister-in-law Dawn Marie Feusi sang backup, his daughter Carrie Ann was in charge of publicity, while his son Matthew designed the stage lighting. The concert was well received&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everson|first=John|title=Dennis DeYoung|url=http://www.popstops.net/deyoung.htm|work=The Illinois Entertainer|accessdate=April 6, 2014|date=February 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the basis for a touring version of the show, and eventually a 2004 live album, ''[[The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra]]''.

Healthy once again, DeYoung returned to touring with a 50-piece orchestra augmented by a five-piece rock band, which included Tommy Dziallo on guitar, Hank Horton on bass, and [[Kyle Woodring]] (from [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Deana Carter]]) on drums, all of whom also played shows with DeYoung with or without the orchestra.

DeYoung made his major motion picture debut in 2005's ''[[The Perfect Man]]'', in which he played the lead vocalist in a Styx [[tribute band]].

In August 2006, DeYoung appeared along with [[Supertramp]]'s [[Roger Hodgson]] on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where he performed with and mentored the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Sterling|title=The Grand Delusion: The Unauthorized True Story of Styx|year=2007|publisher=BookSurge Publishing|isbn=1419653539|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2006, at the Community Theatre in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], DeYoung took to the stage once again with former Styx guitarist and bassist [[Glen Burtnik]] as part of his ''Lost Treasures'' concert series. It marked the first time in nearly seven years that the two had appeared together. On his website, DeYoung jokingly dubbed the performances "The Denny and Glenny Show". While on stage, the duo opened with the Beatles classic "[[We Can Work It Out]]" and also performed "Watching the World Go by", and "All for Love", songs that were originally written for the unreleased ''Edge of the Century 2'' Styx album.

On September 14 and 15, 2006, DeYoung appeared with [[Hal Sparks]] on ''[[Celebrity Duets]]'', an American reality television show produced by [[Simon Cowell]]. They sang Styx songs "[[Come Sail Away]]" and "[[Mr. Roboto]]". DeYoung was invited back to perform on ''Celebrity Duets'' on September 28, 2006, with finalist [[Hal Sparks]]. The pair performed the Styx breakthrough hit "Lady", written by DeYoung in 1973, with DeYoung serenading his wife Suzanne in the audience while Hal did the same for his long-time girlfriend.

In 2007, DEP Records of Canada released DeYoung's stateside 2004 live CD ''[[The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra|Dennis DeYoung and the Music of Styx Live with Symphony Orchestra]]'', which went on to achieve platinum status.&lt;ref name="platinum-status"&gt;[http://www.cria.ca/gold/0306_g.php Platinum Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407065958/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0306_g.php |date=April 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In Canada 50,000 plus copies sold for a double CD qualifies as platinum.) They also released his DVD ''The Rock: Symphonic Music of Styx'', which went triple platinum.&lt;ref name="triple-platinum-status"&gt;[http://www.cria.ca/gold/0306_g.php Triple Platinum Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407065958/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0306_g.php |date=April 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he appeared on the Canadian reality TV series ''[[Star Académie]]''.

On June 19, 2007, DeYoung released in Canada his fifth solo album, ''[[One Hundred Years from Now (album)|One Hundred Years from Now]]'', marking a return to his rock roots. The first single, the title track, was a duet with [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] singer [[Éric Lapointe (singer)|Éric Lapointe]]. The single reached number 1 on the Québec Radio Single and Soundscan charts. The album was released in the U.S. on April 14, 2009, with slightly different tracks. One song "I Believe In You" received some airplay on Sirius XM and some local radio stations.

On New Year's Eve 2007, he performed "Mr. Roboto", "Come Sail Away" and many other Styx classics to a large audience at Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Canada, and millions of viewers via live television on CHCH-TV Channel 11. Following his concert, he did a brief live interview with CHCH-TV's Mat Hayes.

On May 8, 2008, DeYoung's musical version of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (2008 musical)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' premiered at the [[Bailiwick Repertory Theatre]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="bailiwick"&gt;[http://www.bailiwick.org/calendar/show_detail.php?ID=258 Bailiwick Repository Theatre Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; This production went on to win the [[Joseph Jefferson Awards|Joseph Jefferson Award]] for best musical in Chicago in 2008.&lt;ref name="joseph-jefferson"&gt;[http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/joseph_jefferson_awards/page/2/ Joseph Jefferson Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2008, DeYoung performed at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] benefit concert for the [[John Entwistle]] foundation. The benefit concert was held at the [[Koka Booth Amphitheatre]] in [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], North Carolina, and featured many other rock and roll musicians. He and his band performed many of Styx's hits.

In November and December 2008, DeYoung was a featured artist on the German [[Night of the Proms]] 20-city tour. He joined [[Robin Gibb]], [[Tears for Fears]], [[10CC]] and [[Kim Wilde]] on the sold-out tour. He also accompanied Robin Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]] on piano performing "[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]".

On July 12, 2009, DeYoung was honored by his native city Chicago with the "Great Performer of Illinois Award".&lt;ref name="great performers"&gt;[http://www.greatperformersofillinois.com Great Performers of Illinois Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the award ceremony in the [[Frank Gehry]]-designed [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]] in [[Millennium Park]] in Chicago, DeYoung and his band performed many of Styx's hits in a free concert.

On October 13, 2009, DeYoung's sound creation dubbed the "ARF 2600" (from [[ARP 2600]]) was given its world premiere at the opening of ''[[101 Dalmatians Musical|The 101 Dalmatians Musical]]'' in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twenty-Second Day of Mellowmas: DeYoungmas|url=http://popdose.com/the-twenty-second-day-of-mellowmas-deyoungmas/|work=Pop Dose|author=Jason Hare|author2=Jeff Giles|date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, DeYoung formed a new band to capture the sound and look of the original Styx band, dedicated to the music of Styx, adding a [[Tommy Shaw]] look-alike and sound-alike guitarist and lead vocalist August Zadra and bassist-vocalist Craig Carter to join John Blasucci, [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] look-alike guitarist Jimmy Leahey, [[Tom Sharpe (musician)|Tom Sharpe]], and wife Suzanne DeYoung in performing Styx hits "Renegade", "Blue Collar Man" and others as well as DeYoung's solo works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kibler|first=Kristy|title=DeYoung gives fans best of times.|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current band members have been lauded for their talents in their own right.

On October 21, 2014, a 2CD + DVD and Blu-ray package, ''Dennis DeYoung... And the Music of Styx Live in Los Angeles'', was released in the U.S. via [[Frontiers Records]]. The European release date was October 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontiers.it/album/5223/&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on October 21, 2014, a condensed version of this live concert package was broadcast on AXS TV Headliner Club Concert Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axs.tv/headliner-club/dennis-deyoung/&lt;/ref&gt; The concert took place at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California on March 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theelrey.com/events/detail/248271&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro II of Brazil]] was the second and last emperor of [[Brazil]]. Despite his popularity among Brazilians, Pedro II was removed from his throne in 1889 after a 58-year reign. He was promptly exiled with his family. Despite his deposition, he did not make an attempt to regain power. He died in 1891 while in Paris, France, after two years in exile.

The monarchist reaction after the [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Republican coup|fall of the empire]] "was not small, and even less so its repression."{{sfn|Salles|1996|p=194}} The "new regime suppressed with swift brutality and total disdain for civil liberties all attempts to launch a monarchist party or to publish monarchist newspapers."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=400}} Soon after several popular riots in protest against the coup occurred as well as battles between monarchist Army troops and republican militias.{{sfn|Mônaco Janotti|1986|p=117}} Those were followed by a civil war in which monarchist military and politicians tried to restore the empire in the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution (Brazil)|Federalist Revolution]] and the [[Revolta da Armada|Second Navy Rebellion]].{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=116}}{{sfn|Salles|1996|p=195}} The last monarchist rebellion occurred in 1904, in what was called the [[Vaccine Revolt]].{{sfn|Salles|1996|p=195}}{{sfn|Mônaco Janotti|1986|p=255}}

=== Death ===
On 23 November 1891, Pedro II appeared at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for the last time to participate in an election.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=238}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=26}} The following morning, he dispassionately noted in his diary the news that the dictator [[Deodoro da Fonseca]] had resigned: "10:30. Deodoro has quit."{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=28}} He soon afterwards took a long drive in an open carriage along the [[Seine]], even though it was a very cold day. He felt ill after returning to the Hôtel de Bedford that evening.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=238}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=27}} The illness progressed into [[pneumonia]] during the following days.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=238}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=29}} There was no celebration of his birthday on 2 December, with the exception of a simple mass said while he remained in bed. At that time [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|his daughter Isabel]], [[Gaston, comte d'Eu|his son-in-law Gaston]] and his grandchildren were in attendance.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=29}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|pp=238–9}}{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=489}} However, he later received several French and Brazilian visitors who had come to offer birthday congratulations.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=29}}

[[File:Pedro II 1891 00.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Pedro II, dressed with the uniform of [[Marshal (Brazil)#Marshals of the Empire of Brazil|Marshal of the Army]] lying in state, 6 December 1891. Notice the book under his head.]]

His health suddenly worsened on the morning of 3 December.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=30}} Other relatives and friends went to see him once news of the seriousness of the situation began to spread. On 4 December, he received the last sacrament from Abbé [[Pierre-Jacques-Almeyre Le Rébours]], [[Curate|curé]] of [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]].{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1891}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=601}} That night Pedro II began declining, and died at 12:35&amp;nbsp;am on 5 December.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|pp=238–9}}{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=489}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1892}} His last words were, "May God grant me these last wishes&amp;nbsp;– peace and prosperity for Brazil..."{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=30}} He was so weakened that he suffered no pain.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=601}} Pedro II was surrounded by his daughter Isabel, the Count of Eu, his grandchildren ([[Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão Para|Pedro]], [[Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (1878–1920)|Luís]], [[Prince Antônio Gastão of Orléans-Braganza|Antonio]], [[Prince Peter of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Pedro Augusto]] and [[Prince August Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Augusto Leopoldo]]), his sisters [[Januária Maria, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Januária]] and [[Princess Francisca of Brazil|Francisca]] with their husbands (respectively the [[Prince Louis, Count of Aquila|Count of Aquila]] and the [[François d'Orléans, prince de Joinville|Prince of Joinville]]).{{sfn|Lyra 1977, Vol 3|p=165}}

According to the [[death certificate]] the ''causa mortis'' was acute pneumonia in the left lung.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=489}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=602}} Pedro II died without abdicating, and Isabel inherited the claim to the throne of the Brazilian Empire.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=489}} She solemnly kissed her father's hands, and after that, all those present, including dozens of Brazilians already there kissed her hand, recognizing her as the Empress ''de jure'' of Brazil.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1892}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=602}} The [[Baron of Rio Branco]], who was also present, later wrote: "The Brazilians, thirty and something, went in line and, one by one, sprinkled holy water on the corpse and kissed his hand. I did the same. They were saying farewell to the great dead."{{sfn|Lyra 1977, Vol 3|p=165}} Senator [[Gaspar da Silveira Martins]] arrived soon after the Emperor's death and, when he saw the body of his old friend, wept convulsively.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=605}}

Isabel declined an autopsy, which allowed the body to be embalmed at 9&amp;nbsp;am on 5 December.

=== Funeral ===

In the hours following the death of Pedro II, thousands of people came to the Hôtel de Bedford. Among these were the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council of Ministers]], [[Charles de Freycinet]], and the ministers of War and the Navy.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=605}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1893}} In a single day, more than 2,000 telegrams were received by the hotel with messages of condolence.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=606}} French president [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was traveling in the south of the country and sent the members of the Military Household to pay homage to the deceased monarch on his behalf.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=607}} Princess Isabel wished to hold a discrete and private burial ceremony.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=609}} However, she eventually accepted the French Government's request for a [[State funeral|Head of State's funeral]]. To prevent political disruption,{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=613}} the government decided that the burial would be officially accorded because the Emperor was a recipient of the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]],{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1896}} although with the pomp due to a monarch.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=489}} Requests from Brazil's republican government to deny an official funeral and any public display of the imperial flag were ignored by the French government.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=613}}

The coffin which contained the body of Pedro II departed the Hôtel de Bedford for [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]] on the evening of 8 December.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=615}} Eight French soldiers bore the coffin, which was covered with the imperial flag.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=615}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1899}} A crowd of more than 5,000 people was on hand to witness the cortege.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=615}} The hearse was the same one used for the funerals of Cardinal [[François-Nicholas-Madeleine Morlot|Morlot]], the [[Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny|duc de Morny]] and [[Adolphe Thiers]].{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1899}}

[[File:Funeral Pedro II 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedro II's coffin leaving the [[Église de la Madeleine|Church of Madeleine]], 1891.]]

On the following day, thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at La Madeleine. Aside from Pedro II's family, these included: [[Amadeo of Spain|Amadeo of Savoy]], former king of Spain; [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]], former king of the Two Sicilies; [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], former queen of Spain; [[Philippe, comte de Paris]]; and other members of European royalty.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1898}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=617}} Also present were General [[Joseph Brugère]], representing President Sadi Carnot; the presidents of the [[Senate of France|Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]]{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}} as well as their members; diplomats; and other representatives of the French government.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=618}} Nearly all members of the [[Académie française|French Academy]], the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]], the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] and the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]] were in attendance.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1899}} Also among those present were [[Eça de Queiroz]],{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}} [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], [[Gabriel Auguste Daubrée]], [[Jules Arsène Arnaud Claretie]], [[Marcellin Berthelot]], [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]], [[Edmond Jurien de la Gravière]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[Camille Doucet]], and many other notable personages.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1899}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1898}} Other governments from the Americans and Europe also sent representatives, as did distant countries such as [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Persia under Qajar dynasty|Persia]].{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=618}} Notably absent was any delegation from Brazil.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}}

[[File:Paris. — Funeráilles de Dom Pedro II, Empereur de Brésil. — (Dessin d'après nature, de M.

Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the train station, from whence it would travel to [[Portugal]]. Between 200,000{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=239}} and 300,000{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} people lined the route despite incessant rain and cold temperatures.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=614}} Some 80,000 French military troops marched in the procession.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=620}} Two carriages carried almost 200 funeral [[wreaths]] which bore messages paying homage to the Emperor such as: "To Dom Pedro, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria R.I.]]",{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} "To the great Emperor for whom [[Luís Alves de Lima e Silva|Caxias]], [[Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval|Osório]], Andrade Neves and many other heroes fought, Fatherland Volunteers from [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]",{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=619}} "A group of Brazilian students in Paris",{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} "Happy times when the thought, the word and the pen were free, when Brazil freed oppressed people…" (sent by the Baron of Ladário, [[Marquis of Tamandaré]], Viscount of Sinimbu, Rodolfo Dantas, [[Joaquim Nabuco]] and [[Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay|Taunay]]),{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} "To the great Brazilian worthy of honors from the Fatherland and Humanity. ''Ubique Patria Memor''."{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} (sent by the [[Baron of Rio Branco]]),{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=604}} "From the people of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] to the liberal and patriotic king",{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} and "A [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian black]] on behalf of his race".{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1900}} The "state funeral granted by the French republic proclaimed the former’s [Pedro II] personal virtues and popularity and, by implication, distinguished the imperial regime from other monarchies."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=401}}

All along the route, from France, through Spain and finally into Portugal, people paid homage to Pedro II. But still no representative appeared on behalf of Brazil's republican government.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=240}} The journey continued on to the [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora|Church of São Vicente de Fora]] near [[Lisbon]], where the body of Pedro II was interred in the [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora#Braganza Pantheon|Braganza Pantheon]] on 12 December. His tomb rested between that of his stepmother [[Amélie of Leuchtenberg|Amélia]] and that of his wife [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]].{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=240}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|pp=1900–2}}

=== Death's repercussions ===

The Brazilian republican government, "fearful of a backlash resulting from the death of the emperor," banned any official reaction.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=493}} Nevertheless, the [[Brazilian people]] were far from indifferent to Pedro II's demise, and the "repercussions in Brazil were also immense, despite the government's effort to suppress. There were demonstrations of sorrow throughout the country: shuttered business activity, flags displayed at half-staff, black armbands on clothes, death knells, religious ceremonies."{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=240}}{{sfn|Mônaco Janotti|1986|p=50}} An article written by João Mendes de Almeida on 7 December 1891 says that, "The news of the death of His Majesty Emperor Dom Pedro II has revealed the feelings of the Brazilian nation towards the Imperial dynasty. The consternation has been general."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=495}} Solemn "masses were held all over the country, which were followed by eulogies praising Dom Pedro II and the monarchy".{{sfn|Mônaco Janotti|1986|p=50}} So, the "Republic stood by silently, given the strength and impact of reactions."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=493}}

[[File:Funeral pedro II Lisboa 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedro II's coffin arriving in Lisbon, 1891.]]

Police were sent to suppress public demonstrations of sorrow, "provoking serious incidents", although "the people were in sympathy with these manifestants."{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=610}} A popular gathering in memory of the deceased emperor occurred on 9 December and was organized by the Marquis of Tamandaré, Viscount of Ouro Preto, Viscount of Sinimbu, Baron of Ladário, Carlos de Laet, Alfredo d' Escragnolle Taunay, Rodolfo Dantas, Afonso Celso and Joaquim Nabuco.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1907}} Even old political adversaries of Pedro II praised him, "criticizing his policies" but pointing out "his patriotism, honesty, abnegation, spirit of justice, devotion to work, tolerance and simplicity."{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=241}} [[Quintino Bocaiúva]], one of the main republican leaders, spoke: "The entire world, it may be said, has paid homage which Mr. Dom Pedro de Alcântara has earned through his virtues as a great citizen."{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=240}} Some "members of republican clubs protested against what they characterized as exaggerated sentimentalism in the tributes, seeing in these monarchist maneuvers. They were lonely voices."{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=240}}

Foreign reaction also revealed sympathy towards the monarch. ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 5 December praised Pedro II, considering him "the most enlightened monarch of the century" and also stating that "he made Brazil as free as a monarchy could be."{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|pp=240–1}} The ''[[New York Herald|Herald]]'' wrote: "In another time, and in happier circumstances, he would be worshiped and honored by his subjects and would be known in history as 'Dom Pedro the Good'."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=491}} ''[[New York Tribune|The Tribune]]'' affirmed that his "reign was serene, peaceable and prosperous."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=491}} ''[[The Times]]'' observed, in a long article, "Until November 1889, it was believed that the deceased Emperor and his wife were unanimously beloved in Brazil due to his intellectual and moral qualities and by his affectionate interest for the well-being of his subjects [...] When in Rio de Janeiro he was constantly seen in public; and two times per week he met his subjects, as well as foreign travelers, captivating all with his courtesy."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=491}}

''The Weekly Register'' wrote, "He looked more like a poet or a scholar than an emperor, but had he had been given the chance to materialize his several projects, without a doubt he would have made Brazil one of the richest countries in the [[New World]]."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|pp=491–2}} The French periodical ''Le Jour'' affirmed that "he was effectively the first sovereign that, following [[Franco-Prussian War|our disaster of 1871]], dared to visit us. Our defeat did not move him away from us. France will know how to be grateful."{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=609}} ''The Globe'' also wrote that he "was well learned, he was patriotic; he was gentle and indulgent; he had all the private virtues, as well as the public ones, and died in exile."{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=492}}

'''Firmin Pierre Breaux''' was an Acadian pioneer known for unofficially founding the city of [[Breaux Bridge]], [[Louisiana]].

==Life==
Firmin was the son of Alexis Breaux and Marguerite Brillot, born at [[Rivière-aux-Canards|Riviere aux Canards]], near present day [[Port Williams, Nova Scotia]] in 1749. In 1755, Firmin's family, along with many other Acadians, were deported from [[Canada]] into [[Boston]] during the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. In 1767, at the age of 17, Firmin found himself at the Bayou Tortue in Louisiana, while the rest of his family returned to Canada.&lt;ref name = "NarrativeHistoryOfBreauxBridge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Grover|title=A Narrative History of Breaux Bridge, Once Called "La Pointe"|year=1976|pages=17–19, 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "BreauxBuiltABridge"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeVilliers|first=Gladys|title=Breaux Built a Bridge|url=http://www.gladysdevilliers.acadian-home.org/Breaux-Louisiana.html|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1769, Firmin had moved into a house in present day St. James Parish, and had been married to his wife Marguerite Braud.

==Breaux Bridge==
In 1771, Firmin bought land near the [[Bayou Teche]] from the wealthy New Orleans merchant, Jean François Ledée, who had acquired the land as a French land grant. By 1774, Breaux's branding iron had been registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners near the Bayou Teche.

In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche, in order to ease the passage of his family and neighbors across the Teche.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">'''Francita Alavez''' (c. 1816 &amp;ndash; c. 1906) was known as the "Angel of Goliad," for saving the lives of Texas prisoners of war in the "Goliad Massacre" and at Copano and Victoria, Texas, by interceding on their behalf and persuading the help of Mexican officials.

==Early life==
Francita's definite date and town of birth are not known. Even her real name has been referred to differently at times, such as '''Panchita''', '''Francisca''', '''Pancheta''', or '''Francita''', and her surname as '''Alevesco''', '''Alvárez''', or '''Alavez'''.

==Texas revolution==
During the [[Texas Revolution]], she did travel to Texas in 1836, as a companion of Captain Telesforo Alavez, who had sailed to Texas from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], Mexico to El Cópano port at Copano Bay, Texas.

==An Angel of mercy==
{{further|Goliad Campaign}}
At [[Copano, Texas|El Cópano]], she combined her compassion for humanity with her strong willed personality to influence important Mexican officials  to treat the Texian prisoners humanely. When 80 soldiers of Major William Parsons Miller and the Nashville Battalion were captured by Urrea's soldiers, she influenced the Mexican soldiers to untie the men's hands and to give them something to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=George O. |last=Coalson |title=Alavez, Francita |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal53 |accessdate=June 19, 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In La Bahia [[Goliad, Texas|(Goliad)]], due to the intervention of this [[Angel of Goliad]] and the courageous effort of Colonel Francisco Garay, 20 more men were held and spared as doctors, interpreters, or workers.&lt;ref name=hardin237&gt;Hardin (1994), pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Francita entered the presidio the night before the massacre, bringing several men out with her and hiding them until after the [[Goliad Massacre]]. She also made sure the 80 men from Miller's Natchez group were not executed.

In [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]], where her husband was left in charge, she saw to it that the 26 [[Texian]] boat builders and workers there would be released and not executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig H. |last=Roell |title=Georgia Battalion |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qjg01 |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the defeat of Santa Anna, Francita returned with Captain Alavez to [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. At the prison in Matamoros, she continued to support the Texians imprisoned there. When Captain Alavez left for Mexico City, Francita went with him. But their relationship soon ended. She then left Mexico City and returned to Matamoros. While broke and down on her luck, she was befriended by Texians who knew of her humanitarian acts. The 1936 memoirs of Elena O'Shea, a King Ranch schoolteacher, claim that Francita Alavez traveled back to Texas with her new friends, where she was employed to work on the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TAMU |title=Goliad Angel |url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm |work=Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas |first=Wallace L. |last=McKeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppe Di Vittorio''', also known under the [[pseudonym]] ''Nicoletti'' (August 11, 1892 – November 3, 1957), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[syndicalist]] and [[communist]] politician. He was one of the most influential [[trade union]] leaders of the [[labour movement]] after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Di Vittorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of  Di Vittorio|url=http://www.casadivittorio.it/biografia.html|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born at [[Cerignola]], [[Apulia]], into a family of poor agricultural day laborers. As an [[autodidacticism|autodidact]], Di Vittorio became active in the [[socialist]] movement in adolescence. At 15, he was a member of the Socialist Youth Circle in Cerignola, and in 1911, he moved to lead the [[Camera del Lavoro]] in [[Minervino Murge]] and then the one in [[Bari]].

He was among the most influential union leaders in the history of the labour movement, leading the Confederazione Generate Italiana dei Lavoratori (CGIL) in its refounding after fascism and the powerful World Federation of Trade Unions(FSM) after World War II.

After his father's death, Di Vittorio was forced to leave school and work as a day laborer. He joined the May 1904 general strike during which five workers were killed by troops in Cerignola. Di Vittorio was strongly influenced by the growth of peasants' organizations and the spread of socialist ideas, giving rise to his participation in the local young socialist organization in Cerignola. He was radicalised by affiliating with the national Federazione Giovanile Socialista (Federation of Young Socialists), led by syndicalists in opposition to the official Socialist Party Youth Federation.

As a native of the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'', Di Vittorio became involved in the syndicalist plans for solving the region's acute problems in the manner illustrated by the [[Fasci Siciliani]] in final decade of the 19th century. A partisan of [[insurgence]], Di Vittorio became a leader of an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union, [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]], after its formation in 1912. Unlike the majority of the group, which opposed [[militarism]] and Italy's entry into [[World War I]]), Di Vittorio, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Filippo Corridoni]] advocated [[irredentism]]. He then fought in the conflict and was discharged after he had been gravely wounded.

==Antifascism==
In 1921, after the [[Italian Socialist Party]]'s split at the Congress of [[Livorno]], he joined the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCd'I). Di Vittorio joined the militant antifascist organization ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', and hevwas then elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] on the PCI list in 1924. The new situation after the rise of [[fascism]] and the [[March on Rome]] made him an enemy of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime. Sentenced to twelve years in prison by a fascist special tribunal in 1925, he managed to flee to [[France]], where he refounded the dissolved [[Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro]] (CGIL) and led it into the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-managed [[Profintern]]. Di Vittorio lived in the Soviet state from 1928 to 1930, representing Italy to the [[Red Peasant International]]. He then returned to [[Paris]], where he entered the [[Politburo]] of the PCI.

He joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side fighting [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936. He was Political Commissar of the [[XI International Brigade]]. After the fall of the Republic, he headed the board of a Paris-based antifascist newspaper. During the [[World War II]], after the [[Fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]], Di Vittorio was arrested by Nazis, taken in custody by the Italian police and detained on [[Ventotene]]. In 1943, as the Fascist regime fell in most of Italy, he was set free by [[partisan (military)|partisans]], and he joined the [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]] in fighting against Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]], in Northern Italy.

==Postwar==
When war ended in 1945, he was elected secretary of the CGIL, which he had helped return to politics through a pact signed the previous year with [[Achille Grandi]] and [[Oreste Lizzardi]] in [[Rome]]. The pact recreated CGIL as a representative of all currents of trade unionism in Italy [[Partito Comunista Italiano|communist]], [[Partito Socialista Italiano|socialist]], [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian-democrats]] and anarcho-syndicalists. In 1948, the organisation split after a [[general strike]], protesting the [[assassination]] attempt on PCI leader [[Palmiro Togliatti]]. The Christian Democrats left to form the [[Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori]]. On March 5, 1950, the Social Democrats, who would join the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]], left to form the [[Unione Italiana del Lavoro]].

Di Vittorio led the CGIL, as a group favoured by the PCI and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], until his death at [[Lecco]], in 1957. He was also a longtime leader of the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. His strong charisma made him the most popular myth of the Italian workers. His funeral was attended by more than three million people coming to Rome from all over Italy. 

He was followed in his position at the CGIL by [[Agostino Novella]].

The '''International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children''' ('''ICMEC'''), headquartered in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with a regional presence in Brazil and Singapore, is a private [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-governmental]], [[nonprofit]] global organization. It combats [[child sexual exploitation]], [[child pornography]], and [[child abduction]].

Formed in 1998, ICMEC heads a global missing children's network of 22 countries. The organization has trained law enforcement personnel from 121 countries, works with law enforcement in over 100 countries, and has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography. ICMEC also encourages the creation of national operational centers built on a [[public-private partnership]] model, and leads global financial and industry coalitions to eradicate child sexual exploitation and child pornography.

The Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy is the International Centre's research arm. In August 2008, ICMEC was granted "Special Consultative Status" by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), to assist the UN with its expertise regarding child sexual exploitation and child abduction. ICMEC also works with the [[intergovernmental organization]] [[INTERPOL]], the inter-continental organization the [[Organization of American States]] (the OAS), and the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]].

==Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy==
In 2007, American artist [[Jeff Koons]], along with his wife Justine, founded the Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy.&lt;ref name=KoonsI/&gt; It is the International Centre's research arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Josh-Groban-Among-Honorees-for-National-YoungArts-Foundation-Backyard-Ball-20141203|title=Josh Groban Among Honorees for National Young Arts Foundation Backyard Ball|author=Music News Desk|work=Broadway World|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;Ingrid Sischy (July 2014) [http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/07/jeff-koons-whitney-retropective "Jeff Koons Is Back!"], ''Vanity Fair''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/836804/news/story/750588/jeff-koons-gets-under-your-skin-with-a-new-kiehls-moisturizer-line-for-charity|title=Jeff Koons Gets Under Your Skin With a New Kiehl's Moisturizer Line for Charity|work=Art+Auction |author=Ann Binlot |date=November 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KoonsI/&gt;

As highlighted by articles over the years, including a ''Wall Street Journal'' article entitled "Pooling Resources to Fight Child Abuse and Abduction", the issue of child abduction is personal to Koons.&lt;ref name=skin/&gt;&lt;ref name=collab/&gt; Following the end of his marriage to Hungarian-born Italian porn actress [[Ilona Staller]] in 1994, as she wanted to continue to perform as a porn actress and Koons wanted them to be monogamous, Staller, in violation of a US court order, left with their then-two-year-old son, Ludwig and took the child to Italy.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=skin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trentonian.com/arts-and-entertainment/20140711/jeff-koons-retrospective-at-the-whitney-museum-of-art-nyc|title=Jeff Koons: Retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art NYC|author= Tammy Duffy|work= The Trentonian|date=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Koons spent millions of dollars in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing [[parental rights]] to his young son, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] failed to recognize the couples' US-based [[joint custody]] agreement and instead sided with Staller.&lt;ref name=skin/&gt;&lt;ref name=collab/&gt;&lt;ref name=pool/&gt;

This loss for Koons led him to establish the Koons Family Institute, and devote over $4.3 million to the International Centre's work.&lt;ref name=collab/&gt;&lt;ref name=pool&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304707604577424451609727644|title=Pooling Resources to Fight Child Abuse and Abduction|author=Melanie Grayce West|date=May 25, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Koons' 2010 partnership with [[Kiehl's]] to design the artwork for a limited edition moisturizer line raised $200,000 for the Koons Family Institute.&lt;ref name=KoonsI/&gt;&lt;ref name=collab&gt;Helen Werbe (December 2, 2010).

In 2006, the International Centre published a report of findings on the presence of child pornography legislation in the then-184 [[INTERPOL]] member countries.  It later updated this information, in subsequent editions, to include 196 UN member countries.&lt;ref name="icmec.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=4346|title=Child Pornography: Model Legislation &amp; Global Review|publisher=ICMEC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415101647/http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=4346|archivedate=April 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VPhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Litigating Transnational Human Rights Obligations: Alternative Judgments|publisher=Routledge |author1=Mark Gibney |author2=Wouter Vandenhole |page=63 |year=2013|ISBN=1135121052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_AF0rzXS9AC&amp;pg=PA20|title=Parents Guide to the Internet|author=Jay LaBonte|publisher=Lulu|pages=20–21|year= 2007|ISBN=1430307692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kI51wV4ticIC&amp;pg=PA136|title=Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence|author=John J.

ICMEC stated that it found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 95 countries did not have any legislation that specifically addressed child pornography, making child pornography a global issue worsened by the inadequacies of domestic legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/cybersecurity/cop/icmec-model-legislation-update-april-2010.pdf "Model Legislation Update: Since the Beginning"], ICMEC.

In June 2009, the Koons Family Institute partnered with The Protection Project at [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]], creating the Child Protection Project, to draft a model law focusing on the issues of child protection; in particular:  "neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation".&lt;ref name="protectionproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectionproject.org/activities/international-human-rights-clinic/expert-group-meetings-on-drafting-human-rights-legislation/|title=Drafting Human Rights Legislation Expert Group|publisher=The Protection Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objectives of the Child Protection Project are to: "research existing child protection laws in the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN); convene a series of regional expert working group meetings to establish a common definition for 'child protection;' create a database of national legislation and case law on child protection issues from around the world; and draft, publish, and globally disseminate model child protection legislation."&lt;ref&gt;Katai de Mello Dantas (August 1, 2011) [http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/profiles/blogs/protecting-children-from?xg_source=activity "Protecting Children from Exploitation: Discussions on Creating a Model Law and a Parliamentary Guide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205001330/http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/profiles/blogs/protecting-children-from?xg_source=activity |date=December 5, 2014 }}, Peace &amp; Collaborative Development Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting process included six expert group meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the US.&lt;ref name="protectionproject.org"/&gt; The final version of the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013.

The parents of [[Madeleine McCann]], a four-year-old girl who disappeared from her bed in a hotel in Portugal in 2007, approached ICMEC to help them publicize her case. ICMEC's YouTube channel, "Don'tYouForgetAboutMe," which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and {{as of|2014|November|lc=y}} had 2,200 members.&lt;ref name=peo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20051149,00.html|title=Madeleine McCann's Parents Create Missing Kids Site on Youtube|work=People|author=Ellen Tumposky|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DontYouForgetAboutMe|title=DontYouForgetAboutMe|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/10/ukcrime.madeleinemccann "'You have to blank out the dark thoughts'"], ''The Guardian'', August 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate.&lt;ref name=peo/&gt;

In 2003, ICMEC signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], the goal of which is to raise money for projects that interest both organizations.&lt;ref name=plan/&gt;

In August 2008, ICMEC was granted "[[Consultative Status|Special Consultative Status]]" by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), to assist the UN with its  expertise regarding [[child sexual exploitation]] and child abduction.&lt;ref name=status&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=3772|title=International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children Granted Special Status with United Nations|publisher=ICMEC|date=August 12, 2008|access-date=September 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930051127/http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=3772|archive-date=September 30, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICMEC also works with the [[intergovernmental organization]] INTERPOL, the inter-continental organization the [[Organization of American States]] (the OAS), the Hague Conference on Private International Law, and law enforcement and elected officials in a number of countries.&lt;ref name=critical/&gt;&lt;ref name=spot/&gt;

==Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography==
In 2006, ICMEC, NCMEC, and a number of banks, credit card companies, and electronic and third party [[payment network]]s created the [[Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography]] (FCACP).&lt;ref name=cyber/&gt;&lt;ref name=perspectives&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjXn3zA7HFcC&amp;pg=PA514|title=International Perspectives on the Assessment and Treatment of Sexual Offenders: Theory, Practice and Research|author1=Reinhard Eher |author2=Leam A.

In 2007, the FCACP developed and published a best practices guide for financial institutions, entitled "Internet Merchant Acquisition and Monitoring Best Practices for Prevention and Detection of Commercial Child Pornography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmec.org/en_X1/pdf/InternetMerchantAcquisition.pdf "Internet Merchant Acquisition and Monitoring Best Practices for Prevention and Detection of Commercial Child Pornography"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410112947/http://www.icmec.org/en_X1/pdf/InternetMerchantAcquisition.pdf |date=April 10, 2012 }}, ICMEC.

This U.S.-based effort expanded regionally with the creation of the Asia Pacific Financial Coalition in August 2009.

The dramatic circumstances of her relationship with Peter (at the time Prince of Portugal), which was forbidden by his father King Afonso IV, her murder at the orders of Afonso, Peter's bloody revenge on her killers, and the legend of the coronation of her exhumed corpse by Peter, have made Inês de Castro a frequent subject of art, music, and drama through the ages.

==Biography==
Inês was the natural daughter of [[Pedro Fernández de Castro]], Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and his noble Portuguese mistress Aldonça Lourenço de Valadares.&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario histórico, genealógico y heráldico de las familias ilustres de la Monarquia Espanola'',  Ed. Luis Vilar y Pascual, Juan José Vilar Psayla, (Imprenta de D.F. Sanchez A Cargo de Augustin Espinosa, 1859), 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family descended both from the Galician and Portuguese nobilities. She was also well connected to the Castilian royal family, by illegitimate descent.  Her stepmother was Infanta Beatrix of Portugal, the youngest daughter of [[Afonso of Portugal, Lord of Portalegre]] and [[Violante Manuel]].  Her grandmother was Violante Sánchez de Castile, Lady of Uzero, the illegitimate daughter of [[Sancho IV of Castile]].  Her great-great grandfather was Rodrigo Alfonso de León, Lord of Aliger, the illegitimate son of [[Alfonso IX of León]]. She was also legitimately descended from Infanta Sancha Henriques of Portugal, the daughter of [[Henry, Count of Portugal]].

Inês came to Portugal in 1340 as a maid of [[Constance of Peñafiel|Constance of Castile]], recently married to [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter]], the heir apparent to the Portuguese throne.&lt;ref name="Henry Morse Stephens"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Henry Morse|title=Portugal|year=1898|publisher=G.P. Putnam's sons|location=New York|pages=92–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prince fell in love with her and started to neglect his lawful wife, endangering the already feeble relations with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Moreover, Peter's love for Inês brought the exiled Castilian nobility very close to power, with Inês's brothers becoming the prince's friends and trusted advisors. King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]], Peter's father, disliked Inês's influence on his son and waited for their mutual infatuation to wear off, but it did not.

Constance of Castile died in 1345. Afonso IV tried several times to arrange for his son to be remarried, but Pedro refused to take a wife other than Inês, who was not deemed eligible to be queen. Peter's legitimate son, future King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal]], was a frail child, whereas Peter and Inês's illegitimate children were thriving; this created even more discomfort among the Portuguese nobles, who feared the increasing Castilian influence over Peter. Afonso IV banished Inês from the court after Constance's death, but Peter remained with her declaring her as his true love. After several attempts to keep the lovers apart, Afonso IV ordered Inês's death. Pêro Coelho, Álvaro Gonçalves, and Diogo Lopes Pacheco went to the [[Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha]] in [[Coimbra]], where Inês was detained, and killed her, decapitating her in front of her small child. When Peter heard of this he sought out the killers and managed to capture two of them in 1361.&lt;ref&gt;[Coelho and Gonçalves. Pacheco died in 1383]&lt;/ref&gt; He executed them publicly, ripping their hearts out claiming they didn't have one after having pulverized his own heart.

Peter became king of Portugal in 1357 ([[Peter I of Portugal]]). He then stated that he had secretly married Inês, who was consequently the lawful queen, although his word was, and still is, the only proof of the marriage.  During the [[1383–85 Crisis]] of royal succession in Portugal, [[João das Regras]] produced evidence that allegedly established that [[Pope Innocent IV]] had refused Peter's request to recognize his marriage to Inês and legitimize his children by her, the elder of whom, [[John, Duke of Valencia de Campos]] would have a strong potential claim to the throne of Portugal.  By negating these children's claimed legitimacy, João das Regras strengthened the claim of another illegitimate child of Peter I of Portugal: John, Master of Aviz, who ultimately took the throne and ruled as [[John I of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livermore|first1=H.

Some sources say that after Peter became king of Portugal, he had Inês' body exhumed from her grave and forced the entire court to swear allegiance to their new queen: "The king [Peter] caused the body of his beloved Inês to be disinterred, and placed on a throne, adorned with the diadem and royal robes. and required all the nobility of the kingdom to approach and kiss the hem of her garment, rendering her when dead that homage which she had not received in her life..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Popular Encyclopedia|date=1836|publisher=Blackie &amp; Son|location=Edinburgh|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfhTfVbnefUC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=In%C3%AAs+de+Castro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PAc4Vb7GGujnsAT5t4HoCw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=In%C3%AAs%20de%20Castro&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some modern sources characterize the story of the Ines' post-mortem coronation is a "legend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas L.

Both marble coffins are exquisitely sculpted with scenes from their lives and a promise by Peter that they would be together ''até ao fim do mundo'' (until the end of the world).

Inês de Castro and Peter I had the following children, who were legitimized by Peter I on 19 March 1361:
*Afonso, died shortly after birth.
*[[Beatrice, Countess of Alburquerque|Beatrice]], married [[Sancho Alfonso, 1st Count of Alburquerque]] and was thereby the great-grandmother of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], son of [[John II of Aragon]], son of [[Eleanor of Alburquerque]], daughter of [[Beatrice, Countess of Alburquerque]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John, Duke of Valencia de Campos]], claimant to the throne during the [[1383–85 Crisis]].
*[[Denis, Lord of Cifuentes]], claimant to the throne during the 1383–1385 Crisis.

[[Image:Ines de castro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Murder of Inês de Castro''. Painting by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, ca. 1901/04.]]
Inês de Castro's story is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as ''[[Os Lusíadas|The Lusíadas]]'' by [[Luís de Camões]] (canto iii, stanzas 118-135), and Spanish, such as ''Nise lastimosa'' and ''Nise laureada'' (1577) by [[Jerónimo Bermúdez]], ''Reinar despues de morir'' by [[Luís Vélez de Guevara]], as well as by the [[Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis|comtesse de Genlis]] (Inès de Castro, 1826), and in a play by French playwright [[Henry de Montherlant]] called ''La Reine morte'' (''The Dead Queen''). [[Mary Russell Mitford]] also wrote a drama from the story entitled ''Inez de Castro''. ''Inês de Castro'' is a novel by [[Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro]] ([[:es:María Pilar Queralt del Hierro|es]]) in Spanish and Portuguese.

She is a recurring figure in Ezra Pound's ''[[The Cantos]]''. She appears first at the end of Canto III, in the lines ''Ignez da Castro murdered, and a wall/Here stripped, here made to stand''.

There have been over 20 operas and ballets created about Inês de Castro.&lt;ref name="Carvalhaes1908"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Pereira Peixoto d'Almeida Carvalhaes|title=Inês de Castro na opera e na choregraphia italianas: separata da obra em manuscripto intitulada: Subsidios a historia da opera e da choregraphia italianas, no seculo XVIII, em Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkAQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=1908|publisher=Typ.

In addition, Portuguese composer [[Pedro Camacho]] (born 1979) composed the Requiem to Inês de Castro, first performed on March 28, 2012 in [[New Cathedral of Coimbra]] on the occasion of 650 years of the transportation of Ines de Castro's body from [[Coimbra]] to [[Alcobaça Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;

Christopher Bochman,with the Lisbon Youth Orchestra, has produced an opera "Corpo E Alma" (Body and Soul) focusing on Pedro's transition from a sensual to a spiritual love following her death, drawing on various aspects of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;(a live recording was made with the assistance of the Portuguese Ministry of Culture and others).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Itzhak Perlman''' ({{lang-he|יצחק פרלמן}}; born 31 August 1945) is an [[Israeli-American]] violinist, conductor, and music teacher. Over the course of his career, Perlman has performed worldwide, and throughout the United States, in venues that have included a State Dinner at the [[White House]] honoring [[Queen Elizabeth II]], and at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Presidential Inauguration]] of [[President Obama]], and he has conducted the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], and the [[Westchester Philharmonic]]. In 2015, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Early life==
Perlman was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1945, then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], now [[Israel]]. &lt;!-- please do not add "Israel"; it did not exist in 1945--&gt; His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were natives of [[Poland]] and had independently [[Aliyah|immigrated to Palestine]] in the mid-1930s before they met and later married.

Perlman first became interested in the violin after hearing a classical music performance on the radio. At the age of three, he was denied admission to the [[Shulamit Conservatory]] for being too small to hold a violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/pqdweb?index=2&amp;did=445171182&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1317432895&amp;clientId=43922 |title=Israeli Violin Prodigy Admits He Likes Jazz |publisher=Proquest.com |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead taught himself how to play the instrument using a toy fiddle until he was old enough to study with Rivka Goldgart at the Shulamit Conservatory and at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv, where he gave his first recital at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/21349?q=itzhak+perlman&amp;hbutton_search.x=0&amp;hbutton_search.y=0&amp;hbutton_search=search&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1 |title=Perlman, Itzhak |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the United States to study at the [[Juilliard School]] with the violin pedagogue [[Ivan Galamian]] and his assistant [[Dorothy DeLay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/perlman-itzhak-biography |title=Perlman, Itzhak Biography: Contemporary Musicians |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perlman contracted [[polio]] at age four and has walked using leg braces and [[crutches]] since then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/I-woke-up-and-I-couldnt-walk-This-is-the-polio-that-should-become-just-a-memory-398720 |title='I WOKE UP AND I COULDN'T WALK': THIS IS THE POLIO THAT SHOULD BECOME JUST A MEMORY |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays the violin while seated. {{as of|2018}}, he uses crutches or an electric Amigo scooter for mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/how-they-roll.html |title=How They Roll |work=The New York Times |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, he began to tour widely. In addition to an extensive recording and performance career, he has continued to make guest appearances on American television shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' as well as playing at a number of functions at the [[White House]].

Although he has never been billed or marketed as a singer, he sang the role of "Un carceriere" ("a jailer") on a 1981 [[EMI]] recording of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini's]] "[[Tosca]]" that featured [[Renata Scotto]], [[Plácido Domingo]], and [[Renato Bruson]], with [[James Levine]] conducting. He had earlier sung the role in an excerpt from the opera on a 1980 Pension Fund Benefit Concert telecast as part of the [[Live from Lincoln Center]] series with [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Cavaradossi and [[Zubin Mehta]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].

On 5 July 1986, he performed on the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the [[Statue of Liberty]], which was televised live on [[ABC Television]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn |title=Liberty Receives Classical Salute, Sun Sentinel, July 5, 1986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223012824/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-05/features/8602090161_1_liberty-weekend-liberty-festivities-great-lawn |archivedate=23 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra, conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], performed in [[Central Park]].

In 1987, he joined the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] (IPO) for their concerts in [[Warsaw]] and [[Budapest]] as well as other cities in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. He toured with the IPO in the spring of 1990 for its first-ever performance in the [[Soviet Union]], with concerts in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], and toured with the IPO again in 1994, performing in China and India.

In 2015 on a classical music program entitled ''The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center'' produced by [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] in New York City, it was revealed that Perlman performed the uncredited violin solo on the 1989 [[Billy Joel]] song [[The Downeaster Alexa]].

While primarily a solo artist, Perlman has performed with a number of other musicians, including [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Pinchas Zukerman]], [[Jessye Norman]], [[Isaac Stern]], and [[Yuri Temirkanov]] at the 150th anniversary celebration of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in Leningrad in December 1990. He has also performed and recorded with his friend and fellow Israeli violinist [[Pinchas Zukerman]] on numerous occasions over the years.

As well as playing and recording the classical music for which he is best known, Perlman has also played [[jazz]], including an album made with jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]], and in addition, [[klezmer]]. Perlman has been a soloist for a number of film scores such as the theme of the [[1993 film]] ''[[Schindler's List]]'' by [[John Williams]], which subsequently won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. More recently, he was the violin soloist for the [[2005 film]] ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' along with cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. Perlman played selections from the musical scores of the movies nominated for "Best Original Score" at the [[73rd Academy Awards]] with [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Selected performances===
[[File:ItzhakPerlmanWhitehouse2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perlman at the White House in 2007]]
Perlman played at the state dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 2007, in the East Room at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=News releases for May 2007 | url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/images/20070507_p050707sc-1032-1-515h.html | publisher=The White House | date=7 May 2007 | accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed [[John Williams]]'s "[[Air and Simple Gifts]]" at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|2009 inauguration ceremony]] for [[Barack Obama]] along with [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (cello), [[Gabriela Montero]] (piano), and [[Anthony McGill]] (clarinet).  While the quartet did play live, the music played simultaneously over speakers and on television was a recording made two days prior due to concerns over the cold weather damaging the instruments. Perlman was quoted as saying: "It would have been a disaster if we had done it any other way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/obama_inauguration/7846472.stm Quartet pre-recorded Obama music]. BBC News (23 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

He made an appearance in Disney's [[Fantasia 2000]] to introduce the segment [[Pines of Rome]] along with [[Steve Martin]].

On 2 November 2018, Perlman reprised the 60th anniversary of his first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show as a guest on [[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slippedisc.com/2018/11/60-years-on-itzhak-perlman-reprises-his-ed-sullivan-appearance/|title=60 Years On, Itzhak Perlman Reprises His Ed Sullivan Appearance.|date=2018-11-03|author=Norman Lebrecht|publisher=slippeddisc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
In 1975, Perlman accepted a faculty post at the Conservatory of Music at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 2003, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Perlman was named the holder of the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation Chair in Violin Studies at the Juilliard School, succeeding his teacher, [[Dorothy DeLay]]. He also currently teaches students one-on-one at the Perlman Music Program on Long Island, NY, rarely holding master classes.

===The Perlman Music Program===
The Perlman music program, founded in 1995 by Toby Perlman and Suki Sandler, started as a summer camp for exceptional string musicians between the ages of 11 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:fulltext:iimp00163565 |title=The Perlman Music Program: Toby's Project Grows and Grows |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, it expanded to a year-long program. Students have the chance to have Itzhak Perlman himself coach them before they play at venues such as the [[Sutton Place Synagogue]] and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:citation:iimp00170081 |title=Perlmans' Proteges: The Perlman Music Program |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By introducing students to each other and requiring them to practice together, the program strives to have musicians who would otherwise practice alone and develop a network of friends and colleagues. Rather than remain isolated, participants in the program find an area where they belong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:iimp:&amp;rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:fulltext:iimp00170084 |title=Perlman Student Stirling Trent |publisher=Strings |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting===
At the beginning of the new millennium, Perlman began to [[Conducting|conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=20000821&amp;id=VIhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lukMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1729,4990881|title=The Daily Gazette – Google News Archive Search|publisher=Google News|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the post of principal guest conductor at the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. He served as music advisor to the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] from 2002 to 2004. In November 2007, the [[Westchester Philharmonic]] announced the appointment of Perlman as artistic director and principal conductor. His first concert in these roles was on 11 October 2008, in an all-[[Beethoven]] program featuring pianist [[Leon Fleisher]] performing the [[Emperor Concerto]].

==Instruments==
Perlman plays the ''[[Soil Stradivarius]]'' violin of 1714, formerly owned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and considered one of the finest violins made during Stradivari's "golden period." Perlman also plays the [[Guarneri|Guarneri del Gesu 1743 'Sauret']]&lt;ref name="cozio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cozio.com/musician.aspx?id%3D107 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825190954/http://www.cozio.com/Musician.aspx?id=107 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kreisler Bergonzi|Carlo Bergonzi 1740 'ex-Kreisler']].

==Personal life==
Perlman resides in New York City with his wife, Toby, also a classically trained violinist. They have five children: Noah, [[Navah Perlman|Navah]], Leora, Rami, and Ariella. Perlman is a distant cousin of Canadian comic and TV personality [[Howie Mandel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/21/news/tv-61937 | title=New Afternoon Arrival | work=Los Angeles Times | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | author=Brownfield, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant Colonel]] '''John Masters''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[OBE]] (26 October 1914 – 7 May 1983) was a British officer of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] and later a novelist. His works are noted for their treatment of the [[British Empire]] in India.

==Life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
Masters was the son of a regular soldier, a [[lieutenant-colonel]] whose family had a long tradition of service in the Indian Army. He was educated at [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington]] and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. On graduating from Sandhurst in 1933, he was seconded to the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) for a year before applying to serve with the [[4th Gurkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. He saw service on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] with the 2nd battalion of the regiment, and was rapidly given a variety of appointments within the battalion and the regimental depot.

In 1938, he organised a hunt for a leopard reported to be roaming the depot at [[Bakloh]], only to find himself facing a full-grown tiger (which killed one of the Gurkhas acting as beaters). He later commented that whatever rank and decorations he was awarded, he was always known to the Gurkhas as "The Sahib who shot the Bakloh tiger".&lt;ref&gt;Bugles and a Tiger, pp.207-212&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1939, he was appointed the [[Adjutant]] of the 2nd battalion of the 4th Gurkhas. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] his battalion was sent to [[Basra]] in Iraq, during the brief [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]. Masters subsequently served in Iraq, [[Syria]], and [[Iran|Persia]] with the battalion, before being briefly seconded as a staff officer in a Line of Communications HQ. In early 1942, he attended the Indian Army's [[Command and Staff College|Staff College]] at [[Quetta]]. Here he met the wife of a fellow officer and they began an affair.  Even though they later married, there was something of a scandal at the time.

After passing the Staff College, Masters next served as [[brigade major]] in the [[114th Indian Infantry Brigade]] before being "poached" by [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Joe Lentaigne]], another officer from the 4th Gurkhas, to be brigade major in [[111th Indian Infantry Brigade]], a [[Chindit]] formation. From March, 1944, the brigade served behind the Japanese lines in [[Burma]]. On the death of General [[Orde Wingate]] on 24 April, Lentaigne became the Chindits' overall commander and Masters commanded the main body of 111 Brigade.

In May, the brigade was ordered to hold a position code-named ‘Blackpool’ near [[Mogaung]] in northern Burma. The isolated position was attacked with great intensity for seventeen days and eventually the brigade was forced to withdraw. Masters felt obliged to order the medical orderlies to shoot 19 of his own men, casualties who had no hope of recovery or rescue. Masters later wrote about these events in the second volume of his autobiography, ''The Road Past Mandalay''. In recognition of his "gallant and distinguished services in Burma", he was in October awarded the DSO&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/36730/supplement/4570/data.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

After briefly commanding the 3rd battalion of his regiment, Masters subsequently became GSO1 (the [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]]) of [[19th Infantry Division (India)|Indian 19th Infantry Division]], which was heavily involved in the [[Burma Campaign 1944-1945|later stages of the Burma Campaign]], until the end of the war. On January 17, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37433 |date=17 January 1946 |page=494 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was awarded an OBE for his service in Burma. After a spell as a staff officer in [[India Command|GHQ India]] in [[Delhi]], he then served as an instructor at the British Army [[Staff College, Camberley]]. He left the army after this posting, and moved to the United States, where he attempted to set up a business promoting walking tours in the [[Himalayas]], one of his hobbies.&lt;ref&gt;A recurrent theme in Masters's work is [[rock climbing]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The business was not a success and, to make ends meet, he decided to write of his experiences in the army. When his novels proved popular, he became a full-time writer.

In later life, Masters and his wife Barbara moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], USA. He died in 1983 from complications following heart surgery. His family and friends scattered his ashes from an aeroplane over the mountain trails he loved to hike. General Sir [[Hugh Michael Rose|Michael Rose]], the former UN commander in Bosnia, is a stepson of Masters.

==Personality==
''John Masters: a regimented life'' by John Clay was published by Michael Joseph in 1992. Now out of print, it is a sympathetic but not uncritical biography. According to Clay, Masters possessed a strong and sometimes domineering personality, and could be impatient with weakness or incompetence. He could also be extremely warmhearted and generous. His outgoing and boisterous personality flourished during his long residence in the United States. Masters was impatient with the literary establishment, which faulted his Indian novels as unsympathetic to Indians, and he was impatient with editors who wanted to remove the rough edges from his characters. Masters strove for accuracy and realism, resenting it when people mistook his characters' views as his own. He was extremely hard-working and meticulously well-organized, both as a soldier and a novelist. Clay speculates that Masters may have been driven to achieve by rumours that his family was not "pure" English, but [[Anglo-Indian]] or [[Eurasian]]. In 1962 Masters learned what he had apparently long suspected, that he did indeed have a distant Indian ancestor.

Clay's biography provides details that Masters omitted from the three volumes of autobiography he wrote: ''Bugles and a Tiger'' (1956); ''Road Past Mandalay'' (1961); and ''Pilgrim Son'' (1971). They are nevertheless extremely revealing.  ''Bugles and a Tiger'', details Masters's time at Sandhurst and service on India's northwest frontier on the eve of the Second World War.  ''Road Past Mandalay'' deals mostly with the Burma campaign in the War, while ''Pilgrim Son'' chronicles his career as a writer.

==Literary works and controversy over them==

===Treatment of British rule in India===
Apart from the autobiographical works mentioned above, Masters is also known for his historical novels set in India. Seven of these portray members of successive generations of the Savage family serving in the British and Indian Armies in India, in an attempt to trace the history of the British in India through the life of one family. In chronological order of events (but not in order of publication) these novels are:

*''[[Coromandel!]]'' (1955) A 17th-century English lad runs away to sea and ends up in India.
*''[[The Deceivers]]'' (1952) An English officer goes undercover to root out the ritual murders of [[Thuggee]].
*''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]'' (1951) The [[Sepoy Mutiny]] of 1857.
*''[[The Lotus and the Wind]]'' (1953) [[The Great Game]] of British and Russian agents on the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|Northwest Frontier]].
*''[[Far, Far the Mountain Peak]]'' (1957) [[Mountaineering]] and the [[World War I|First World War]].
*''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' (1954) Britain's exodus and the [[Partition of India]].
*''[[To the Coral Strand]]'' (1962) An ex-officer refuses to go gracefully after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].
*''[[The Ravi Lancers]]'' (1972) An offshoot of the series, set in the First World War, with one of the protagonists related to the Savages but having a different name.

One of Masters's last Indian novels, ''[[The Venus of Konpara]]'', is notable for the fact that its principal characters are Indians. The Savage family play no role in the storyline, though it is hinted that a minor unidentified character is a family member. It is set in the nineteenth century during the British ''Raj'', but explores the history of [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] identities in the country.

Masters's works are not without their critics, who often characterize his work as historically revisionist or as uncritical of the Empire. Typical are the observations of Ronald Brydon: "For us, the saga of the Savages, heroes and conquistadors of the Raj, was a political pornography in which we savoured the illicit sensualities of [[imperialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=10161 poetrymagazines.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, both ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]'' and ''[[The Ravi Lancers]]'' contain sympathetic portrayals of Indian nationalists and portray irreconcilable tensions between British and Indian characters that mirror the conflicts inherent in British India in a manner comparable to [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]''. The descendant of the hero of the former novel (who is in practice manifestly the same character) experiences the [[partition of India]] with a resigned detachment and later undergoes a deep personal crisis which ends with his staying on in independent India rather than returning to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/13/stories/2004091300440200.htm hindu.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One Indian novelist ([[Khushwant Singh]]) remarked that while [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] understood India, John Masters understood Indians.&lt;ref&gt;''Pilgrim Son'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===
The best-known film is probably ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), which concerns the [[Partition of India]] and the [[Anglo-Indian]] community. It starred [[Ava Gardner]]. Four of the novels (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th &amp; 6th in the series) were adapted for an 18-part serial in [[BBC Radio 4]]'s Classic Serial slot, being broadcast from October 1984 to January 1985. ''[[The Venus of Konpara]]'' had also been dramatised for BBC Radio in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/lost3.html Lost BBC radio plays 1988-1970]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Deceivers (film)|''The Deceivers'']] was filmed in 1988 and starred [[Pierce Brosnan]].

===Other themes===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Masters's trilogy of ''Now God Be Thanked'', ''Heart of War'', and ''In The Green Of The Spring'' has some claim to be considered his magnum opus, covering the changes to various segments of British society wrought by the upheavals of the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ravi Lancers'' is also set in the First World War, but concerns the exploits of an Indian regiment, the commander of which is related to the Savage family.&lt;/ref&gt; Masters's book ''Man of War'' appears to have been the first of a planned trilogy on the Second World War; however, the author died before any other connected books were published.

In the 1950s and 1960s the books of Masters sold in large numbers, particularly ''Bhowani Junction'', which was also translated into various other languages. Some of his works are now out of print.

'''Joseph Huntley was a biscuit and cake maker in the 19th century, which grew to become the largest biscuit firm in the world with his son, Thomas Palmer.'''

business

At this time, London Street was the main [[stage coach]] route from [[London]] to [[Bristol]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and the [[West Country]]. One of the main calling points of the stage coaches was the Crown Inn, opposite Joseph Huntley's shop and he started selling his biscuits to the travellers on the coaches.  Because the biscuits were vulnerable to breakage on the coach journey, he started putting them in a metal tin. Out of this innovation grew two businesses: Joseph (the elder's) biscuit shop that was to become the famous biscuit manufacturer [[Huntley &amp; Palmers]], and [[Huntley, Bourne and Stevens]], a firm of biscuit tin manufacturers founded by his younger son, also called Joseph. In 1838, Joseph Huntley was forced by ill-health to retire, handing control of the shop to his older son Thomas Huntley, who was joined in partnership by [[George Palmer (businessman)|George Palmer]].{{ref|rhthp1}}

[[File:Kalakaua, reprinted by E. Linde (ca. 1881).jpg|thumb|King Kalākaua]]
The 1881 world tour of King [[Kalākaua]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was his attempt to save the [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian culture]] and population from extinction by importing a labor force from [[Asia-Pacific]] nations. His efforts brought the small island nation to the attention of world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. Critics in Hawaii believed the labor negotiations were just an excuse to see the world. The 281-day trip gave Kalākaua the distinction of being the first monarch to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe; his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a [[State dinner#United States|state dinner]] at the [[White House]].

Kalākaua met with heads of state in Asia, the Mideast and Europe, to encourage an influx of [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|sugar plantation]] labor in family groups, as well as unmarried women as potential brides for Hawaii's existing contract laborers. While in Asia, he tried to forestall American ambitions by offering a plan to [[Emperor Meiji]] for putting Hawaii under the protection of the [[Empire of Japan]] with an arranged marriage between his niece [[Kaʻiulani]] and a Japanese prince. On his visit to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], he negotiated a treaty of friendship and commerce with Hawaii that would provide a legal framework for the emigration of Portuguese  laborers to Hawaii. The King had an audience in Rome with [[Pope Leo XIII]] and met with many of the crowned heads of Europe. Britain's [[Queen Victoria]] and the splendor of her royal life impressed him more than any other monarchy; having been greatly affected by the ornate trappings of European sovereigns, he would soon have Hawaii's monarchy mirror that grandeur.

The King traveled with no security guards; only a small group of personal friends made the journey with him. Except for land transportation in cities, and two loaned ships in China and the US, his modes of transportation were seldom reserved exclusively for him. He shared regularly scheduled steamships and rail transport with fare-paying passengers. On the [[Red Sea]], he played cards and danced with other passengers. Like other tourists, he visited the [[White elephant (animal)#Thailand|white elephants of Siam]], the [[Giza pyramid complex]] in Egypt, tourist sites in India, and museums in Europe. Along the way, he exceeded his original budget, shopping regardless, and sent letters back home.

President [[James A. Garfield]] died four days before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a courtesy call to newly inaugurated President [[Chester A. Arthur]] at the White House in [[Washington, D.C.]] There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at [[Coney Island]]. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with [[Thomas Edison]] to see a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's [[Fort Monroe]]. He toured [[Hampton University|Hampton Normal and Agricultural School]], and shopped for [[Equine industry in Kentucky|horses in Kentucky]]. The royal party boarded a train to [[California]], where they were house guests of [[Claus Spreckels]] at his estate in [[Aptos, California|Aptos]] (near Santa Cruz), and spent a few days seeing the sights before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in [[Iolani Palace]], a public coronation for himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.

Emma and Kalākaua were political opponents in the second election following the death of the childless [[Lunalilo]], the first elected Hawaiian monarch.{{refn|{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1953|p=239}}}} Later, in her personal diary, Queen Emma described the 1881 trip as "his tour of pleasure &amp; self-praise".{{refn|{{harvnb|Kanahele|1999|p=326}}}}}} Kalākaua supposedly had the intention in 1874 of making a world tour "for his personal gratification and vanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaeo|Queen Emma|1976|pages=299–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were officially the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] but had generally been known as the Sandwich Islands since the 1778 visit of Captain [[James Cook]]. The estimated population of [[Native Hawaiians]] when Cook arrived was 800,000. With the [[Whaling in the United States#Expansion|arrival of whaling ships]] and missionaries in the early 19th century, the Native Hawaiians were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity and began dying in large numbers. The official 1878 census showed only 44,088 individuals who claimed Hawaiian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDermott|Andrade|2011|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thrum1881&gt;{{harvnb|Thrum|1881|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sugar plantation work force in the islands and the dwindling population of the Hawaiian race had been Kalākaua's ongoing concerns. On December 24, 1880, he signed an act of the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii|legislative assembly]] acknowledging corruption in the immigration system and authorizing Minister of the Interior [[Henry A. P. Carter]] to take charge of licensing immigration brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By Authority|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-01-08/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Immediately following the signing of the legislation, he visited each major island in the kingdom for a personal look at how the reciprocity treaty had affected his people. In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, "I will speak to you of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements of all our industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population."&lt;ref name=Kauai&gt;{{cite news|title=His Majesty on Kauai|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-01-08/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

During the week, the King and Judd were made honorary members of the Pacific Yacht Club in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]] at a reception hosted by Commodore R. S. Floyd. Kalākaua was also feted at a gala in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]], given by the Chinese Consul-General and attended by leaders of the local Chinese community. It was Armstrong who delivered the after-dinner speech and offered a toast to continued good relations with the Chinese population in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Feb26/&gt;

In response to Kalākaua's expressed fondness for music and the company of women, "The Ladies of the Palace Hotel" threw a formal-attire grand ball in his honor. A news commentary on the California visit stated, "…&amp;nbsp; it may be said that every hour of King Kalākaua's stay in San Francisco has been filled up with a grand ovation of activities."&lt;ref name=Feb26/&gt;

The party sailed on the ''Oceanic'' out of San Francisco on February 8. Reaching the [[Empire of Japan]] on March 4, they were surprised by elaborate welcoming ceremonies that included the playing of the anthem Kalākaua had written, "[[Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī]]". They had not given advance notice to the Japanese government of their pending visit, but the government had been alerted by a telegraph from the Imperial General Consul in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing a formal reception was required by their 1871 treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii, they welcomed the King as a friendly head of state.

The King and his small group spent just under three weeks on their tour of Japan.

The following day [[Emperor Meiji]] held a state dinner for his visitors. The Emperor presented the King with two suits of [[Japanese armour|Japanese armor]], and bestowed upon him the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]] with Badge, and the Star of the Order.

Concern over a possible United States seizure of the Hawaiian Islands motivated Kalākaua to hold a secret meeting with the Emperor to bring Hawaii under the protective aegis of the Japanese empire. He proposed to unite the two nations with an arranged marriage between his 5-year-old niece [[Kaʻiulani]] and 13-year-old [[Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito]].{{refn|group=FN|Also known as Prince Fushimi Sadamaro or Prince Yamashina Sadamaro.{{refn|{{harvnb|Marumoto|1976|pp=57–58}}}}}} Historian [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall|Ralph Kuykendall]] said the proposal was rejected both by Yorihito, upon advice of his father, and by the government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaiian king also recommended that Emperor Meiji create a "Union and Federation of the Asiatic nations and sovereigns" with Japan as its head, although the Emperor politely declined this idea at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese newspapers cautioned about looking for an emigrating labor force in Japan, stating that their own country had large areas of available agricultural land that went untouched. A ball was planned in the king's honor by the Masonic Fraternity of Yokohama, which he bowed out of when he learned of the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia]]. The Kalākaua group arrived in [[Kobe]] on March 18 for a sightseeing tour and lunch with the mayor. On March 22, they embarked on the steamship ''Tokio Maru'' bound for Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Tour1/&gt;

The Chinese had been a part of Hawaii's culture since the late 18th century, when the islands were first visited by Chinese merchants and tradesmen. In 1852, sugar plantations began recruiting unskilled labor from China. Because these men initially intended to return to China upon the completion of their contracts, most came without families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDermott|Andrade|2011|pp=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in [[Shanghai]] on March 25, Kalākaua spent two days in residence at the [[Astor House Hotel (Shanghai)|Astor House Hotel]], receiving foreign diplomats. They departed for [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] on March 27 when [[Viceroy of Zhili|Viceroy]] [[Li Hongzhang|Li Hung Chang]] offered the steamship ''Pautah'' for their use.&lt;ref name=LastDays&gt;{{cite news|title=The King's Tour Around the World: Last Days in Japan|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-06-11/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Kalākaua met with the Viceroy on March 31 to propose the emigration of unmarried Chinese women, as well as Chinese family units to Hawaii, to counterbalance the labor population of unmarried Chinese men. The Viceroy responded favorably and agreed to co-sponsor such an emigration with the Hawaiian government. Li arranged several events to provide Kalākaua the opportunity to meet the city's influential persons. A copy of a draft of a proposed treaty was forwarded to Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Green.&lt;ref name=LastDays/&gt; The ''Hong Kong Daily News'' held a positive view of Hawaii's treatment of existing Chinese laborers, but stated that the Chinese government needed to provide financial assistance for family emigration to Hawaii. The royal party returned to Shanghai on April 6. A proposed trip to [[Beijing]] was aborted when [[Empress Dowager Ci'an]] died on April 8.

By the time the ''Bangkok'' docked in [[Singapore]] on May 6, Kalākaua had had enough of formal events, turning down the offer of accommodations at [[Istana (Singapore)|Government House]] in favor of the simplicity of a hotel. Nevertheless, Governor [[Frederick Weld]] held a formal reception and state dinner for him.&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

A change of transportation at [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]] put them on the steamship ''Pembo'' (or ''Pamba''), arriving in [[Yangon|Rangoon]] on May 22. During their stopover, they were entertained at Government House by the English Commissioner, and Kalākaua attended worship services at the chapel of St. John's College. They departed on May 24.&lt;ref name=Indiaetc/&gt;

=== India: May 28 – June 7 ===
Several plantation owners in Hawaii favored the importation of [[coolie]] labor from the [[East India]] region.{{refn|group=FN|States and territories of East India in 1881: [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Odisha]], [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]}} Henry A. P. Carter and British consul [[James Hay Wodehouse]] had already visited England in 1879 to open a door for the process. They were discouraged by stipulations that Hawaii would be forced to pass legislation that would in essence be a detailed labor contract. There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could not be changed without the approval of the governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pp=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any negotiations for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India.&lt;ref name=AReport/&gt; They arrived in [[Calcutta]] on May 28 and visited the [[Alipore Zoological Gardens]]. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the [[British Raj|British India]] subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the [[Middle East]], and they stopped to tour the [[Ellora Caves]] prior to reaching [[Mumbai|Bombay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellora Caves|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/243|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=December 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209142802/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/243|archivedate=December 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the [[Parsi]] [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]], and a visit from businessman [[Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, 3rd Baronet|Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]].&lt;ref name=Indiaetc/&gt;

== Egypt: June 20–25 ==
The steamship ''Rosetta'' sailed out of Bombay on June 7, carrying Kalākaua and his friends to [[Aden]] for an afternoon of shopping on June 14, and then onto the [[Red Sea]]. In a letter to Liliʻuokalani, Kalākaua described how his romantic boyhood dreams of sailing the Red Sea were dashed by the tedium of a week on the water with no land in sight. All was not lost, since he and the estimated 70 other passengers passed the week playing games and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at the [[Suez]] on June 20, they boarded a train for [[Cairo]]. With no existing treaty with Egypt, they were pleasantly surprised by [[Khedive]] [[Tewfik Pasha]]'s offer of his Cairo palace during their stay, accommodating them with a tour of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramid complex]] and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] on the [[Giza Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pp=175, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing to his sister Liliʻuokalani from Cairo, he responded to her letter apprising him of the [[smallpox]] epidemic in the islands: "…&amp;nbsp;what is the use of praying after 293 lives of our poor people have gone to their everlasting place. Is it to thank him for killing or is it to thank him for sending them to him or to the other place&amp;nbsp;… To save the life of the people is to work and not pray."&lt;ref name="Kalakaua 1971 90"/&gt;

The ''Egyptian Gazette'' published Kalākaua's acceptance speech when the Grand Lodge of Egypt freemasons made him Honorary Grand Master of the Great Orient of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored with a state ball in [[Alexandria]] by the Khedive on June 24, the day before they left on the steamer ''Asia''.&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite news|title=The King's Tour Round the World: In Egypt-Italy-Paris-London|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-08-13/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

== Europe: June 29 – September 13 ==
Throughout their European stops, Armstrong saw a willingness among some who were looking for a life change to consider emigrating to Hawaii as plantation labor. Generally, however, they were looking for a stake in land ownership that the kingdom was not willing to offer.&lt;ref name=AReport/&gt;

=== Italy: June 29 – July 4 ===
Armstrong mentioned a brief stop at [[Catania]], on the island of [[Sicily]], probably on June 29, visiting the [[Catania Cathedral]] and [[Mount Etna]].{{refn|group=FN|No other source has mentioned this, and Armstrong did not specify a date. In his letters home, Kalākaua never mentioned Sicily, although he says they arrived in [[Naples]] at 11 a.m. on June 30. According to the [[Rick Steves]]' Europe website, a current-day ferry ride between [[Catania]] and Naples is a 12-hour trip, so the sightseeing on Catania had to have been the previous day.{{refn|{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pp=196–197}}}}{{refn|{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|p=91}}}}{{refn|{{cite web|title=Booking a Ferry Between Naples and Catania|url=https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/italy/booking-a-ferry-between-naples-and-catania#bottom|website=Rick Steves' Europe|publisher=Rick Steves' Europe, Inc.|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}}}}} Their next stop was at [[Naples]] on June 30,&lt;ref name=Europe/&gt; where they were greeted by the Prefect of Naples, the Commanding General and Admiral of Naples, and [[Celso Caesar Moreno]], presenting himself to local officials as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii.

Armstrong described him as someone who scammed his way into Kalākaua's good graces in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno had been appointed Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1880. He created a divisive situation that put the King at odds with his own cabinet, leading to Moreno's dismissal five days later. He and Kalākaua remained on cordial terms. Moreno had been appointed the guardian of three Hawaiian students, including the future rebel leaders [[Robert Napuʻuako Boyd]] and [[Robert William Wilcox]], who were being educated in Italy as a part of the government funded study-abroad program. Moreno was relieved of that responsibility once the King was made aware that Moreno had misrepresented them as Kalākaua's natural sons, and that he had misled the Italian government into believing he had an official position with the Hawaiian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pp=205–222, 232}}; {{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|pp=80, 90–92}}; {{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Saturday Press'' in Honolulu was indignant at his association with Kalākaua and their re-connection in Italy, stating that Moreno "…&amp;nbsp;had fought to the last ditch, and has, we hope, tumbled into it and will remain there."&lt;ref name=Naples&gt;{{cite news|title=C.

Their time in [[Rome]] was a brief two days, during which Kalākaua, Armstrong, and Judd were granted an audience with [[Pope Leo XIII]] on July 3. After receiving his blessing, they toured [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and other local tourist sites, and left the following day by train.&lt;ref name=Europe/&gt; The party traveled across France and Paris without informing the French authorities, which was seen as a breach of official protocol and had to be explained at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pages=212–213}}; {{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalākaua group arrived in [[London]] the evening of July 6. The King spent the next day receiving visitors in his suite at [[Claridge's]], later accepting [[Queen Victoria]]'s offer of the royal box at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]].

He insisted on giving Kalākaua precedence ahead of his brother-in-law, the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Germany]] and responded to German objections by saying, "Either the brute is a king or else he is an ordinary black nigger, and if he is not a king, why is he here?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cannadine|first1=David|title=Ornamentalism: How the British Saw Their Empire|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195157949|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daDh_x2Ne_wC&amp;pg=PA8|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428061441/https://books.google.com/books?id=daDh_x2Ne_wC&amp;pg=PA8|archivedate=April 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hibbert|first1=Christopher|title=Edward VII: The Last Victorian King|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781403983770|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xv4VdYIGLAoC&amp;pg=PA147|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051053/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xv4VdYIGLAoC&amp;pg=PA147|archivedate=April 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baycroft|first1=Timothy|last2=Hewitson|first2=Mark|title=What Is a Nation?: Europe 1789-1914|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191516283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VG01nx2vezoC&amp;pg=PA326|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428063555/https://books.google.com/books?id=VG01nx2vezoC&amp;pg=PA326|archivedate=April 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchwell|first1=Sarah|last2=Smith|first2=Thomas Ruys|title=Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers: From Charlotte Temple to The Da Vinci Code|date=2012|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441162168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qubh7e5XW0kC&amp;pg=PA201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in their trip, Armstrong temporarily returned to his family in the United States.&lt;ref name=KK9397&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|pp=93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii's relationship with A. Hoffnung &amp; Company in London dated back to 1877 when Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Henry A. P. Carter recommended the firm to handle Portuguese emigration to the island kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pp=124–125, 143–44, }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's founder Abraham Hoffnung was attached to the Hawaiian Board of Immigration in London, and had already succeeded in sending Hawaii 751 Portuguese citizens (237 men, 191 women, and 323 children) in 1879.&lt;ref name=Kuykendall125&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalākaua reconnected with Hoffnung over dinner, and he became part of the royal party as it traveled through Europe.&lt;ref name=WelcomeHome/&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

Kalākaua and Judd left England on July 24, arriving in [[Brussels]] the next morning. They spent a few days sightseeing, and visited [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], where [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] had been [[Battle of Waterloo|defeated in 1815]].

They arrived at [[Cologne]] on July 29, visiting the [[Cologne Cathedral]] before continuing on to [[Berlin]]. Kalākaua stayed in his Berlin accommodations and took care of his correspondence the first full day of his stay, with German soldiers standing vigil outside his door. He received boisterous expressions of public approval wherever he appeared. During their stay, they attended several military displays and toured museums, castles, and other sites of interest. The King was entertained by the future [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and his wife, who were receiving him on behalf of Wilhelm's grandfather, the [[William I, German Emperor|German Emperor]]. On a visit to [[Potsdam]] with [[Prince Charles of Prussia]], Kalākaua was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Red Eagle]]. Armstrong rejoined the group in Germany, but was too ill to accompany them on their outings.

=== Vienna, Austria: August 5–8 ===
Onlookers gathered at Vienna's {{Ill|Wien Nordwest railway station|de|Wien Nordwestbahnhof|WD=|lt=Northwest station}} in anticipation of Kalākaua's arrival. When he stepped off the train to be escorted by Austrian officials to the [[Hotel Imperial]], cheering rang out from the crowd. He later visited the Imperial Arsenal. After a tour of the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]], he attended a concert conducted by [[Eduard Strauss]] at the [[Volksgarten, Vienna|Volksgarten]].

The royal family had already left Vienna for the summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Kalākaua got to inspect the troops during military maneuvers at the [[Schmelz (Vienna)|Schmelz]] parade grounds. He later had an audience with [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen]]. In the evening, he returned to the opera house for a performance of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. The next two days were spent sightseeing, including the [[Schönbrunn Palace]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], the [[Votive Church, Vienna|Votive Church]], and the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.&lt;ref name=Vienna/&gt;

On August 8, the King and his friends took the evening train to Paris.&lt;ref name=Vienna/&gt;

The Royal party arrived at the [[Gare de l'Est (Paris Métro)|Gare de l'Est]] train station in Paris in the pre-dawn hours of August 10, rejoined by Macfarlane. Most of the first day they remained in their suite, recovering from travel exhaustion. They soon ventured out to see to the [[Auteuil Hippodrome]], and stopped by various concert halls.&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite news|title=The King's Tour Round the World: The King is in Paris|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-10-08/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Armstrong noted that the party was received with "the [[cold shoulder]]"&lt;ref name=AK/&gt; by diplomatic authorities for the first time on their trip, while the King in return considered them to be a "mean lot".&lt;ref name=AK/&gt; They had to apologize for the diplomatic slight from the earlier July stopover, and explain the reason why an invitation for the King, received while they were still in London, to attend the [[Bastille Day]] celebration as a guest of [[Jules Grévy|President Grévy]] was left unanswered. After the tension was smoothed out, the [[Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire|French foreign minister]] visited the King in the absence of the president who was not in the capital at that time.&lt;ref name=AK&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1904|pages=258–260}}; {{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, their stay in Paris was filled with well-wishers who came to call at the hotel. Queen Victoria sent her [[chargé d'affaires]] to present him with the Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]]. After days of visitors, which included world dignitaries and representatives of two different Masonic lodges, Kalākaua and friends attended a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Aida]]''. He was given a tour of the headquarters of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', and visited the [[Société de géographie]]. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, left on the evening train, bound for Portugal and Spain.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

Portuguese immigrants had been in Hawaii since the whaling days. Many of them were mixed blood [[Afro-Portuguese]] sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDermott|Andrade|2011|pp=81–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thrum|Marques|1886|pp=74–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They departed for Paris on August 25.&lt;ref name=WelcomeHome/&gt;

=== Revisiting Paris: August 27–30 ===
Winding down his tour, Kalākaua's schedule became less hectic. He spent most of August 27 relaxing in his hotel suite in Paris, and attending to his personal correspondence. A little sightseeing was done over the next two days: Napoleon's tomb at [[Les Invalides]], [[Bal Mabille]], the [[Louvre]], and [[Palais Bourbon]]. Dutch heir-apparent [[Alexander, Prince of Orange]], visited the King to thank him for the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalākaua. The King spent his remaining day in the city, August 30, in his hotel suite, saying his farewells.&lt;ref name=WelcomeHome/&gt;

Armstrong left for New York City on September 1, as the rest of the party went sightseeing and visited the tomb of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The following day they visited the [[Tower of London]], and later in the day, Kalākaua received the Holy Cross of Wasa from Sweden's chargé d'affaires. On September 3, the royal party visited the Blenheim Gun and Small Arms Works, where they lunched with several dignitaries. After services at St Paul's Cathedral, Kalākaua bestowed the [[Royal Order of Kalākaua]] on Hoffnung for his service during their travels around Europe. On September 6, he paid a farewell visit to the Prince and Princess of Wales, before departing for Glasgow, Scotland.&lt;ref name=WelcomeHome/&gt;

=== Scotland: September 7–13 ===
Kalākaua arrived in [[Glasgow]] on September 7. The [[Lord Provost of Glasgow]] and the magistrates hosted the King at a dinner party, where he gave a speech praising the contributions of Scotsmen in Hawaii. For the rest of his stay, he toured [[Loch Lomond]] and the [[River Clyde]]. Visiting [[Edinburgh]] on September 9, he toured [[Dreghorn Castle]] and [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|the Royal Botanic Garden]], where he planted two maple trees. Kalākaua appeared at Freemason Hall to loud cheers. The Grand Conclave of Scotland of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine made him an honorary member.&lt;ref name=WelcomeHome/&gt;

The palace was opened for the public to personally greet the King.

In an attempt to protect the interests of the United States, Blaine made it clear to British diplomat [[Edward Thornton (diplomat)|Edward Thornton]] that priority on annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess [[Likelike]], her husband [[Archibald Scott Cleghorn]], Liliʻuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis.

The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' quoted Armstrong's response that the rumors were "frivolous and utterly false".&lt;ref name=KKTour/&gt; Immediately below the quote from Armstrong was a different twist on the rumor from San Francisco, also dated July 16, and printed as fact. Sourced to "a number of the most prominent planters and merchants from the Sandwich Islands",&lt;ref name=KKTour/&gt; it alleged a scheme by the King and Celso Caesar Moreno to import 1,000,000 Chinese men (but no women), conferring instant citizenship upon them, and reaping a $7 per head tax.

Upon their return trip to New York, ''[[New York Sun|The Sun]]'' newspaper quoted Judd about the rumor of the Hawaiian Islands being for sale: "…&amp;nbsp;there is no truth in it whatsoever. It is perfectly absurd."&lt;ref name=NY924 /&gt; Dismissing the issue of possible annexation, Judd pinpointed the source as coming from England: "This was thought to be such a serious matter that the British government sent two men of war to Honolulu."&lt;ref name=NY924/&gt;

The United States passed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1882 to deal with what was believed to be an excess of Chinese labor-class immigrants, in particular in California. Many who were already in the United States, or were en route, went to Hawaii, and the islands were flooded with Chinese men. In 1883, between March and May, 3,400 Chinese male laborers arrived in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaiian legislature then restricted immigration of Chinese men to 2,400 per year. Between 1878 and 1884, the population of Chinese laborers in Hawaii tripled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nordyke|Lee|1989|pp=199–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong's report was dismissive of any possibility of immigration from India, specifically East India.

=== Kalākaua ===
Not everybody was enthusiastic about Kalākaua's journey. In ''Hawaii's Story'', Liliʻuokalani defended her brother's efforts against those who she felt "grossly misjudged and even slandered"&lt;ref name=L7678&gt;{{harvnb|Liliʻuokalani|1898|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; him. She gave no names, but said there were those who believed, or wanted to persuade others to believe, that Kalākaua was using labor immigration as a cover story to gratify his selfish desire to see the world.&lt;ref name=L7678/&gt;

The 1881 year-end retrospective of the ''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' was focused on Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what the impact of the tour would be, but looked optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave much credit to Liliʻuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained respect for her performance as temporary Regent. Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention. He was praised for his personal qualities of leadership and personality, as well as for his positive interaction with global leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Year 1881|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-12-31/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress.|publisher=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|date=December 31, 1881|location=Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller section in same day's newspaper noted that since the journey, there had been a global increase of literary publications pertaining to Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Hawaiian Literature|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-12-31/ed-1/seq-6/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress.|publisher=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|date=December 31, 1881|location=Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883'' reported Kalākaua's tour expense appropriated by the government as $22,500,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thrum|1883|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|pp=90–91, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliʻuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy for the education of the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalakaua|1971|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elaborate style of European monarchies left a favorable impression on Kalākaua. Construction on [[Iolani Palace]] had begun in 1879, and was ongoing when Kalākaua was touring the world, with an appropriation from the legislature of $80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was not fully completed until December 1882, the King was living there prior to his departure on his world tour.{{refn|group=FN|Liliʻuokalani, ''Hawaii's Story'': "In the early part of the month of January, 1881, a message through the telephone reached me at my private residence at Washington Place, that my presence was required immediately at Iolani Palace." {{refn|{{harvnb|Liliʻuokalani|1898|p=75}}}}}} The influence of European palaces was reflected in the interior design and expensive furnishings. The final cost was $343,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iolani palace nomination form|author=Ben Levy|work=National Register of Historic Places|date=December 1985|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|url={{NHLS url|id=66000293}}|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately upon completion, the King invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|p=262}}; {{cite news|title=Grand Masonic Banquet|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1882-12-30/ed-1/seq-5/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Electric lighting did not come to Honolulu for another 3{{frac|2}} years, when Iolani Palace led the way with the first electric lights in the kingdom. The monarchy invited the public to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies, and 5,000 people showed up. The [[Royal Hawaiian Band]] entertained, refreshments were served, and the King on horseback paraded his troops around the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric Light|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1886-07-22/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=December 27, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

These expenses were not the sole cause of the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], which Kalākaua was forced to sign, but representative of a pattern of excessive spending and grand schemes, under the helm of [[Walter Murray Gibson]], that did lead to it. Gibson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs for two non-consecutive terms, on May 20, 1882, and again on October 13, 1886. He became Minister of the Interior and [[Kuhina Nui|Prime Minister of Hawaii]] on June 30, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pp=143, 158, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson encouraged and approved the King's excessive expenditures, and is thought to have been the driving force behind some of them, not the least of which was the $100,000 purchase of a state steamboat for travel to the [[Samoan Islands]] as part of Kalākaua's plan to form a Polynesian Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pp=300, 312–313, 324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Navekmisal Hanım''' ({{circa}} 1838 – 5 August 1854; {{lang-ota|ناوك مثال خانم}}) was a consort of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==
Navekmisal Hanım was born in the Biberd family in [[North Caucasus]]. Her father was Prince Rüstem Bey Biberd and her mother was Princess Fatma Hanım Kızılbek, the daughter of Prince Batuhan Kızılbek. She had a sister named, Suzidilara Hanım (died 1919).{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=60}} 

Fatma Hanım's sister, Princess Keşfiraz Hanım, hence a close relative, had been a wetnurse to Princess [[Refia Sultan]], daughter of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]]. For this reasons Navekmisal and her sister were sent to live with her at Istanbul. Navekmisal grew into a young lady in the [[Imperial Harem]]. She entered palace service and became [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Valide Sultan]] [[Bezmiâlem Sultan]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=59}} 

Navekmisal married Abdulmejid in 1853. She was given the title of "Beşinci Ikbal".{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=215}} She remained childless.{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=60}}

==Death==
In early 1854, she had fallen victim to the epidemic of tuberculosis then raging in Istanbul in the nineteenth century. She died on 5 August 1854, at Şemsipaşa Palace located at Üsküdar. She is buried in the Mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|New Mosque]], [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=215}}{{sfn|Necdet|2007|page=603}}{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=60}}

The term ''Naga'' in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] denotes divine, semi-divine deities, or a semi-divine race of half-human half-serpent beings that resides in the heavenly ''[[Patala]]'' (netherworld) and can occasionally take human form.

==Etymology==
{{Wikispecies|Naja naja}}
In Sanskrit, a {{IAST|nāgá}} ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:नाग#Sanskrit|नाग]]}}) is a [[cobra]], the [[Indian cobra]] (''Naja naja''). A synonym for ''{{IAST|nāgá}}'' is ''{{IAST|phaṇin}}'' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:फणिन्#Sanskrit|फणिन्]]}}). There are several words for "snake" in general, and one of the very commonly used ones is ''{{IAST|sarpá}}'' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:सर्प#Sanskrit|सर्प]]}}). Sometimes the word ''{{IAST|nāgá}}'' is also used generically to mean "snake".&lt;ref name=Apte&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apte|first1=Vaman Shivram|title=The student's English-Sanskrit dictionary|date=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-0299-3|edition=3rd rev. &amp; enl.}}, p. 423. The first definition of ''nāgaḥ'' given reads "A snake in general, particularly the cobra." p.539&lt;/ref&gt; The word is [[cognate]] with English 'snake', Germanic: ''*snēk-a-'', [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-IE]]: *(s)nēg-o- (with [[Indo-European s-mobile|s-mobile]]).&lt;ref&gt;Proto-IE: *(s)nēg-o-, Meaning: snake, Old Indian: nāgá- m.

{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
The mythological serpent race that took form as cobras often can be found in Hindu iconography. The nāgas are described as the powerful, splendid, wonderful and proud semidivine race that can assume their physical form either as human, partial human-serpent or the whole serpent. Their domain is in the enchanted underworld, the underground realm filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures called Naga-loka or Patala-loka. They are also often associated with bodies of waters — including rivers, lakes, seas, and wells — and are guardians of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/naga-Hindu-mythology|title=Naga {{!}} Hindu mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their power and venom made them potentially dangerous to humans. However, they often took beneficial protagonist role in Hindu mythology, such as in [[Samudra manthan]] mythology, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], a [[Nagaraja|nāgarāja]] who abides on Shiva's neck, became the churning rope for churning of the Ocean of Milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/15105/why-was-vasuki-used-in-samudra-manthan-great-ocean-churning|title=Why was vasuki used in Samudra Manthan great ocean Churning|website=Hinduism Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eternal mortal enemies are the [[Garuda]]s, the legendary semidivine birdlike-deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garuda|title=Garuda {{!}} Hindu mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Vishnu]] is originally portrayed in the form sheltered by [[Shesha|Śeṣanāga]] or reclining on Śeṣa, but the iconography has been extended to other deities as well. The serpent is a common feature in [[Ganesha]] iconography and appears in many forms: around the neck,&lt;ref&gt;For the story of wrapping {{IAST|Vāsuki}} around the neck and {{IAST|Śeṣa}} around the belly and for the name in his sahasranama as {{IAST|Sarpagraiveyakāṅgādaḥ}} ("Who has a serpent around his neck"), which refers to this standard iconographic element, see: Krishan, Yuvraj (1999), Gaņeśa: Unravelling An Enigma, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|81-208-1413-4}}, pp=51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; use as a [[Upanayana|sacred thread]] (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|yajñyopavīta}}'')&lt;ref&gt;For text of a stone inscription dated 1470 identifying Ganesha's sacred thread as the serpent {{IAST|Śeṣa}}, see: Martin-Dubost, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of snake images in Ganesha iconography, see: Martin-Dubost, Paul (1997). Gaņeśa: The Enchanter of the Three Worlds. Mumbai: Project for Indian Cultural Studies. {{ISBN|81-900184-3-4}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva is often shown garlanded with a snake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin|authorlink=|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-43878-0}}; p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Maehle (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;297) states that "Patanjali is thought to be a manifestation of the serpent of eternity".

[[File:2006 0922 wat phrathat doi suthep buddha mucalinda.JPG|thumb|[[Mucalinda]] sheltering [[Gautama Buddha]] at [[Wat Phra That Doi Suthep]] in [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand]]
As in Hinduism, the Buddhist nāga generally has the form of a great cobra, usually with a single head but sometimes with many. At least some of the nāgas are capable of using magic powers to transform themselves into a human semblance. The nāga is sometimes portrayed as a human being with a snake or dragon extending over his head.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Nagas and Draconic Prototypes" in: Ingersoll, Ernest, et al., (2013). ''The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0&lt;/ref&gt; One nāga, in human form, attempted to become a monk; and when telling it that such ordination was impossible, the Buddha told it how to ensure that it would be reborn a human, and so able to become a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brahmavamso|first=Ajahn|title=VINAYA The Ordination Ceremony of a Monk|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut020.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Devadatta" chapter of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', the daughter of the dragon king, an eight year old [[longnü]] ({{IAST|nāga}}), after listening to [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] preach the Lotus Sutra, transforms into a male Bodhisattva and immediately reaches full enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Nancy (1981).

Nagas are believed to both live on [[Mount Meru]], among the other minor deities, and in various parts of the human-inhabited earth. Some of them are water-dwellers, living in streams or the ocean; others are earth-dwellers, living in underground caverns.

The nāgas are the followers of {{IAST|[[Virūpākṣa]]}} (Pāli: Virūpakkha), one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] who guards the western direction. They act as a guard upon Mount Sumeru, protecting the [[deva (Buddhism)|dēvas]] of [[Trāyastriṃśa]] from attack by the [[Asura (Buddhism)|asūras]].

Among the notable nāgas of Buddhist tradition is [[Mucalinda]], [[Nagaraja|Nāgarāja]] and protector of the Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra (I, 3), shortly after his enlightenment, the Buddha is meditating in a forest when a great storm arises, but graciously, King Mucalinda gives shelter to the Buddha from the storm by covering the Buddha's head with his seven snake heads.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;P. 72 ''How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings'' By Richard Francis Gombrich&lt;/ref&gt; Then the king takes the form of a young [[Brahmin]] and renders the Buddha homage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It is noteworthy that the two chief disciples of the Buddha, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Moggallāna]] are both referred to as ''Mahānāga'' or "Great Nāga".&lt;ref&gt;P. 74 ''How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings'' By Richard Francis Gombrich&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most important figures in Buddhist history symbolize nagas in their names such as [[Dignāga]], [[Nagasena|Nāgāsēna]], and, although other etymons are assigned to his name, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].

In the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] and [[Mahasiddha|Mahāsiddha]] traditions,{{sfn|Béer|1999|p=71}} nagas in their half-human form are depicted holding a naga-jewel, [[kumbha]]s of [[amrita]], or a [[terma (religion)|terma]] that had been elementally encoded by adepts.

According to tradition, Prajñapāramita sutras had been given by the Buddha to a great Naga who guarded them in the sea, and were conferred upon Nāgārjuna later.&lt;ref name="Donaldson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E.

==Other traditions==
{{see also|Phaya Naga}}
In [[Thailand]] and [[Java (island)|Java]], the nāga is a wealthy [[underworld]] deity. For [[Malaysia|Malay]] sailors, nāgas are a type of dragon with many heads. In [[Laos]] they are beaked water serpents.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Cambodia===
[[File:NagaPhnomPenh.jpg|thumb|upright|Cambodian seven-headed naga at the Royal Palace in [[Phnom Penh]]]]
The seven-headed nagas often depicted as guardian statues, carved as balustrades on causeways leading to main Cambodian temples, such as those found in [[Angkor Wat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=mI0vKhZXJqwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=naga+in+angkor+wat+cambodia&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit8Yf56vraAhVL6Y8KHc7qCRwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naga%20in%20angkor%20wat%20cambodia&amp;f=false|title=The Mythical Creatures Bible: The Definitive Guide to Legendary Beings|last=Rosen|first=Brenda|date=2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=9781402765360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently they represent the seven races within naga society, which has a mythological, or symbolic, association with "the seven colors of the rainbow". Furthermore, Cambodian naga possess numerological symbolism in the number of their heads. Odd-headed naga symbolise the Male Energy, Infinity, Timelessness, and Immortality. This is because, numerologically, all odd numbers come from One (1). Even-headed naga are said to be "Female, representing Physicality, Mortality, Temporality, and the Earth."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Indonesia===
[[File:Yogyakarta Indonesia Kraton-the-Sultans-Palace-03.jpg|thumb|left|Crowned golden Naga woodcarving at [[Keraton]] [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]]]]
In [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Bali#Culture|Balinese culture]], [[Indonesia]], a naga is depicted as a crowned, giant, magical serpent, sometimes winged. It is similarly derived from the [[Shiva]]-Hinduism tradition, merged with Javanese [[animism]]. Naga in Indonesia mainly derived and influenced by Indic tradition, combined with the native animism tradition of sacred serpents. In Sanskrit the term ''naga'' literally means snake, but in Java it normally refer to serpent deity, associated with water and fertility. In [[Borobudur]], the nagas are depicted in their human form, but elsewhere they are depicted in animal shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=naga+java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn16O16fraAhVJpo8KHajpCBQ4ChDoAQgqMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naga%20java&amp;f=false|title=Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas|last=Miksic|first=John|date=2012-11-13|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462909100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early depictions of circa-9th-century Central Java closely resembled Indic Naga which was based on [[cobra]] imagery. During this period, naga serpents were depicted as giant cobras supporting the waterspout of [[yoni]]-[[lingam]]. The examples of naga sculpture can be found in several Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candis]], including [[Prambanan]], [[Sambisari]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], and [[Jawi temple|Jawi]]. In East Java, the [[Penataran]] temple complex contain a ''Candi Naga'', an unusual naga temple with its Hindu-Javanese [[caryatids]] holding corpulent nagas aloft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=candi+naga+panataran&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjum27PraAhVLqo8KHY-7CVUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=candi%20naga%20panataran&amp;f=false|title=Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java|last=Kinney|first=Ann R.|last2=Klokke|first2=Marijke J.|last3=Kieven|first3=Lydia|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824827793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Crowned Naga flanked the stairs entrance of [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta|Pura Jagatkarta]]]]
The later depiction since the 15th century, however, was slightly influenced by Chinese dragon imagery—although unlike its Chinese counterparts, Javanese and Balinese nagas do not have legs. Naga as the lesser deity of earth and water is prevalent in the [[Majapahit|Hindu period]] of Indonesia, before the introduction of Islam.

In [[Bali]]nese tradition, nagas are often depicted battling [[Garuda]]. Intricately carved naga are found as stairs railings in bridges or stairs, such as those found in [[Balinese temple]]s, [[Ubud]] monkey forest, and [[Taman Sari (Yogyakarta)|Taman Sari]] in Yogyakarta.

In a [[wayang]] theater story, a snake (naga) god named Sanghyang Anantaboga or [[Antaboga]] is a guardian deity in the bowels of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Rodemeier: ''Lego-lego Platz und naga-Darstellung. Jenseitige Kräfte im Zentrum einer Quellenstudie über die ostindonesische Insel Alor''.

Diederichs, Düsseldorf 1981, {{ISBN|3-424-00693-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naga symbolize the nether realm of earth or underworld.

=== Laos ===
Naga are believed to live in the [[Laos|Laotian]] stretch of the [[Mekong]] or its estuaries. Lao mythology maintains that the naga are the protectors of [[Vientiane]], and by extension, the Lao state. The naga association was most clearly articulated during and immediately after the reign of [[Anouvong]]. An important poem from this period ''San Leupphasun'' ({{lang-lo|ສານລຶພສູນ}}) discusses relations between Laos and Thailand in a veiled manner, using the naga and the [[garuda]] to represent the Lao and the Thai, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ngaosīvat |first= Mayurī |author2=Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn |title= Paths to conflagration : fifty years of diplomacy and warfare in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, 1778-1828 |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100616420 |series= Studies on Southeast Asia |volume=24 |year= 1998 |publisher= Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University | location= Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn= 0-87727-723-0 |oclc= 38909607 |page= 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naga is incorporated extensively into Lao iconography, and features prominently in Lao culture throughout the length of the country, not only in Vientiane.

=== Malaysia ===
{{see|Lake Chini}}
In Malay and Orang Asli traditions, the lake Chini, located in [[Pahang]] is home to a naga called Sri Gumum. Depending on legend versions, her predecessor Sri Pahang or her son left the lake and later fought a naga called Sri Kemboja. Kemboja is the Malay name for Cambodia. Like the naga legends there, there are stories about an ancient empire in lake Chini, although the stories are not linked to the naga legends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nici.ru.nl/~peterh/srigumum/doc/stories.html Legends] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202720/http://www.nici.ru.nl/~peterh/srigumum/doc/stories.html |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeymalaysia.com/ML_chini.htm|title=Journey Malaysia » Tasik Chini|work=journeymalaysia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peasant foods''' are dishes specific to a particular culture, made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients, and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable. They often form a significant part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] of people who live in [[poverty]], or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country.

Peasant foods have been described as being the diet of [[peasant]]s, that is, [[tenant farmer|tenant]] or poorer farmers and their [[Farmworker|farm workers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coTiVJiWS00C&amp;pg=PA190 | title=Eating Right in the Renaissance | publisher=University of California Press | author=Albala, Ken | year=2002 | pages=190 | isbn=0520927281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension, of other cash-poor people. They may use ingredients, such as [[offal]] and less-tender cuts of meat, which are not as marketable as a [[cash crop]]. Characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals, in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth, with bread or other [[staple food]]. [[Sausage]]s are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.

Peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations. Such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The '''Porsche family''' is a prominent Austrian family of industrialists descending from the automotive pioneer [[Ferdinand Porsche]]. Its members have full ownership of the [[Porsche SE]] automobile company and majority voting rights over [[Volkswagen AG]], the biggest automaker in the world.

Ferdinand Porsche was born to a German-speaking family of [[Maffersdorf]], [[Bohemia]], son of Anton Porsche (1845-1908)  and Anna Ehrlich. The [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] surname ''Porsche'' can be traced to the 18th century in the area of Reichenberg (now [[Liberec]]), Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;baptism of Joannes Josephus (Wenzel) Porsche on 16 July 1777 in Neuharzdorf,  Reichenberg parish, son of 
Antonius Porsche  ''Tibialifex'' (stocking-maker)  and of  M. Elisabeth.

&lt;/ref&gt; The surname originates with the German word ''[[:wikt:Bursche|Bursche]]'' ("boy, young man, apprentice, farmhand") and is on record in northern Bohemia in various spellings (''Porsch, Borsche, Borsch, Bursche, Bursch, Pursch, Pursche'', etc.) from the early 17th century.

He is the author of three hundred ''[[sainete]]s'', little farcical sketches of city life, written to be played between the acts of a longer play. He published a selection in ten volumes (Madrid, 1786–1791). The best of his pieces, such as ''Las Tertulias de Madrid'', are specimens of satiric observation.

'''Rayed Mohammed Abdullah Ali''' (born 1978) is a [[Saudi Arabian]] student pilot, notable for having been [[deportation|deported]] from New Zealand in 2006 after it was realised that he had lived and trained in the USA with [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijacking pilots in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==Time in New Zealand==
Ali entered New Zealand in February 2006 on a [[student visa]], saying his dream was to become a commercial airline pilot and that he needed an English language qualification to assist. He then moved to [[Auckland]] to learn English and then moved to [[Palmerston North]] to fly at the [[Manawatu Aero Club]]. He told the Palmerston North flight school that he had obtained his [[Private Pilot License|private pilot's certificate]] in the [[United States]] and spent several years there before returning to [[Saudi Arabia]] to work in his father's textile business. He wanted to pass the [[International English Language Testing System]] (IELTS) exam so he could return home to train for his commercial pilot's licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/10/world/main1699090.shtml| title=Man With 9/11 Attacker Ties Deported| publisher=CBS News| date=June 9, 2006| accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2006, [[New Zealand Police|New Zealand authorities]] raided Ali's Palmerston North home, and on May 30 he was deported back to Saudi Arabia under escort. On June 10, 2006 the New Zealand government released a statement saying that Ali was deported because he "posed a threat to national security" and confirmed that he had lived and trained in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], USA with fellow Saudi [[Hani Hanjour]] in the months leading up to the September 11, 2001 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/archive/archive?ArchiveId=23494l| title= New Zealand deports 9/11 suspect| publisher=Aljazeera|date=June 12, 2006| accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 72==
It was only the second time that section 72 of the New Zealand Immigration Act has been used to deport someone. Its use requires the consent of the Governor-General, and there is no right of appeal. It was used for the deportation of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy [[Anvar Kadyrov]], a former [[KGB]] operative who was apprehended by New Zealand authorities in 1991 while attempting to obtain a New Zealand passport using a copy of a birth certificate of a deceased. Section 72 provides that where the Immigration Minister certifies that the continued presence in New Zealand of a person constitutes a threat to national security, the Governor-General may, by order in council, order that person's deportation.

[[New Zealand Police]] seized Ali's flight logbook from the flight school, where he had flown several times in a [[Cessna]] aircraft accompanied by the flight school instructors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Immigration authorities also stated that Ali used a variation of his name when entering the country. In 2004, the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' reported him as Rayed Mohammed Abdullah. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Rayed Ali's Connections==
New Zealand Immigration Minister [[David Cunliffe]] said that Ali "was directly associated with persons responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001" He also quoted excerpts from the [[United States|U.S.]] government's [[9/11 Commission Report]] on the attacks regarding Rayed Mohammed Abdullah Ali. The report says Ali lived and trained in Phoenix, Arizona with [[Hani Hanjour]], the Saudi Arabian believed to have piloted [[American Airlines Flight 77|Flight 77]] into [[the Pentagon]], on September 11, 2001. Abdullah was a leader at the [[Islamic Cultural Centre]] in Phoenix where, the [[FBI]] says, he "reportedly gave extremist speeches at the mosque". Immigration Minister David Cunliffe also said that he could not comment on what happened after Ali returned to Saudi Arabia nor could he comment on what information he had on him or where it came from. "We're satisfied he is the right man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10385963| title= Pilot with 9/11 links found in NZ| publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=June 10, 2006| accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9/11 Commission Report also says Abdullah attended the same Phoenix flight school as Hanjour and records show the pair used a flight simulator together on June 23, 2001.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Flight instructors at the [[Manawatu Aero Club]] say Ali wore a baseball cap, smart shirts and baggy trousers and favoured burgers and fries over [[halal]] food. One of the instructors, Captain Singh, a former [[Indian Air Force]] officer trained in [[intelligence]], who accompanied Ali on several flights in a [[Cessna 152]] aircraft, says Ali had a [[Yemen]]i passport and he was naturally suspicious at first. "At the time of September 11 he would have been in the US. I asked him some very direct questions about his US flying experience and found he was quite intelligent and a moderate person. He was not at all fundamentalist - he was against those people." "I found his standard to be very good", "He wanted to fly in Saudi Arabia or the [Arab] Emirates and was doing instrument training in the US before September 11 but said that since then everyone had treated him suspiciously. I'm 99 per cent sure he was genuine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://subs.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10386042| title= The Muslim who preferred burgers to halal food| publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=June 11, 2006| accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ali told Captain Singh he was born and raised in Saudi Arabia but travelled on a Yemeni passport because his father was from Yemen and Saudi Arabia had refused to give him citizenship. When he returned to Palmerston North, he told Captain Singh he had missed an application deadline and been unable to sit the [[IELTS]] exam in [[Auckland]]. He planned to re-apply in Palmerston North for the IELTS course, where it was cheaper to fly than in Auckland.

==The Tip Off==
On July 13, 2006, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' newspaper reported that New Zealand's security agencies discovered the identity of Rayed Mohammad Abdullah Ali after a tip off from [[Ardmore Flying School]], which is approximately 20 kilometres south of [[Auckland City]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The New Zealand Herald reported: "A month later, on April 12, Ali visited Ardmore Flying School and attempted to enrol in a flying course - an action which school general manager Craig Hunter believes may have been the beginning of the end of Ali's time in New Zealand. The school would not let Ali fly as he did not want to follow rules established to protect overseas student."{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} "He was not the least bit interested in complying with the rules, in terms of we would have made him pay a third of his total fee and he would have been granted an eight-month visa and we would have made him reapply for a student visa with the Ardmore Flying School as his training provider", the Herald reported.

Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] defended on her government's decision to deport Ali "When you have someone who clearly has been a close associate of a terrorist who took a plane into the Pentagon, it's clearly not useful to be providing them with pilot training in New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://subs.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10386042| title= New Zealand Deports Roommate of 9/11 Hijacker| publisher=The Washington Post|date=June 13, 2006| accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10885">[[File:Edmund Burke by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|alt=|thumb|Edmund Burke praised Christianity's ability to strengthen British society.]]
The '''religious thought of Edmund Burke''' includes published works by [[Edmund Burke]] and commentary on the same. Burke's religious thought was grounded in his belief that [[religion]] is the foundation of [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1964), 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  He sharply criticized [[deism]] and [[atheism]], and emphasized [[Christianity]] as a vehicle of [[social progress]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Harris, “Burke and Religion,” in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in [[Ireland]] to a [[Protestant]] father and [[Catholic]] mother, Burke vigorously defended the [[Church of England]] but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns.&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  He linked the conservation of a [[state religion]] with the preservation of citizens’ constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity’s benefits not only to the believer’s soul but also to political arrangements.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;Harris, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early views ==

Edmund Burke’s early essays “Religion of No Efficacy Considered as a State Engine” and “Religion” criticize contemporary efforts to reduce religion to a social and political instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Religion of No efficacy considered as a State Engine” in H.V.F. Somerset ed., ''A Note-book of Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 1957), 67&lt;/ref&gt;  “The Principle of Religion,” Burke wrote, “is that God attends to our actions to reward and punish them.” &lt;ref&gt;''A Note-book'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religion then, according to Burke, is ultimately something mysterious.&lt;ref&gt;'A Note-book'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It cannot exist without a personal God who places responsibilities on his creation.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Religion” in 'A Note-book'', 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke claimed that, “Moral Duties are included in Religion, and enforced by it.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Religion”&lt;/ref&gt; Burke’s identification of religion as the source of morality is a reoccurring theme throughout his work.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social benefits of Christianity compared with deism ==

Ian Harris has observed that Burke “emphasized the social benefits of Christianity, rather than its truth.” &lt;ref&gt;Harris, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke considered Christianity the source of civilization and appealed to the Christian tradition for both eternal salvation and human welfare in this life.&lt;ref name="Harris_a"&gt;Harris, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Burke “presumed the truth of Christianity,” he did not try to explain its central doctrines.&lt;ref name="Harris_b"&gt;Harris, 94&lt;/ref&gt;  This was consistent with Burke’s overall approach to religion, which was essentially political and philosophical rather than theological.&lt;ref name="Harris_a" /&gt;

Burke’s view that religion is the source of morality led him to view its absence as a perilous possibility.&lt;ref name="Reflections_a"&gt;''Reflections'', 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  His first published book, ''A Vindication of Natural Society'', satirizes the deism of his contemporary [[Viscount Bolingbroke]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “A Vindication of Natural Society,” in Isaac Kramnick ed, ''The Portable Edmund Burke'' (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing a distinction between revealed religions (those that believe in divinely inspired scripture) and natural religion or deism, Burke’s pseudo-Bolingbroke argues that revealed religion and civil society are similarly peppered with evils. If the remedy to revealed religion is natural religion, than the solution to civil society is natural society.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; By connecting natural religion with a primitive state of nature, Burke suggests the anti-social and degenerating implications of deism.&lt;ref name="Harris_d"&gt;Harris, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke considered religion and morality “sublime principles” and called for “religious establishments...that many continually revive and support them.” &lt;ref name="Reflections_b"&gt;''Reflections'', 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, Burke envisioned Christianity as “contributing directly to the cohesion and improvement of society.” &lt;ref name="Harris_b" /&gt;  Burke argued that “ the consecration of the state by a state religious establishment” was necessary to secure the freedom of Englishmen.&lt;ref name="Reflections"&gt;''Reflections'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only a state sanctioned religion, according to Burke, could effectively instill citizens with a sense of awe and responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref name="Reflections" /&gt;  A religion connected with the state was essential to making people realize that “they are to account for their conduct...to the one great Master, Author and Founder of society.” &lt;ref name="Reflections" /&gt;

== Pluralism and toleration ==

Although Burke was a forceful defender of the Church of England, his view that a revealed religion was indispensable to a society’s progress was not limited to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a speech before the House of Commons, Burke commended the “[[Hinduism|Hindoo]] (sic) Religion” for contributing to the “flourishing” of India.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harris, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, he lauded [[Islamic]] governments for having the “double sanction of law and religion.” &lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Speeches on the Impeachment of Warren Hastings,” in Isaac Kramnick ed, ''The Portable Edmund Burke'' (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ian Harris cautions that these praises do not imply that Burke “entertained relativism about religious truth.” Instead, Harris argues that these statements suggest Burke believed “that the religion which has become bound up with a society is the one that suits it." &lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke also spoke in support of Catholics and dissenters from the Church of England.&lt;ref name="EdmundBurke"&gt;Edmund Burke, “Speech on Relief of Protestant Dissenters” in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., ''The Philosophy of Edmund Burke'' (Ann Arbor: The University of Mitchigan Press, 1960), 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that because the church was “built up with the strong and stable matter of the gospel of liberty” it had nothing to fear from allowing other Christian groups to worship as they wished. Burke asserted that the Church of England’s “security of her own doctrines” made it possible to establish legal acceptance for Protestants and Catholics.&lt;ref name="EdmundBurke" /&gt; “Toleration,” Burke argued, “so far from being an attack upon Christianity, becomes the best and surest support that possibly can be given to it.” &lt;ref name="EdmundBurke" /&gt;  However, Burke fiercely defended the Church Establishment from attacks from within the Church of England. He publicly opposed the petition of several clergymen from the Church of England who asked to be relieved from subscription to the articles of the Act of Uniformity of 1662.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Speech on the Acts of Uniformity” in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., ''The Philosophy of Edmund Burke'' (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1960), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke advocated allowing English dissenters to practice Christianity the way they saw fit, but he briskly opposed efforts to subvert church authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, “Speech on the Acts of Uniformity” in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., The Philosophy of Edmund Burke (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1960), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and the French Revolution ==

Burke’s criticisms of the [[French Revolution]] reiterated his longstanding view that revealed religion is an integral part of a civilized society.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 100&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply condemned the confiscation of Church property by the revolutionaries and claimed that their nonreligious views were “against, not only our reason, but our instincts.” &lt;ref name="Reflections_b" /&gt; Burke predicted that if France rejected Catholicism, “some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition might take the place of it.”&lt;ref name="Reflections_b" /&gt;

Harris observes that Burke discerned clear religious features in the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Harris_c"&gt;Harris, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Revolution turned more radical and entered its international phrase, Burke thought of it “as no mere exercise in extending French rule, but instead as a crusade to destroy Christianity in Europe.” &lt;ref name="Harris_c" /&gt;  “In a drunken delirium,” Burke wrote, France risked “uncover[ing] our nakedness.” &lt;ref name="Reflections_a" /&gt;  The practice of a natural religion without revelation implied retrogression to “a savage and incoherent mode of life.” &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harris, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke’s mature thought on religion reveals a remarkable consistency throughout his long career.&lt;ref name="Harris_a" /&gt; For Burke, the French Revolution was a vivid example of the catastrophic consequences of deism, which he had ridiculed in ''A Vindication of Natural Society'' more than thirty years before.&lt;ref name="Harris_d" /&gt;  The inadequacy of natural religion for both personal salvation and civil society are enduring themes of Burke’s thought. Burke believed that only revealed religions, especially Christianity, offer the possibility of social and political improvement.&lt;ref name="Harris_a" /&gt; Linking morality and religion, Burke believed that the former could not exist without the latter. According to Burke, only institutional churches can effectively uphold these sublime principles and enable the fulfillment of man’s obligations both to his neighbors and to God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10471">The '''Splat Pack''' is a collection of [[independent filmmakers]] who, since 2002, have directed, written and produced numerous R-rated [[horror film]]s, notable for their [[Low-budget film|low budgets]] and extreme ultra-violence.&lt;ref name="the splat pack"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Splat Pack |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549299,00.html |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= October 22, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] of ''[[Total Film]]''.&lt;ref name="blood brothers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood Brothers  |first=Alan |last=Jones |authorlink=Alan Jones (film critic) |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956275.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been credited with bringing back ultra-violent movies, as well as moving away from [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rated movies and into the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] spectrum, all while operating with [[independent film|low budgets]].&lt;ref name="the splat pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrors"&gt;''New York Post''; October 22, 2006.

'''The Balfa Brothers''' (or '''Les Frères Balfa''') were an American [[cajun music]] ensemble. Its members were five brothers; [[Dewey Balfa|Dewey]] on fiddle, Will on fiddle, Rodney on guitar, harmonica, and vocals, Burkeman on [[triangle (music)|triangle]] and spoons, and Harry on [[Cajun accordion]].

==History==
The brothers first played together at family gatherings in the 1940s. Their father,  Charles Balfa,  a sharecropper,  had played fiddle and was a singer. Along with Hadley Fontenot, an accordionist and acquaintance of the family, they made their first recordings in 1951. The [[78rpm]] single was "La Valse de Bon Baurche" b/w "Le Two Step de Ville Platte", recorded at their house. After this Dewey went on to a successful solo career, recording on his own and with many ensembles.

Adopting the name Balfa Brothers in 1967, Dewey, Rodney, Will, Hadley Fontenot, and Dewey's daughter Nelda started touring [[folk festival]]s and European venues, playing Cajun music at a time in which its impact on American music had largely been forgotten. They made their first new recordings that year, and played at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].

They released several albums and appeared in the 1972 documentary ''[[Spend it All]]''. Over time they experimented with blending traditional Cajun music with more modern orchestral sounds. They continued together until 1979; that year Rodney and Will died in an [[auto accident]]. In 1980 Dewey's wife died of [[trichinosis]]. Following further lineup changes, the group continued under the name a few years later, and an ensemble continued to perform even after Dewey died in 1992.

The Balfa Brothers together with [[Marc Savoy]] appear playing "Parlez-nous à Boire" towards the end of the 1981 Walter Hill film [[Southern_Comfort_(1981_film)|Southern Comfort]]. Their song "La Danse de Mardi Gras" appears on the soundtracks for the 1992 film ''[[Passion Fish]]'' and the 2012 film ''[[Beasts of the Southern Wild]]''. It also appeared in a commercial for [[Carling Black Label]] Lager.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgkGjOfkvck&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Balfa Brothers along with the late  Cajun accordionist Danny Poulard are briefly in the movie "Garlic is as good as ten mothers," a 1980 documentary film about garlic directed by Les Blank.

She served as [[Home Secretary]] from 2010 to 2016. May was first elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] in [[UK general election, 1997|1997]]. Ideologically, she identifies herself as a [[one-nation conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-sets-out-one-nation-conservative-pitch-for-leadership |title=Theresa May sets out ‘one-nation Conservative’ pitch for leadership|first=Ben|last=Quinn|date=30 June 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May grew up in [[Oxfordshire]] and attended [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]]. From 1977 until 1983, she worked for the [[Bank of England]], and from 1985 until 1997 at the [[Association for Payment Clearing Services]], also serving as a councillor for Durnsford in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1992 and 1994, she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. From 1999 to 2010, May held a number of roles in the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinets]] of [[William Hague]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Howard]], and [[David Cameron]], including [[Shadow Secretary of State for Transport|Shadow Transport Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary]]. She was also [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] from 2002 to 2003.

After the [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|formation]] of a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], May was appointed [[Home Secretary]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], giving up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], she went on to become the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During her tenure she pursued reform of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], implemented a harder line on drugs policy including the banning of [[khat]], oversaw the introduction of elected [[Police and Crime Commissioners]], the deportation of [[Abu Qatada]], the creation of the [[National Crime Agency]] and brought in [[Home Office hostile environment policy|additional restrictions on immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |last=Rentoul |first=John |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Boring and competent Theresa May is what the nation needs after shock Brexit vote |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=11 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712173442/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |archivedate=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Cameron's resignation, May won a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|leadership election]] in July 2016, becoming the second female Prime Minister, following [[Margaret Thatcher]]. As Prime Minister, May began the process of [[Brexit|withdrawing the UK from the European Union]], triggering [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] in March 2017 then, the following month, announcing a [[snap election|snap]] [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|general election]] in June, with the aim of strengthening her hand in Brexit negotiations.&lt;ref name="Crace 2018-07-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/brexit-secretary-david-davis-resigns|title=Political crises don't come much bigger than Brexit|last=Crace |first=John|date=9 July 2018|work=[[GQ]]|accessdate=10 July 2018|authorlink=John Crace (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |title=General election 2017: Why did Theresa May call an election? |date=9 June 2017 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=4 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905062304/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |archivedate=5 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a [[hung parliament]], in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, despite the party winning their highest vote share [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|since 1983]], prompting her to broker a [[confidence and supply]] [[Conservative–DUP agreement|deal]] with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) to support a [[minority government]]. May is currently orchestrating the [[Brexit negotiations]] with the [[European Union]], adhering to the [[Chequers Agreement]], agreed in 2018.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] May stood unsuccessfully for the safe Labour seat of [[North West Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Durham]], coming second to incumbent MP [[Hilary Armstrong]] by 12,747 votes (27.6%) to 26,734 (57.8%), with future Liberal Democrat leader [[Tim Farron]] coming third. May then stood at the [[Barking by-election, 1994|1994 Barking by-election]], which was prompted by the death of Labour MP [[Jo Richardson]]. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945 and Labour candidate [[Margaret Hodge]] was expected to win easily, which she did, with 13,704 votes (72.1%). May came a distant third with 1,976 votes (10.4%). Ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], May was selected as the Conservative candidate for [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]], a new seat which was created from parts of the seats of [[Windsor and Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor and Maidenhead]] and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]]. She was elected with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early political career==
Having entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], May became a member of [[William Hague]]'s front-bench [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]] the new Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.

May was appointed the first female [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: "You know what people call us? The [[Nasty Party]]".&lt;ref name="Knowles2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Knowles|title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC&amp;pg=PA217|date=23 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920895-1|page=217|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225212002/https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC&amp;pg=PA217|archivedate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Childs2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Childs|title=Women and British Party Politics: Descriptive, Substantive and Symbolic Representation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yZ-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21|date=8 April 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-21157-9|pages=21–22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225212241/https://books.google.com/books?id=2yZ-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21|archivedate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, she was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and appointed Shadow [[Secretary of State for Transport]] after [[Michael Howard]]'s election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader in November that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3255441.stm |title=Howard unveils his top team |date=10 November 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311034146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3255441.stm |archivedate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004 she was moved to become [[Shadow Secretary of State for the Family]]. Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] she was also made Shadow [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]]. [[David Cameron]] appointed her [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons]] in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009, May was made Shadow [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]].

On 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,769{{spaced ndash}}60% of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt to unseat her in 2005 as one of the Liberal Democrats' leading "decapitation-strategy" targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 May 2005 |location=London |title=Defiant Kennedy takes 'decapitation' strategy into Tory heartland |last2=Sapsted |first1=Brendan |last1=Carlin |first2=David |accessdate=11 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706184240/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |archivedate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home Secretary==
{{Main article|Home Office under Theresa May}}
[[File:David Cameron's visit2.jpg|thumb|May with her then-leader [[David Cameron]], May 2010]]
On 12 May 2010, when May was appointed [[Home Secretary]] and Minister for Women and Equality by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] as part of his first Cabinet, she became the fourth woman to hold one of the British [[Great Offices of State]], after [[Margaret Thatcher]] ([[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]), [[Margaret Beckett]] ([[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]) and [[Jacqui Smith]] (Home Secretary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-flies-the-flag-for-women-in-government-1971727.html |title= Theresa May flies the flag for women in Government |work= The Independent |location= London |agency= Press Association |date= 12 May 2010 |accessdate= 16 September 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100515123510/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-flies-the-flag-for-women-in-government-1971727.html |archivedate= 15 May 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)|National Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-security/groups/national-security-council |title=National Security Council |publisher=Gov.uk |accessdate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107004019/https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-security/groups/national-security-council |archivedate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since [[James Chuter Ede]] who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951.

May's debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government's measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales. By way of a government bill which became the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]], she brought about the abolition of the Labour government's [[Identity Cards Act 2006|National Identity Card]] and database scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/identity-cards-to-be-scrapped-within-100-days-1984447.html |title=Identity cards to be scrapped within 100 days |date=27 May 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |agency=Press Association |accessdate=28 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530071415/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/identity-cards-to-be-scrapped-within-100-days-1984447.html |archivedate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8679072.stm |title=Identity cards set to be scrapped |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reformed the regulations on the retention of DNA samples for suspects and controls on the use of [[CCTV]] cameras. In May 2010, May announced the adjournment of the deportation to the United States of alleged computer hacker [[Gary McKinnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7131780.ece |title=Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon wins extradition reprieve |last=Sugden |first=Joanna |date=21 May 2010 |work=The Times |accessdate=28 October 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528062652/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7131780.ece |archivedate=28 May 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also suspended the registration scheme for carers of children and vulnerable people, with May saying that the measures were "draconian.

In August 2013, May supported the detention of [[David Miranda (politician)|David Miranda]], partner of ''Guardian'' journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]], under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], saying that critics of the Metropolitan Police action needed to "think about what they are condoning".&lt;ref name="miranda" /&gt; Lib Dem peer and former Director of Public Prosecutions [[Ken Macdonald]] accused May of an "ugly and unhelpful" attempt to implicate those who were concerned about the police action of "condoning terrorism".&lt;ref name="miranda"&gt;{{cite news |last= Watt |first= Nicholas |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/22/theresa-may-david-miranda-comments |title= Theresa May attacked for comments on critics of David Miranda's detention |work= The Guardian |location= London |date= 22 August 2013 |accessdate= 19 October 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020231937/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/22/theresa-may-david-miranda-comments |archivedate= 20 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court subsequently acknowledged there were "indirect implications for press freedom" but ruled the detention legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/david-miranda-detention-lawful-court-glenn-greenwald |title= David Miranda detention at Heathrow airport was lawful, high court rules |work= The Guardian |last1= Travis |first1= Alan |last2= Taylor |first2= Matthew |last3= Wintour |first3= Patrick |location= London |date= 19 February 2014 |accessdate= 31 July 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140731015603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/david-miranda-detention-lawful-court-glenn-greenwald |archivedate= 31 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

May also championed legislation popularly dubbed the [[Investigatory Powers Bill|Snooper's Charter]], requiring internet and mobile service providers to keep records of internet usage, voice calls, messages and email for up to a year in case police requested access to the records while investigating a crime.

Speaking at the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10453370.stm |title= Police must do more |date=29 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including "stop and search" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10619419.stm |title=Counter-terrorism measures to face government review |date=13 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8815000/8815378.stm |title= May announces scope of anti-terror law review |date= 13 July 2010 |work= BBC Democracy Live |accessdate= 14 July 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100717055653/http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8815000/8815378.stm |archivedate= 17 July 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, May announced a package of reforms to policing in England and Wales in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="Shakeup"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10757014 |title=Radical police shake-up announced |date=26 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726100849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10757014 |archivedate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Labour Government's central crime agency, [[Serious Organised Crime Agency|Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency)]], was to be replaced by a new [[National Crime Agency]]. In common with the Conservative Party 2010 general election manifesto's flagship proposal for a "[[Big Society]]" based on voluntary action, May also proposed increasing the role of civilian "reservists" for crime control. The reforms were rejected by the Opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="Shakeup" /&gt;

Following the actions of some members of [[Black Bloc]] in vandalising allegedly [[UK Uncut|tax-avoiding]] shops and businesses on the day of the March 2011 TUC march, the Home Secretary unveiled reforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/28/police-new-powers-cuts-protest-home-secretary?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Police may be given new powers after cuts protest, says home secretary |date=28 March 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104093739/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/28/police-new-powers-cuts-protest-home-secretary?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; curbing the right to protest, including giving police extra powers to remove masked individuals and to police social networking sites to prevent [[Public Order Act 1986|illegal protest]] without police consent or notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=15918 |title=Police may get social media crime powers |date=29 March 2011 |work=publicservice.co.uk Ltd |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407025057/http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=15918 |archivedate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, despite inquiries by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] ruling that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation, after discussions with [[Doreen Lawrence|Dame Doreen Lawrence]], May commissioned [[Mark Ellison]] to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-police-corruption-will-be-investigated-7811117.html|title=May defies Met to order inquiry after Independent campaign|author=Andrew Grice &amp; Paul Peachey|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was presented to Parliament by May on 6 March 2014. [[Bernard Hogan-Howe|Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], [[Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] said the report, which has prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was "devastating".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26485664|title=Hogan-Howe vows to restore trust in Met after new Lawrence row|publisher=BBC News|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than 10% under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |title=Crime is down by more than 10% under this government |publisher=Home Office |date=18 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172845/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |archivedate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, May delivered a speech to the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], in which she criticised aspects of the culture of the police force.&lt;ref name="May tells police – change or be changed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Nick |title=May tells police – change or be changed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214033013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |archivedate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, she said:

{{blockquote|When you remember the list of recent revelations about police misconduct, it is not enough to mouth platitudes about "a few bad apples". The problem might lie with a minority of officers, but it is still a significant problem, and a problem that needs to be addressed ... according to one survey carried out recently, only 42% of black people from a Caribbean background trust the police. That is simply not sustainable ... I will soon publish proposals to strengthen the protections available to whistleblowers in the police. I am creating a new criminal offence of police corruption. And I am determined that the use of stop and search must come down, become more targeted and lead to more arrests.&lt;ref name="2014 Police Federation speech"&gt;{{cite web|last1=May|first1=Theresa|title=The police must change and so must the Federation|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-police-federation-2014-speech|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818081359/https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-police-federation-2014-speech|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|student demonstrations]] in central London against increases to higher-education [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "under growing political pressure" due to her handling of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |title=Royal car attack: How did the police get it so wrong |date=10 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=10 December 2010 |first=James |last=Kirkup |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210215059/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |archivedate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests%3A_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730011732/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests:_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |dead-url=yes |archivedate=30 July 2012 |title=Royal car is attacked by protesters |date=9 December 2010 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been "resisted until now by senior police officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Porter |title=Police could use water cannon to disperse rioters, Theresa May says |date=12 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420083705/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |archivedate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected their use following the [[2011 England riots|widespread rioting in summer 2011]] and said: "the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities." May said: "I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order."&lt;ref name=patrol-streets&gt;{{cite news |title= London riots: Police patrol streets after violence |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14435251 |publisher= BBC News |date= 7 August 2011 |accessdate= 9 August 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110809203535/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14435251 |archivedate= 9 August 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." May added that "what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitehead |first=Tom |date=14 August 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |title=UK riots: Juveniles could be named and shamed, says Theresa May |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224855/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |archivedate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-social behaviour====
In July 2010, May proposed to review the previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government's [[anti-social behaviour]] legislation signalling the abolition of the "[[Asbo|Anti-Social Behaviour Order]]" (ASBO). She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to "fast-track" criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy "must be turned on its head", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |title=Time to 'move beyond ASBOS' says Home Secretary May |date=28 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728185910/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |archivedate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |title=Home Secretary signals the end of Asbos |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731090347/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |archivedate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Labour Home Secretaries [[David Blunkett]] (who introduced ASBOs) and [[Alan Johnson]] expressed their disapproval of the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |title=Approach to anti-social behaviour "must be turned on its head" |date=28 July 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 July 2010 |first=Wesley |last=Johnson |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730123651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |archivedate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug policy====
[[File:Deakhat.jpg|thumb|[[Khat]] bundles]]
In July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant [[khat]], against the advice of the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence" it caused health problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 "Herbal stimulant khat to be banned"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711045838/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 |date=11 July 2013 }}. BBC News. 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the change in the classification May said: "The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html "May under fire for banning khat".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707042248/http://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html |date=7 July 2013 }} ''London Evening Standard''. 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with "acute psychotic episodes", "chronic liver disease" and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf ACMD Report on Khat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205044630/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf |date=5 February 2016 }}. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family migration====
In June 2012, Theresa May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-[[European Economic Area]] family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 11 Jun 2012 (pt 0002) |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020164414/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly introduced rules came into effect on 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouses or their children to live with them in the UK. This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. They also increased the current two-year probationary period for partners to 5 years. The rules also prevent any adult and elderly dependents from settling in the UK unless they can demonstrate that, as a result of age, [[illness]] or [[disability]], they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a relative in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grower|first=Melanie|title=Changes to Immigration Rules for family members – Commons Library Standard Note SN-06353|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06353|date=18 December 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105063524/http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06353|archivedate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Lords]] was concerned about the immigration issue and therefore addressed the PM in Parliament as to whether she had examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but it received no direct response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Mair|first = Lucy|title = Supreme court strikes down Home Office's back-door changes to immigration rules|url = https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/supreme-court-immigration-rules|accessdate = 16 March 2013|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 18 July 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130824180235/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/supreme-court-immigration-rules|archivedate = 24 August 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families.&lt;ref name="Liberty briefing"&gt;{{cite web |title = Liberty's briefing on the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules |url = http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy12/liberty-s-briefing-on-the-statement-of-changes-in-immigration-rules-june-201.pdf |first = Yusef |last = Salehi |first2 = Rachel |last2 = Robinson |date = June 2012 |accessdate = 6 January 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121110164239/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy12/liberty-s-briefing-on-the-statement-of-changes-in-immigration-rules-june-201.pdf |archivedate = 10 November 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]] on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile [[British citizen]]s from the UK.&lt;ref name="AAPG report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the inquiry into new family migration rules|url=http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/sites/default/files/APPG_family_migration_inquiry_report-Jun-2013.pdf|first=Ruth|last=Grove-White|date=June 2013|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020121731/http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/sites/default/files/APPG_family_migration_inquiry_report-Jun-2013.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deportation decisions====
[[File:Memorandum of Understanding on transnational crime (5937407114).jpg|thumb|May, David Cameron and [[Najib Razak]], 14 July 2011]]
At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, "because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat". In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was "genuine". The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |title= Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim |date= 4 October 2011 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 5 October 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled "myths and misconceptions" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary [[Kenneth Clarke]] subsequently called May's comments "laughable and childlike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |title=Clarke hits out at 'childish remarks' |date=6 October 2011 |work=Nottingham Post |accessdate=14 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201216/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |archivedate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|title=Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|archivedate=5 October 2011|date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, May was found in [[contempt of court]] by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of "totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour", being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html |title=Theresa May accused of unacceptable and regrettable behaviour by judge |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623052328/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html |archivedate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukimmigrationbarristers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukimmigrationbarristers.com/blog/home-secretary-theresa-may-found-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-over-uk-immigration-issue/ |title=Home Secretary, Theresa May, found guilty of contempt of court over UK Immigration issue |work=UK Immigration Barristers blog |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726003350/http://www.ukimmigrationbarristers.com/blog/home-secretary-theresa-may-found-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-over-uk-immigration-issue/ |archivedate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May responded to a Supreme Court decision in November 2013 to overturn her predecessor [[Jacqui Smith]]'s revocation of Iraqi-born terror suspect Al Jedda's British citizenship by ordering it to be revoked for a second time, making him the first person to be stripped twice of British citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-secretary-theresa-may-strips-man-of-uk-citizenship--for-the-second-time-8976216.html |title= Home Secretary Theresa May strips man of UK citizenship – for the second time |work= The Independent |location= London |date= 1 December 2013 |accessdate= 8 December 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131208024226/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-secretary-theresa-may-strips-man-of-uk-citizenship--for-the-second-time-8976216.html |archivedate= 8 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/12/02/home-secretary-strips-man-of-uk-citizenship-for-the-second-time/ |title= Home Secretary strips man of UK citizenship – for the second time |work= The Bureau of Investigative Journalism |date= 2 December 2013 |accessdate= 8 December 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131207193202/http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/12/02/home-secretary-strips-man-of-uk-citizenship-for-the-second-time/ |archivedate= 7 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25190305 |title= Terror suspect Hilal Al-Jedda stripped of UK citizenship |publisher= BBC News |date= 2 December 2013 |accessdate= 8 December 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131209200409/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25190305 |archivedate= 9 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abu Qatada deportation====
[[File:Abu Qatada boards plane.jpg|thumb|Abu Qatada's deportation to Jordan]]

May has frequently pointed to Qatada's deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that "he will not be returning to the UK", and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she "couldn't deport Abu Qatada" but that she "flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |title=Abu Qatada will not be allowed back in UK, says Theresa May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717201355/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |archivedate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rentoul |first1=John |title=Boring and competent Theresa May is what the nation needs after the shock of the Brexit vote |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701191546/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qatada deportation also shaped May's views on the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Court of Human Rights]], saying that they had "moved the goalposts" and had a "crazy interpretation of our human rights laws", as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

===Leadership election===
{{Further information|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016}}
On 30 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to replace [[David Cameron]], who resigned following the outcome of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]] in which 52% of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring "strong leadership" and a "positive vision" for the country's future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: "The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door... Brexit means Brexit". An opinion poll that day found 47% of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1719848/theresa-may-is-britons-favourite-for-pm-poll |title=Theresa May Is Britons' Favourite For PM – Poll |last=Carr |first=Harry |date=30 June 2016 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=2 July 2016 |quote=The other candidates lagged far behind, with Michael Gove on 9% |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702045052/http://news.sky.com/story/1719848/theresa-may-is-britons-favourite-for-pm-poll |archivedate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July, May attended her first [[Prime Minister's Questions]] since taking office, then afterwards made her first [[List of international prime ministerial trips made by Theresa May|overseas trip as prime minister]], visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger [[UK Invocation of Article 50|Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon]]—the process for withdrawing from the European Union—before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to "take a moment" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |title=Brexit: Theresa May says talks won't start in 2016 |publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720014459/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |archivedate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rowena |last=Mason |first2=Philip |last2=Oltermann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |title=Angela Merkel backs Theresa May's plan not to trigger Brexit this year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720232931/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |archivedate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main|Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election#Preferred Prime Minister polling}}
May had a high approval rating during her first week as Prime Minister. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] would make a good Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3762/Two-in-three-say-Labour-should-change-leader-before-next-General-Election.aspx |title=Two in three say Labour should change leader before next General Election |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 July 2016 |publisher=Ipsos MORI |accessdate=18 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920200435/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3762/Two-in-three-say-Labour-should-change-leader-before-next-General-Election.aspx |archivedate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''ComRes'' poll taken in September 2016 after her election suggested May was seen as substantially more "in touch with ordinary British people" than her predecessor David Cameron and a majority of voters saw her as "the right person to unite the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Theresa May hugely popular among voters, who see her as in touch with 'ordinary people', poll finds |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservatives-popularity-ratings-public-support-a7327726.html |work=The Independent |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318172717/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservatives-popularity-ratings-public-support-a7327726.html |archivedate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing her as a [[liberal conservatism|liberal Conservative]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' characterised May as a "non-ideological politician with a ruthless streak who gets on with the job", in doing so comparing her to German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name="Warrell"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parker |first1=George |last2=Warrell |first2=Helen |title=Theresa May: Britain's Angela Merkel? |date=25 July 2014 |work=Financial Times |location=London |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/896aaa54-12bf-11e4-93a5-00144feabdc0.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703044351/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/896aaa54-12bf-11e4-93a5-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in ''[[The Independent]]'', Rebecca Glover of the Policy Innovation Research Unit contrasted May to [[Boris Johnson]], claiming that she was "staunchly more conservative, more anti-immigration, and more isolationist" than he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-conservative-party-leader-shes-no-progressive-conservative-a7109121.html |title=Don't be misled by Theresa May – she's no progressive Conservative |last=Glover |first=Rebecca |date=1 July 2016 |work=The Independent |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316194446/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-conservative-party-leader-shes-no-progressive-conservative-a7109121.html |archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she became Prime Minister, May's first speech espoused the left, with a promise to combat the "burning injustice" in British society and to create a union "between all of our citizens" and promising to be an advocate for the "ordinary working-class family" and not for the affluent in the UK. "The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives ... When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we’ll prioritise not the wealthy but you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May appeals to centre ground but cabinet tilts to the right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |accessdate=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713235732/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |archivedate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May has described herself as a personal supporter of fox hunting with hounds, saying that foxes' numbers had to be controlled and that hunting them with dogs was the most humane way to do it. The Conservative manifesto for the 2017 election included a pledge to hold a parliamentary vote to repeal the [[Hunting Act 2004]], which prohibits a range of hunting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-fox-hunting-conservatives-tories-ban-bring-back-repeal-hunting-act-general-election-2017-a7737881.html|title=Theresa May says she supports fox hunting because other ways of killing foxes are 'cruel'|date=16 May 2017|website=independent.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008160704/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-fox-hunting-conservatives-tories-ban-bring-back-repeal-hunting-act-general-election-2017-a7737881.html|archivedate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked recording prior to the [[Brexit]] referendum, May said,
{{quote|I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.&lt;ref Name="Guardian26/10/2016"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit Exclusive: what Theresa May really thinks about Brexit shown in leaked recording] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026091230/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit |date=26 October 2016 }} ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

May also said Britain was more secure as part of the [[European Union|EU]] due to the European arrest warrant and Europe-wide information sharing among other factors.

May is known for a love of fashion, and in particular of distinctive shoes; she wore leopard-print shoes at her '[[Nasty Party]]' speech in 2002, as well as her final Cabinet meeting as Home Secretary in 2016. On ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2014 she chose a subscription to [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] as her luxury item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-is-proof-that-female-politicians-dont-have-to-be-afr/|title=Theresa May is proof that female politicians don’t have to be afraid of fashion|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714225920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-is-proof-that-female-politicians-dont-have-to-be-afr/|archivedate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she has been critical of the media focusing on her fashion instead of her achievements as a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8033607.stm |title=Theresa May: My Life as a female MP |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818221937/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8033607.stm |archivedate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism and awards==
Prior to and since her appointment to Government, May has actively supported a variety of campaigns on policy issues in her constituency and at the national level of politics. She has spoken at the [[Fawcett Society]] promoting the cross-party issue of gender equality. May was nominated as one of the Society's Inspiring Women of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=413 |title=Fawcett Society |publisher=Fawcett Society |accessdate=16 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822013355/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=413 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the Patron of [[Reading University]] Conservative Association, in Berkshire (the county of her Maidenhead constituency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruconservative.com/friends/ |publisher=Reading University Conservative Association |title=Friends |accessdate=30 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703185632/http://www.ruconservative.com/friends/ |archivedate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' already described her as Britain's second-most powerful woman after Queen [[Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb/features/power-list-100|title=Woman's Hour – The Power List 2013|publisher=BBC Radio 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215063524/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb/features/power-list-100|archivedate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, during an official trip to Saudi Arabia, May was appointed to the [[Order of King Abdulaziz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=PM meeting with King Salman of Saudi Arabia: 5 April 2017|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-king-salman-of-saudi-arabia-5-april-2017|website=[[gov.uk]]|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That September she was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' as the second most powerful woman in the world, behind [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/|title=The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920073036/https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/|archivedate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urvashi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: उर्वशी, lit. ''she who can control heart of others. ("Ur" means heart and "vash" means to control'') is an [[Apsara]] ([[nymph]]) in Hindu legend. [[Monier Monier-Williams]] proposes a different etymology in which the name means 'widely pervasive' and suggests that in its first appearances in Vedic texts it is a name for the dawn goddess. She was a celestial maiden in [[Indra]]'s court and was considered the most beautiful of all the Apsaras.

She is the mother of [[Rishyasringa]], the great saint of the [[Ramayana]] era of ancient India from [[Vibhandaka]], who later played crucial role in birth of [[Rama]] and was married to [[Shanta]], the elder sister of Rama.

She became the wife of king ''[[Pururavas]]'' (''{{IAST|Purūrávas}}'', from ''{{IAST|purū}}''+''{{IAST|rávas}}'' "crying much or loudly"), an ancient chief of the [[Lunar Dynasty|lunar race]].  [[Shatapatha Brahmana|ShBr]] 11.5.1, and treated in [[Kalidasa]]'s drama ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam]]''.

She is perennially youthful and infinitely charming but always elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Birth==
[[File:Nara Narayana Deogarh.jpg|230px|thumb|Narayana on the left and Nara on the right, [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]], ca. 5th century]]
There are many legends about the birth of Urvashi but the following one is most prevalent.

Once the revered sages [[Nara-narayana]] were meditating in the holy shrine of [[Badrinath Temple]] situated in the Himalayas. [[Indra]], the king of the Gods, did not want the sage to acquire divine powers through meditation and sent two [[apsara]]s to distract him. The sage struck his thigh and created a woman so beautiful that Indra’s apsaras were left matchless. This was Urvashi, named from ur, the Sanskrit word for thigh. After his meditation was complete the sage gifted Urvashi to Indra, and she occupied the pride of place in [[Indra]]’s court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1461">'''Zacharias Longuelune''' (1669—November 30, 1748) was a [[France|French]] architect and master builder who worked in the second half of his life for the royal court in [[Dresden]]. His design style was [[French Baroque and Classicism]].

Longuelune was born in [[Paris]]. After working in [[Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]] for [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and travelling to [[Italy]], he settled in Dresden in 1713 where he became Senior State Architect (''Oberlandbaumeister'') in 1731 for the Elector of Saxony, [[Augustus II the Strong]]. His works include the park at Grosssedlitz (1719–1732), the Riverside Palace and the water stairs at [[Pillnitz Castle]] (1720–1725) and part of the [[Japanisches Palais]] (from 1729 with court architect [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Löffler, ''Das Alte Dresden: Geschichte seiner Bauten'',  16th ed.

He died in [[Dresden]] in 1748.
