The '''A272''' is a road in southeast [[England]]. It follows an approximate east-west route from near [[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]], [[East Sussex]] to the city of [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]].

==Route==
The eastern end of the A272 starts at a junction with the [[A267 road|A267]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} north-west of the village of [[Cross In Hand]], [[East Sussex]]. It heads west, crossing the [[A26 road|A26]] and [[A22 road|A22]] north of [[Uckfield]], and continues through [[Newick]] before going over the border into [[West Sussex]] at a point east of [[Scaynes Hill]]. It then bypasses the town of [[Haywards Heath]] and continues west, crossing the main [[London]]-[[Brighton]] [[A23 road]] at [[Bolney]].

The route continues, crossing the [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24]] and passing through a number of villages and small towns in [[West Sussex]], such as [[Billingshurst]], [[Petworth]] and [[Midhurst]]. It then crosses the county boundary into [[Hampshire]] and reaches [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], where it crosses the [[A3 road (Great Britain)|A3]] to the west of the town. The final section passes the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property of [[Hinton Ampner]] and rises high on to the [[Hampshire]] [[downland|downs]], passing [[Cheesefoot Head]], before descending to merge with the [[A31 road|A31]] at Chilcomb to the east of [[Winchester]]. 

In former years, the A272 continued north-west from [[Winchester]] to [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]], but this section has now been redesignated as the [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B3049]]. Today, after {{convert|1.3|mi}} it re-emerges from the A31 to run north to the Winnall Roundabout, Junction 9 of the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]]. Here it merges with the [[A34 road (England)|A34]], passing east and north of [[Winchester]] (with limited access to the [[A33 road|A33]] northbound), before re-emerging near Littleton. It then runs NW along the Andover Road (formerly [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B3420]]), terminating at the [[A30 road|A30]], an overall length of {{convert|85|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=50.994311,0.212688&amp;daddr=51.0112793,-0.4332312+to:A272&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.118394,-1.42067&amp;spn=0.1209,0.308304&amp;sll=50.962752,-0.302124&amp;sspn=0.242613,0.616608&amp;geocode=FYccCgMd0D4DAA%3BFc9eCgMdsWP5_ymjGrlAYr91SDGmkjt4F3jroQ%3BFbRYDAMd_Ofq_w&amp;t=h&amp;mra=dvme&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=11&amp;via=1&amp;z=12 |title= Directions to A272|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north the B3420 continues across the [[River Test]] to [[Wherwell]] and [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].

==Features==
The A272's route is predominantly [[rural]], despite being only {{convert|40|mi}} from the centre of [[London]] at its nearest point. Most of the time it passes through countryside, villages and small towns, and the only built-up area of any size that it traverses is [[Haywards Heath]] and its surrounding villages. Also, it has virtually no [[dual carriageway]] sections (just three very short sections between [[Petworth]] and [[Midhurst]]), and therefore gives the driver an experience which is reminiscent of English country roads as they were 50 or more years ago.

While it has been said that the A272 follows part of the route that was taken by [[pilgrim]]s travelling between the [[cathedral]] cities of [[Winchester]] and [[Canterbury]] it is unlikely because, for most of its length, it passes through the low [[weald]] of [[Sussex]]. Prior to the development of modern roads, this was difficult for travellers, because of the extensive forest and tracts of low-lying marshy ground. The more likely route was the [[Pilgrims' Way]], which followed the [[chalk]] [[escarpment]] of the [[North Downs]].

==In popular culture==
The road is the subject of a book by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author [[Pieter Boogaart]]: ''A272 - An Ode to a Road'' (Pallas Athene, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Boogaart|first=P|title=A272: An Ode to a Road|publisher=Pallas Athene|date=2000|ISBN=1-873429-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A477'''  is a major road in [[Pembrokeshire|South Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] connecting [[St Clears]] and [[Johnston, Pembrokeshire|Johnston]]. Its route includes the [[Cleddau Bridge]], a [[toll bridge]] linking [[Pembroke Dock]] and [[Neyland]].

From the [[A40 road (Great Britain)|A40]] in St Clears, the A477 is a trunk road with primary status as far as the Waterloo roundabout in Pembroke Dock, on the southeast side of the [[Milford Haven Waterway]]. Responsibility for the management and maintenance of this section lies with the [[South Wales Trunk Road Agent]] on behalf of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]. From there the responsibility for maintaining the A477 is held by [[Pembrokeshire County Council]].

==History==
[[File:A477Road 1923MOTMap.png|thumb|left|Original route of the A477 between Pembroke Dock and Red Roses(1923)]]
[[File:New A477 Red Roses By Pass - looking west-geograph-3928687-by-welshbabe.jpg|thumb|left|Red Roses bypass - looking west]]
A route from St Clears to Pembroke Dock was first surveyed by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1826, as part of a review of the route of the mail service from London to Ireland that at the time went via the docks at Milford Haven. A decision was taken in 1827 to move the mail port from Milford Haven to Hobbs Point in Pembroke Dock, and to pursue the access route from St Clears to Pembroke Dock. By 1830, a section of the road between the villages of [[Llanddowror]] and [[Red Roses]] had been completed.&lt;ref name="Ayres2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayres |first=George |date=2011 |title=History of the Mail Routes to Ireland Until 1850 |page=64-65 |isbn=9781446605042}}&lt;/ref&gt; A levy on mail passing through Milford was introduced by the Postage Act 1836, to be used to fund the new route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title = Postage Act 1836 | number = 6 Will 4 c.25 | language = English | date = {{date|1836-06-21|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full route was completed in 1839, running from St Clears via Llanddowror, Red Roses, [[Llanteg]], [[Begelly]] and [[Carew, Pembrokeshire|Carew]] to Pembroke Dock.&lt;ref name="Ayres2011" /&gt;

Road designations were first allocated by the [[Ministry of Transport]] in 1922 with the road between Red Roses and Pembroke Dock being designated the A477. The section between St Clears and Red Roses, which was originally part of the A40, was redesignated the A477 by the early 1930s.{{efn|The 1924-25 Ordnance Survey MoT map still shows the St.Clears-Red Roses section as part of the A40. By the 1932 Ordnance Survey Ten Mile map, it is part of the A477.}}

The 22-mile section of the road from its start at St Clears as far as Nash{{mdash}}which is a convenient distribution point for places on the south side of Milford Haven{{mdash}}was promoted to a [[Trunk road#United Kingdom|trunk road]] following an announcement by the (then) [[Secretary of State for Wales]], [[Cledwyn Hughes]], on 14 November 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wales (Trade and Industry) House of Commons debates |date=1966-11-14 |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1966-11-14a.40.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further {{convert|2+3/4|mi}} from Nash to Waterloo roundabout in Pembroke Dock were upgraded to trunk road in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=Trunk Roads |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-01-25/Writtens-7.html |date=25 January 1993 |speaker=Sir Wyn Roberts |column=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cleddau bridge1.jpg|thumb|The [[Cleddau Bridge]] became operational during 1975]]

The Cleddau Bridge is funded by tolls which are collected at Pembroke Dock from traffic in both directions. Pedestrians and cyclists are free of charge.

They are, since 1993, 35p for motorcycles, 75p for cars, £1.50 for heavy vehicles. Car drivers may also buy books of 20 or 50 bridge tickets which reduces the cost to 60p per crossing. The toll booths only accept cash or the pre-purchased tickets. Toll booths with barriers were introduced in September 2004 to reduce the number of vehicles driving through without paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A review was carried out in early 2016, when Pembrokeshire County Councillors voted that all toll charges would remain unchanged and would not be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-34143903|title=Pembrokeshire toll bridge to be reviewed after complaint|publisher=BBC News |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-36285073|title=Pembrokeshire's Cleddau Bridge tolls to stay the same|publisher=BBC News |date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the County Council and the Welsh Assembly Government agree to abolish tolls on the Cleddau Bridge from April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46046474&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A77 road''' is a major road in Scotland. It runs in a southwesternly direction from the city of [[Glasgow]], past the towns of [[Giffnock]], [[Newton Mearns]], [[Kilmarnock]], [[Prestwick]], [[Ayr]], [[Maybole]], [[Girvan]] and [[Stranraer]] to the town of [[Portpatrick]] on the [[Irish Sea]]. It passes through the [[council areas]] of Glasgow City, [[East Renfrewshire]], [[East Ayrshire]], [[South Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]].

It has full [[trunk road]] status from the terminus of the [[M77 motorway]] at [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] to the junction with the [[A75 road|A75]] in Stranraer.

The A77 is an important link from [[Glasgow]] to one of its two major airports, [[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport|Prestwick Airport]], and to the three main [[Transport in Scotland#Ferries|Northern Ireland ferry]] terminals at Stranraer, [[Cairnryan]], and [[Troon]]. As a result, the road is subject to a busy mixture of commuter, tourist and heavy goods vehicle traffic which has necessitated upgrades to many sections.

== History ==

[[Bypass (road)|Bypasses]] for Ayr and Kilmarnock were built in the 1970s, and the M77 motorway replaced the Glasgow to Newton Mearns section in two stages, in the mid-to-late 1990s, but [[M77 motorway#History|not without controversy]] as a section of the motorway was routed through [[Pollok Country Park]].

This still left the East Ayrshire stretch of the road which widely appeared in statistics as one of the most dangerous sections of road in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The majority of this section was an unsegregated, 4-lane single carriageway between Kilmarnock and Newton Mearns and the lanes were narrow compared to the standard of other major roads. At several points, it was common for traffic waiting to turn right to queue in the overtaking lane. The speed limit of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}} was widely ignored. Finally, the road narrowed to only two lanes near Newton Mearns, causing long queues.
The combined result was a number of fatal crashes. The [[Scottish Executive]] took the decision to replace the entire section up to the Kilmarnock bypass with an extension of the M77 after pressure and campaigning from [[West Sound (Ayrshire)|West Sound]] and [[West FM]].

Construction of the motorway was faster than usual, given the eagerness to replace the A77 after another fatal crash in June 2002 resulted in the death of Hugh Davidson, then Chief Inspector of [[Strathclyde Police]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollofhonour.org/national_roll/2002/NPORH_2002.htm|title=Police Roll of Honour 2002| publisher=Roll of Honour Research | date=29 May 2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the motorway was opened in April 2005. This completed a continuous dual carriageway road from Glasgow to Ayr.

In an effort to prevent a repeat of the fatalities on the southern section of the road, July 2005 saw the A77 become host to the largest automatic [[speed limit enforcement]] system in the whole of the UK. Based on the digital [[SPECS (speed camera)|SPECS]] system rather than the traditional fixed post [[GATSO]] film cameras, gantries with automatic numberplate recognition cameras are sited on the road at intervals of between {{convert|1|and|5|mi|km|0}} and measure the average speed of traffic. The enforced zone stretches from the Bogend Toll Junction ([[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Tarbolton]] junction) at the northern end on the dual carriageway section where the junctions are not [[grade separated]], down to just north of Lendalfoot; a distance of around {{convert|32|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/projects/a77-symington-and-bogend-toll-project|title=A77 Symington and Bogend Toll Project – Project Benefits|publisher=Transport Scotland|date=November 2010|accessdate=1 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035906/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/projects/a77-symington-and-bogend-toll-project|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 10 March 2008 a long term temporary {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} limit to Dutch House Roundabout was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/31/newsitem/35/newscategory/0/|title=SPECS CONTINUES TO REDUCE A77 CASUALTIES|last=|first=|date=30 October 2008|website=|publisher=A77 Safety Group|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the death in October 2006 of another police officer, Constable Kevin Lowe. Constable Lowe was on duty and en route at approximately {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to a call at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/Lowe.html|title=DETERMINATION IN RESPECT OF THE DEATH OF POLICE CONSTABLE KEVIN LOWE| publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk | date=12 November 2007 | accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speed limit is to remain in force until new grade separated junctions are opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2012/04/12/transport-scotland-invites-bids-for-a75-and-a77/|title=Transport Scotland invites bids for A75 and A77| publisher=Construction Enquirer | date=12 April 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been continued efforts to improve the road in the south. One such project, the Turnberry Climbing Lane which opened in 2005, has enhanced guaranteed overtaking opportunities on the single carriageway section. Another improvement opened in Autumn 2006, the upgraded Whitletts roundabout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/69 |title=IMPROVEMENTS AT WHITLETTS |publisher=A77 Safety Group |date=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209195408/http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/69 |archivedate=9 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[traffic lights]] and spiral lanes. Climbing lanes were added at Haggstone and Drummuckloch and a {{convert|0.8|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch was straightened north of nearby [[Glenapp Castle|Glenapp]] in autumn 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/31/newsitem/36/newscategory/0/|title=South west Scotland gets roads improvements Christmas present|last=|first=|date=December 2008|website=|publisher=A77 Safety Group|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a {{convert|1.8|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch was widened from Park End to [[Bennane Head|Bennane]].&lt;ref name="WPCleanerAuto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/news/A77-Parkend-Bennane-completion |title=Transport Minister views progress of A77 |publisher=Transport Scotland |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414130916/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/news/A77-Parkend-Bennane-completion |archivedate=14 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The A77 was formerly part of the [[Euroroute]] system, and comprised route E111.

==Proposed developments==

A [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] for [[Maybole]] is in planning stages but has not yet been funded (as at 2011).&lt;ref name="WPCleanerAuto1" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;

'''Adas Bank''' is a submerged [[bank (topography)|bank]] located off the west coast of [[India]], between [[Angria Bank]] (200&amp;nbsp;km to the north) and [[Cora Divh]] bank of the [[Laccadive Islands]] (90&amp;nbsp;km to the south).

==Geography==
The nearest coast is the Indian mainland close to [[Goa]], which is 180&amp;nbsp;km [[ENE]] of Adas Bank. It is not considered part of the [[Laccadive Islands]] anymore, but nevertheless one of the northernmost features of the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]]. The minimum depth of the bank is 70 meters.

[[File:Basalt used in wave braker beach The hague.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Armour of basalt blocks]]
In [[hydrology]] and [[geography]], '''armor''' is the association of surface [[pebble]]s, rocks or [[boulder]]s with [[stream bed]]s or [[beach]]es. Most commonly hydrological armor occurs naturally; however, a man-made form is usually called [[riprap]], when [[shoreline]]s or stream banks are fortified for [[erosion]] protection with large boulders or sizable manufactured concrete objects.  When armor is associated with [[beach]]es in the form of pebbles to medium-sized stones grading from two to 200 millimeters across, the resulting [[landform]] is often termed a ''[[shingle beach]]''.  Hydrological modeling indicates that stream armor typically persists in a [[flood stage]] environment.&lt;ref name="Wilcock"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcock |first=Peter R. |author2=DeTemple, Brendan T. |date = April 2005|title=Persistence of armor layers in gravel-bed streams |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=8 |bibcode=2005GeoRL..32.8402W |doi=10.1029/2004GL021772 |pages=L08402}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Hjulstroms Diagram  ==
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|250x250px|Hjulstroms Diagram ]]

Bed armor is most often transported through entrainment, and more specifically suspension and saltation. Both of these processes involve moving the sediment both near and around the bed of a river. When a sediment is entrained it is being moved downstream through the forces between the layers of water around it, and once it settles it begins to create a layer on the bed of the river. This layer of sediment changes the hydrology of the river around it, as once this layer on the bottom is formed it affects the hydraulics of the river. This layer of sediments on the bed of the river can act as barrier to the incoming flow, and depending on the size and distribution of the grains, can change the river. Understanding the [[Hjulström curve|Hjulstroms diagram]] is important, as it represents at what grain size and flow speed a particle is transported. The slope present at the top left of the graph is due to clay and silt [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]].

== Particle size ==
The distribution and size of the sediments can sometimes help indicate the type of river, and the general flow direction. The grain distribution of the bed armor is essential to understanding the armor, and its function that is dependent on the size of the armor. For example, if there is a large piece of sediment that sits on the bed armor layer of the river it can change the threshold for [[critical flow]]. The change in critical flow at the bottom of the stream or river can change the turbidity of the flow, and create different types of river systems depending on the range of impact the change in flow has. This effect can create a positive loop, with the critical flow disrupting smaller sediments downstream which repeat the process.

== Stream power ==
[[Stream power]] expresses the amount of energy that a river is exerting on its bed. The equation is primarily used to understand the force in terms of the water doing work on the bed. Bed armor is directly involved with this equations, when the force on the stream increases the water acting on the sediments can also increase. This can lead to change and movement within the stream in reference to the sediments on the bottom layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9002">'''Automatic label placement''', sometimes called '''text placement''' or '''name placement''', comprises the computer methods of placing labels automatically on a map or chart. This is related to the [[Labeling (map design)|typographic design of such labels]].

The typical features depicted on a geographic [[map]] are line features (e.g. roads), area features (countries, parcels, forests, lakes, etc.), and point features (villages, cities, etc.). In addition to depicting the map's features in a geographically accurate manner, it is of critical importance to place the names that identify these features, in a way that the reader knows instantly which name describes which feature.

Automatic text placement is one of the most difficult, complex, and time-consuming problems in mapmaking and [[Geographic information system|GIS (Geographic Information System)]]. Other kinds of computer-generated graphics – like [[chart]]s, [[graph of a function|graph]]s etc. – require good placement of labels as well, not to mention engineering drawings, and professional programs which produce these drawings and charts, like [[spreadsheets]] (e.g. [[Microsoft Excel]]) or computational software programs (e.g. [[Mathematica]]).

Naively placed labels overlap excessively, resulting in a map that is difficult or even impossible to read. Therefore, a GIS must allow a few possible placements of each label, and often also an option of resizing, rotating, or even removing (suppressing) the label. Then, it selects a set of placements that results in the least overlap, and has other desirable properties. For all but the most trivial setups, the problem is [[NP-hard]].

==Rule-based algorithms==
Rule-based algorithms try to emulate an experienced human cartographer. Over centuries, cartographers have developed the art of mapmaking and label placement. For example, an experienced cartographer repeats road names several times for long roads, instead of placing them once, or in the case of Ocean City depicted by a point very close to the shore, the cartographer would place the label "Ocean City" over the land to emphasize that it is a coastal town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slocum|first=Terry|title=Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-801006-4|pages=576|url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/0138010064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartographers work based on accepted conventions and rules and they place labels in order of importance. For example, New York City, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, or Tokyo must show up on country maps because they are high-priority labels. Once those are placed, the cartographer places the next most important class of labels, for example major roads, rivers, and other large cities. In every step they ensure that (1) the text is placed in a way that the reader easily associates it with the feature, and (2) the label does not overlap with those already placed on the map.

==Local optimization algorithms==
The simplest [[greedy algorithm]] places consecutive labels on the map in positions that result in minimal overlap of labels. Its results are not perfect even for very simple problems, but it is extremely fast.

Slightly more complex algorithms rely on local optimization to reach a local optimum of a placement evaluation function – in each iteration placement of a single label is moved to another position, and if it improves the result, the move is preserved. It performs reasonably well for maps that are not too densely labelled. Slightly more complex variations try moving 2 or more labels at the same time. The algorithm ends after reaching some local optimum.

A simple algorithm – [[simulated annealing]] – yields good results with relatively good performance. It works like local optimization, but it may keep a change even if it worsens the result. The chance of keeping such a change is &lt;math&gt;\exp \frac{-\Delta E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the evaluation function, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the ''temperature''. The temperature is gradually lowered according to the ''annealing schedule''. When the temperature is high, simulated annealing performs almost random changes to the label placement, being able to escape a [[local optimum]]. Later, when hopefully a very good local optimum has been found, it behaves in a manner similar to local optimization. The main challenges in developing a simulated annealing solution are choosing a good evaluation function and a good annealing schedule. Generally too fast cooling will degrade the solution, and too slow cooling will degrade the performance, but the schedule is usually quite a complex algorithm, with more than just one parameter.

Another class of direct search algorithms are the various [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, e.g. [[genetic algorithm]]s.

==Divide-and-conquer algorithms==
One simple optimization that is important on real maps is dividing a set of labels into smaller sets that can be solved independently. Two labels are ''rivals'' if they can overlap in one of the possible placements. [[transitive relation|Transitive]] closure of this relation divides the set of labels into possibly much smaller sets. On uniformly and densely labelled maps, usually the single set will contain the majority of labels, and on maps for which the labelling is not uniform it may bring very big performance benefits. For example, when labelling a map of the world, [[United States|America]] is labelled independently from [[Eurasia]] etc.

==2-satisfiability algorithms==
If a map labeling problem can be reduced to a situation in which each remaining label has only two potential positions in which it can be placed, then it may be solved efficiently by using an instance of [[2-satisfiability]] to find a placement avoiding any conflicting pairs of placements; several exact and approximate label placement algorithms for more complex types of problems are based on this principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Srinivas|last1=Doddi|first2=Madhav V.|last2=Marathe|first3=Andy|last3=Mirzaian|first4=Bernard M.

==Other algorithms==
Automatic label placement algorithms can use any of the algorithms for finding the [[maximum disjoint set]] from the set of potential labels. Other algorithms can also be used, like various graph solutions, [[integer programming]] etc.

'''Bamyan Province''' ({{lang-prs|ولایت بامیان}}) is one of the thirty-four [[provinces of Afghanistan]], located in the central highlands of the country. Its terrain is mountainous or semi-mountainous. The province is divided into six [[Districts of Afghanistan|districts]], with the town of [[Bamyan]] serving as its capital. The province has a population of about 455,000.&lt;ref name=cso/&gt; It is the largest province in the [[Hazarajat]] region of [[Afghanistan]], and is the cultural capital of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group that predominates in the area.

Its name can be translated as "The Place of Shining Light". In antiquity, central Afghanistan was strategically placed to thrive from the [[Silk Road]] caravans that criss-crossed the region, trading between the Roman Empire, China, [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Bamyan was a stopping-off point for many travellers. It was here that elements of Greek and Buddhist art were combined into a unique classical style known as [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] art.

The province has several famous historical sites, including the now-destroyed [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], around which are more than 3,000 caves, the [[Band-e Amir National Park]], Dara-i-Ajhdar, Gholghola and Zakhak ancient towns, the Feroz Bahar, Astopa, Klegan, Gaohargin, Kaferan and Cheldukhtaran.

=== Ancient ===
Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0002) Pre-Islamic Period], by Craig Baxter (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name="Dupree3"&gt;[[Nancy Hatch Dupree|Nancy H. Dupree]] (1973). ''An Historical Guide To Afghanistan'', Chapter 3 Sites in Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref name="JFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html|title=Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska|publisher=Webcitation.org|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=19 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes later migrated further south to India, west to what is now Iran, and towards Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F. (2001). ''The quest for the origins of Vedic culture: the Indo-Aryan migration debate''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513777-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The region as a whole was called [[Ariana]].&lt;ref name="JFS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, p3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;M. Witzel (2000), "The Home Of The Aryans", Festschrift J. Narten = Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft, Beihefte NF 19, Dettelbach: J.H. Röll, 283–338. Also published online, at [[Harvard University]] ([http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf LINK]). p. 48. "The Vīdẽvdaδ list obviously was composed or redacted by someone who regarded Afghanistan and the lands surrounding it as the home of all Indo-Iranians (airiia), that is of all (eastern) Iranians, with Airiianem Vaẽjah as their center."&lt;/ref&gt;

The people shared similar culture with other [[Indo-Iranians]]. The ancient religion of [[Kafiristan]] survived here until the 19th century. Another religion, [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0003) Achaemenid Rule, ca. 550-331 B.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html|title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation|date=15 February 1989|publisher=Gandhara.com.au|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html|archive-date=9 September 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm|title=''Afghanistan: Achaemenid dynasty rule'', Ancient Classical History|date=13 April 2012|publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234134/http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm|archivedate=2013-12-30|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. 

By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of King [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Dupree, [http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php#Top An Historical Guide to Kabul]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185437/http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php#Top|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] seized the area but left it to [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] to rule. The area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] was given to the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]] who introduced Buddhism. The Mauryas introduced were planning to capture more territory in Central Asia, until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces. [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] is said to have reached a peace treaty with Mauryan emperor Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka the Great]]]]

Afghanistan's significant ancient tangible and intangible [[Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan|Buddhist heritage]] is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds, including religious and artistic remnants. Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as [[Balkh]] even during the life of the [[Buddha]] (563 BCE to 483 BCE), as recorded by [[Xuanzang|Husang Tsang]]. It became the site of an early Buddhist monastery. Many statues of Buddha were carved into the sides of cliffs facing Bamyan city. The two most prominent of these statues were standing Buddhas, now known as the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], measuring 55 and 37 meters high respectively, that were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world. They were probably erected in the 4th or 5th century A.D. They were cultural landmarks for many years and are listed among [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Sites]]. In March 2001 the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]] decreed that the statues were idolatrous and ordered them to be demolished with anti-aircraft artillery and explosives.[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|upright|thumb|The smaller [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha of Bamiyan]]. [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhism]] was widespread in the region before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].]]

By the 7th century, when the Arabs first arrived, it was under the control of the [[Kabul Shahi]] before being conquered in the name of [[Islam]] by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] in the 9th century. It fell to the [[Ghaznavids]] followed by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] before the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century. The area was ruled by [[Arghun|Arghun Khan]] of [[Ilkhanate]], later by the [[Timurids]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

In 1709, when the [[Hotaki dynasty]] rose to power in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], Bamyan was under the [[Mughal Empire]] influence until [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] made it become part of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which became to what is now the modern state of Afghanistan. 

During the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the Hazara rebel leader [[Abdul Ali Mazari]] began spreading influence. He was supported by Iranian politicians. He founded the [[Hezbe Wahdat]] political party in 1989 and was killed by Taliban forces. By 1995, Bamyan province was under the control of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] (Taliban government). They were toppled by US-led forces in late 2001.

=== Recent history ===
After the formation of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]], Bamyan became the focus of rebuilding.
 
The Buddhist remains at Bamyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is hoped that the listing will put continued national and international attention on the site as a whole (including, but not limited to, the statues) in order to ensure its long-term preservation, and to make certain that future restoration efforts maintain the authenticity of the site and that proper preservation practices are followed. Bamyan is also known as the capital of [[Daizangi]] and for its natural beauty.

It is recognised as one of the safest provinces in the country, which has allowed for civil rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/bamian.htm |title=Bamian |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2003-09-22 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamyan served as the base of operations for the [[Military of New Zealand|New Zealand]] [[International Security Assistance Force|peacekeeping force]], a Provincial Reconstruction Team codenamed ''Task Group Crib'', which was part of the network of [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s throughout Afghanistan.

== Politics and governance ==

The current [[governor]] of the province is [[Habiba Sarabi]], Afghanistan's first and, so far, only female governor; she was appointed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8205881.stm British Broadcasting Corporation : ''Putting Bamyan Back on the Map''] Retrieved 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Bamyan]] serves as the capital of the province. All [[Law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] activities throughout the province are controlled by the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) along with the [[Afghan Local Police]] (ALP). The provincial police chief represents the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] in [[Kabul]]. The ANP is backed by other [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF), including the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led forces]].

Bamiyan has been particularly famous for its potatoes.  The region is also known for a "[[shuttle system]]" of planting, wherein seed potatoes are grown in winter in [[Jalalabad]], a warm area of eastern Afghanistan, and then transferred to Bamyan for spring re-planting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSuWNK5Qxn8C&amp;pg=PT73&amp;dq=bamiyan+potatoes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a81FTYSwHMGB8gaalrWBAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=snippet&amp;q=bamiyan&amp;f=false Fueling Growth,health and Prosperity].

The [[shoreline]] is where the land meets the sea and it is continually changing. Over the long term, the water is eroding the land. Beaches represent a special case, in that they exist where sand accumulated from the same processes that strip away rocky and sedimentary material. That is, they can grow as well as erode. [[River delta|River deltas]] are another exception, in that silt that erodes up river can accrete at the river's outlet and extend ocean shorelines. Catastrophic events such as [[tsunami]]s, [[hurricane]]s and [[storm surge]]s accelerate beach erosion, potentially carrying away the entire sand load. Human activities can be as catastrophic as hurricanes, albeit usually over a longer time interval.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Erosion and accretion==

=== Extraordinary processes: tsunamis and hurricane-driven storm surges ===
[[Image:Storm surge graphic.svg|thumb|400px]]
[[Tsunamis]], potentially enormous [[wave]]s often caused by [[earthquake]]s, have great [[erosion]]al and [[sediment]]-reworking potential.  They may strip beaches of [[sand]] that may have taken years to accumulate and may destroy trees and other coastal vegetation.  Tsunamis are also capable of [[flooding]] hundreds of meters inland past the typical high-water level and fast-moving water, associated with the inundating tsunami, can crush homes and other coastal structures.

A [[storm surge]] is an onshore gush of water associated with a [[low pressure]] weather system&amp;mdash;storms.  Storm surges can cause [[Accretion (coastal management)|beach accretion]] and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_96788.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically notable storm surges occurred during the [[North Sea Flood of 1953]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]].

===Gradual processes===
The gradual evolution of beaches often comes from the interaction of [[longshore drift]], a wave-driven process by which sediments move along a beach shore, and other sources of erosion or accretion, such as nearby rivers.

====Deltas====
[[River delta|Deltas]] are nourished by [[alluvial]] systems and accumulate [[sand]] and [[silt]], growing where the sediment flux from land is large enough to avoid complete removal by coastal currents, tides, or waves.

Most modern deltas formed during the last five thousand years, after the present sea-level high stand was attained. However, not all sediment remains permanently in place: in the short term (decades to centuries), exceptional river floods, storms or other energetic events may remove significant portions of delta sediment or change its lobe distribution and, on longer geological time scales, sea-level fluctuations lead to destruction of deltaic features.

====Historical accretion of European beaches====
[[Image:rhone delta img.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Main stages of Holocene evolution of the Rhone delta]]
In the [[Mediterranean sea]], deltas have been continuously growing for the last several thousand years.  Six to seven thousand years ago, the sea level stabilized, and continuous river systems, ephemeral torrents, and other factors began this steady accretion.  Since intense human use of coastal areas is a relatively recent phenomenon (except in the [[Nile]] delta), beach contours were primarily shaped by natural forces until the last centuries.

In [[Barcelona]], for example, the accretion of the coast was a natural process until the late Middle Ages, when [[harbor]]-building increased the rate of [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretion]].

The port of [[Ephesus]], one of the great cities of the [[Ancient Greece|Ionian Greeks]] in [[Asia Minor]], was filled with sediment due to accretion from a nearby river; it is now {{convert|5|km|mi|sp=us}} from the sea. Likewise, [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the once-important port near [[ancient Rome]], is now several kilometers inland, the coastline having moved slowly seaward.

[[Bruges]] became a port during the early Middle Ages and was accessible by sea until around 1050. At that time, however, the natural link between Bruges and the sea silted up.  In 1134, a storm flood opened a deep channel, the [[Zwin]], linking the city to the sea until the fifteenth century via a canal from the Zwin to Bruges. Bruges had to use a number of outports, such as [[Damme]] and [[Sluis]], for this purpose. In 1907, a new seaport was inaugurated in [[Zeebrugge]].

==Modern beach recession==
[[Image:Porto2 eurosion.jpg|Eroding beach in Portugal.|thumb|180px]]
At the present time important segments of low coasts are in recession, losing sand and reducing beach dimensions. This loss can occur very rapidly. There are various reasons for beach recession, some more natural than others (degree of [[anthropization]]). Examples of this are occurring at [[Sète]], in California, in Poland, in [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] (Portugal), and in the Netherlands and elsewhere along the [[North Sea]]. In Europe, coastal erosion is widespread (at least 70%) and distributed very irregularly.

===France===

====Atlantic coast====
[[File:Capbreton Blockhauss vus du Sud.jpg|thumb|300px|Old German-built WWII bunkers at [[Capbreton]], south-west of France]]
Some of the coastal defence bunkers of the [[Atlantic Wall]], built by the German soldiers during the Second World War at the top of the dunes are now underwater 2/3 of the times. It shows 200 meters of recession of the beach in 65 years.

====Sète====

The coast recession near [[Sète]] is related with coastal drift sand supply interruption due to growth of the [[Rhone]] delta, which (like most deltas) is becoming independent of the rest of the coast. The present [[wikt:Lido|lido]] shoreline is 210 meters away from the Roman lido.
===California beaches===
[[California]]'s beaches and other shoreline features change according to the availability of beach sand, the wave and current energy impinging on the coast, and other physical processes that affect the movement of sand. A constant supply of sand is necessary for beaches to form and be maintained along this shoreline. Many human activities, including dam construction and river channelization, have reduced the supply of sand that reaches the ocean.  This, in turn, has prevented beaches from being replenished and has thus created greater vulnerability for shorelines that have always been subject to varying levels of erosion.  There are few practical solutions to improving sand supply from inland sources, so management of shoreline erosion will likely continue to focus at the land/sea interface along the California coastline.

Construction of [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], [[jetties]], or [[groyne]] fields to protect harbor entrances, maintain beaches, or protect coastal structures have both helped and harmed the movement of sand along the shoreline. Protective [[armor (hydrology)|armoring formations]] trap sand and allow beaches to expand up-coast from the device, but can interrupt the flow of sand to beaches located down-coast.

===Poland===
During the last [[glaciation]], the Baltic Polish area was covered in ice and associated morainal sediments. Deglaciation left a substantial amount of unconsolidated sediment. Currently, these unconsolidated sediments are strongly eroded and reworked by the sea.

Image:poland4_eurosion.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aveiro===
The North Portuguese coast and its beaches were fed by large [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] rivers.  The massive building of dams in the [[Douro River]] basin has cut the sediment supply to the [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] coast, resulting in its recession.  Hard protective works have been done all along.

Image:porto2_eurosion.jpg
Image:porto3_eurosion.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[Image:holland 8.jpg|thumb|left|Holland coast]]
The Dutch coast consists of sandy, multi-barred beaches and can be characterised as a wave-dominated coast. Approximately 290&amp;nbsp;km of the coast consists of dunes and 60&amp;nbsp;km is protected by structures such as [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and [[dams]]. With the melting of the ice at the end of the last [[ice age]] the coastline shifted eastward until about 5000 years ago the present position of the Dutch coastline was reached. 

As the [[sea level rise]] stagnated, the sand supply decreased and the formation of the beach ridges stopped, after which when the sea broke through the lines of [[dune]]s during storms, men started to defend the land by building primitive dikes and walls. The dunes, together with the beach and the shoreline, offer a natural, sandy defence to the sea. About 30% of the Netherlands lies below sea level. 

[[Image:holland recession.jpg|thumb|right|Holland coast recession]]

Over the last 30 years, approximately 1 million m³ sand per year has been lost from the Dutch coast to deep water. In most northern coastal sections, erosion occurs in deep water and also in the nearshore zone. In most southern sections, sedimentation occurs in the nearshore zone and erosion in deep water.

Structural erosion is due to sea level rise relative to the land and, in some spots, it is caused by harbour dams. The Dutch coast looked at as a single unit shows erosive behaviour. Approximately 12 million m³ of sand is transferred annually from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Wadden Sea]] as a result of relative rising sea level and coastal erosion.

==Relative sea level changes==
Several geological events and the climate can change (progressively or suddenly) the relative height of the Earth's surface to the [[sea-level]]. These events or processes continuously change coastlines.

===Volcanism and earthquakes===
[[Image:port pozzuolim.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Old sea level mark before these tremors.]]
[[Image:port pozzuoli6.jpg|thumb|150px|right|New quay at the [[Bay of Pozzuoli]]]]

Volcanic activity can create new islands. The {{convert|800|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter [[Surtsey]] Island, [[Iceland]], for example, was created between November 1963 and June 1967. The island has since partially eroded, but it is expected to last another 100 years.

Some earthquakes can create sudden variations of relative ground level and change the coastline dramatically. Structurally controlled coasts include the [[San Andreas fault]] zone in California and the seismic Mediterranean belt (from Gibraltar to Greece).

The Bay of Pozzuoli, in [[Pozzuoli]], Italy experienced hundreds of tremors between August 1982 and December 1984. The tremors, which reached a peak on October 4, 1983, damaged 8,000 buildings in the city center and raised the sea bottom by almost {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}}. This rendered the Bay of [[Pozzuoli]] too shallow for large craft and required the reconstruction of the harbour with new quays. The photo at the upper right shows the harbor before the uplift while the one on the bottom right shows the new quay.

===Gradual processes: subsidence and uplift===
[[Subsidence]] is the motion of the Earth's surface downward relative to the sea level due to internal [[geodynamic]] causes. The opposite of subsidence is [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]], which increases elevation.

[[Image:Venezia acqua alta notte 2005 modificata.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]], [[Venice]], during flooding]]

[[Venice]] is probably the best-known example of a subsiding location.  It experiences periodic flooding when extreme high tides or surges arrive.  This phenomenon is caused by the compaction of young sediments in the [[Po River]] delta area, magnified by subsurface water and gas exploitation. Man-made works to solve this progressive sinking have been unsuccessful.

[[Mälaren]], the third-largest lake in Sweden, is an example of [[glaciation|deglacial]] uplift.  It was once a bay on which seagoing vessels were once able to sail far into the country's interior, but it ultimately became a lake. Its uplift was caused by deglaciation: the removal of the weight of ice-age glaciers caused rapid uplift of the depressed land.  For 2,000 years as the ice was unloaded, uplift proceeded at about {{convert|7.5|cm|in|sp=us}}/year. Once deglaciation was complete, uplift slowed to about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|sp=us}} annually, and it decreased exponentially after that. Today, annual uplift rates are {{convert|1|cm|in|sp=us}} or less, and studies suggest that rebound will continue for about another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation may be up to {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}}.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Monument Valley, late afternoon.jpg|thumb|[[West and East Mitten Buttes|The Mittens]] and [[Merrick Butte]] in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]]]]

In [[geomorphology]], a '''butte''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|t}}) is an isolated [[hill]] with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller [[landform]]s than [[mesa]]s, [[plateau]]s, and [[Table (landform)|tablelands]]. The word "butte" comes from a [[French language|French]] word meaning "small hill"; its use is prevalent in the [[Western United States]], including the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] where "mesa" is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the [[rule of thumb]] that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mesa and Butte | work=Science Clarified | year=2008 | url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230831/http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable buttes==
The [[West and East Mitten Buttes|Mitten Buttes]] of [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many  [[Western (genre)|western-themed]] [[film]]s, including seven movies directed by [[John Ford]].{{refn|name=note1|group=note|The John Ford westerns with location work shot in Monument Valley were ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964).}} The [[Devils Tower]] in northeastern [[Wyoming]] is a [[laccolith]]ic butte composed of [[igneous rock]] rather than [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or other [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Devils Tower National Monument - Geologic Formations | url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm | publisher=National Park Service | date=10 Mar 2014 | accessdate=13 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B D - Devil's Tower select (3) 1.1 (by).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]]]]

Three other notable formations that are either named ''butte'' or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]] in [[Nebraska]] which is actually a collection of five bluffs, [[Crested Butte]] which is a {{convert|12168|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain in [[Colorado]], and [[Elephant Butte Dam|Elephant Butte]] which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in [[New Mexico]].

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are [[Bear Butte]], [[South Dakota]], [[Black Butte (Oregon)|Black Butte]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Sutter Buttes]] in [[California]]. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word ''butte'', for example, [[Courthouse Rock]], Nebraska.  Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word ''butte'', examples of which are [[Kamiak Butte]] and Chelan Butte in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].

==Formation==
Buttes form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] when hard [[caprock]] overlies a layer of less resistant [[rock (geology)|rock]] that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the [[scree]] or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Davis, George Herbert|year=1999|title=Structural Geology of the Colorado Plateau Region of Southern Utah, with Special Emphasis on Deformation Bands|series=G.S.A.

'''City marketing''' (related to '''city branding''') is the promotion of a [[city]], or a [[district]] within it, with the aim of encouraging certain activities to take place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to alter the external perceptions of a city in order to encourage [[tourism]], attract inward migration of residents, or enable business relocation. A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or 'flagship', buildings and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]].

An example of this is [[Maranello]], Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|title=What To Do|last=|first=|date=April 6, 2017|website=Maranello|archive-url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|archive-date=April 6, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City marketing can occur ''strategically'' or ''organically''. An example of strategic city marketing is  [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Spillman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LVCVA: What works here, stays here |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/43023617.html |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |publisher= |date= 2009-04-15|accessdate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110612234127/http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the [[perception]] of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts. 

According to [[Scott Cutlip]], "one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs" was led by [[Erastus Brainerd]] for the city of [[Seattle]] beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supplied for the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the city’s [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cutlip (1995) ''Public Relations History'', "Seattle shows the way for cities", pp 166,7&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a city's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Branding|last=Dinnie|first=Keith|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-24185-5|location=New York|pages=150–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Construction surveying''' or '''building surveying''' (otherwise known as "staking", "stake-out", "lay-out", "setting-out" or "BS") is to stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings. These markers are usually staked out according to a suitable coordinate system selected for the project.

== History of construction surveying ==

* The nearly perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], built c. 2700 BC, affirm the [[Egyptians]]' command of surveying.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*A recent reassessment of [[Stonehenge]] (c.2500 BC) suggests that the monument was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the sixth century BC geometric based techniques were used to construct the [[tunnel of Eupalinos]] on the island of Samos.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*As modern times come and new technology comes the more accurate and more efficient surveying has become.  For example surveyors used to use two posts with a chain in between to measure distance, this technology could only account for the distance and not the elevation.  The new technology that is used today, known as GPS can measure the distance from point A to point B as well as accounting for the elevation differences.  The new technology is able to do this because it uses radar and radio frequencies.((Bernold, L. E. (2002). Spatial Integration in Construction. Journal of Construction Engineering &amp; Management, 128(5), 400-408.))

==Elements of the construction survey==

* Survey existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure whenever possible (for example, measuring invert elevations and diameters of sewers at manholes);
* Stake out lot corners, stake limit of work and stake location of construction trailer (clear of all excavation and construction)
* Stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures
* Verify the location of structures during construction; 
* Provide horizontal control on multiple floors.
* Conduct an As-Built survey: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

==Coordinate systems used in construction==

Land surveys and surveys of existing conditions are generally performed according to [[geodesic]] coordinates.  However for the purposes of construction a more suitable coordinate system will often be used.  During construction surveying, the surveyor will often have to convert from geodesic coordinates to the coordinate system used for that project.

=== Chainage or station ===

In the case of roads or other linear [[infrastructure]], a ''[[chainage]]'' (derived from [[Gunter's Chain]] - 1 chain is equal to 66 feet or 100 links) will be established, often to correspond with the centre line of the road or pipeline.  During construction, structures would then be located in terms of ''chainage'', ''offset'' and ''elevation''. ''Offset'' is said to be "left" or "right" relative to someone standing on the ''chainage line'' who is looking in the direction of increasing ''chainage''.  Plans would often show ''plan'' views (viewed from above), ''profile'' views (a "transparent" section view collapsing all section views of the road parallel to the ''chainage'') or ''cross-section'' views (a "true" section view perpendicular to the ''chainage'').  In a ''plan'' view, ''chainage'' generally increases from left to right, or from the bottom to the top of the plan.  ''Profiles'' are shown with the chainage increasing from left to right, and ''cross-sections'' are shown as if the viewer is looking in the direction of increasing ''chainage'' (so that the "left" ''offset'' is to the ''left'' and the "right" ''offset'' is to the ''right'').

"Chainage" may also be referred to as "Station".

===Building grids===

In the case of buildings, an arbitrary system of grids is often established so as to correspond to the rows of columns and the major load-bearing walls of the building.  The grids may be identified alphabetically in one direction, and numerically in the other direction (as in a road map).  The grids are usually but not necessarily perpendicular, and are often but not necessarily evenly spaced. Floors and basement levels are also numbered. Structures, equipment or architectural details may be located in reference to the floor and the nearest intersection of the arbitrary axes.

=== Other coordinate systems===

In other types of construction projects, arbitrary "plan north" reference lines may be established, using Cartesian coordinates that may or may not necessarily correspond to true coordinates. The technique is called localized grid.
This method uses the plan building grids as their own ordinates. A point of beginning is established at the southwest cross grid. 
IE [N1000.000,E3000.000] 
The grids are added together heading north and east to make each line its own ordinate.

==Equipment and techniques used in construction surveying==

Surveying equipment, such as levels and [[theodolite]]s, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, [[total station|electronic distance measurement (EDM)]], [[total station]]s, GPS surveying and laser scanning have supplemented (and to a large extent supplanted) the traditional optical instruments.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[builder's level]] measures neither horizontal nor vertical angles. It simply combines a spirit level and telescope to allow the user to visually establish a line of sight along a level plane. When used together with a graduated staff it can be used to transfer elevations from one location to another. An alternative method to transfer elevation is to use water in a transparent hose as the level of the water in the hose at opposite ends will be at the same elevation.  A [[Pentaprism#Pentaprism in surveying|double right angle prism]] verifies grid patterns, isolating layout errors. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Equipment and techniques used in mining and tunneling==

Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in [[mining]] surveying.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Underground mining===
A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls' ([[Stoping (mining method)|stopes]]), ceilings (backs), and floors as the [[drift (mining)|drifts]] of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data is then downloaded into a [[CAD programme]], and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and [[Resection (orientation)|resection]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Profession {{anchor|Professional status of construction surveyors}} ==
'''Building Surveying''' emerged in the 1970s as a profession in the [[United Kingdom]] by a group of technically minded [[General Practice Surveyors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig.net/pub/athens/papers/ts12/TS12_4_Kibblewhite_Wilkinson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Building Surveying is a recognized profession within [[UK|Britain]] and [[Australia]]. In Australia in particular, due to risk mitigation/limitation factors the employment of surveyors at all levels of the construction industry is widespread. There are still many countries where it is not widely recognized as a profession. The Services that Building Surveyors undertake are broad but include:{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

*Project Management and monitoring
*CDM Co-ordinator under the Construction (Design &amp; Management) Regulations 2015
*Property Legislation adviser
*Insurance assessment and claims assistance
*Defect investigation and maintenance adviser

Building Surveyors also advise on many aspects of construction including:{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

* design
* maintenance
* repair
* refurbishment
* restoration
* conservation
Clients of a building surveyor can be the public sector, Local Authorities, Government Departments as well as private sector organisations and work closely with [[architects]], planners, homeowners and tenants groups. Building Surveyors may also be called to act as an [[expert witness]]. It is usual for building surveyors to undertake an accredited degree qualification before undertaking structured training to become a member of a professional organisation. For [[Chartered Building Surveyor]]s, these courses are accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  Other professional organisations that have building surveyor members include [[Chartered Institute of Building|CIOB]], [[ABE (organisation)|ABE]], [[Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors|HKIS]] and [[RICS]].

With the enlargement of the European community, the profession of the Chartered Building Surveyor is becoming more widely known in other European states, particularly France.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Chartered Building Surveyors, where many English speaking people buy second homes.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Distinction from land surveyors===

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession. Land surveyors have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicated the creation of new boundary lines and roads).

'''Dzungaria''' ({{IPAc-en|(|d|)|z|ʊ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə}}; also spelled '''Zungaria''', '''Dzungharia''' or '''Zungharia''', '''Dzhungaria''' or '''Zhungaria''', or '''Djungaria''' or '''Jungaria''') is a [[geographical region]] in [[northwest China]] corresponding to the northern half of [[Xinjiang]], also known as '''Beijiang''' ({{zh |c = 北疆 |p = Běijiāng |l = Northern Xinjiang}}).&lt;ref name="Starr2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Formerly the term could cover a wider area, conterminous with the [[Dzungar Khanate]], a state led by the [[Oirats]] in the 18th century which was based in the area.

Although geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Tarim Basin]] area, the [[Qing dynasty]] and subsequent Chinese governments integrated both areas into one province, Xinjiang. As the center of Xinjiang's heavy industry, generator of most of Xinjiang's GDP, as well as containing its political capital [[Ürümqi]] ("beautiful pasture" in [[Oirat language|Oirat]]), northern Xinjiang continues to attract intraprovincial and interprovincial migration to its cities. In comparison to southern Xinjiang (''Nanjiang'', or the Tarim Basin), Dzungaria is relatively well integrated with the rest of China by rail and trade links.&lt;ref name="Stahle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/item/etd-Stahle-2942.pdf|title=Ethnic Resistance and State Environmental Policy: Uyghurs and Mongols|first=Laura N|last=Stahle|date=August 2009|publisher=University of southern California}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Dzungaria or Zungharia is a corruption of the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] term "Zűn Gar" or "Jüün Gar" depending on the dialect of Mongolian used. "Zűn"/"Jüün" means "left" and "Gar" means "hand". The name originates from the notion that the Western Mongols are on the left-hand side when the Mongol Empire began its division into East and West Mongols. After this fragmentation, the western Mongolian nation was called "Zuun Gar".

== Background ==
[[File:Xinjiang regions simplified.png|thumb|right|Dzungaria (red) and the Tarim Basin (blue)]]

[[File:Xinjiang regions.png|thumb|left|Northern Xinjiang - Dzungharian Basin (yellow), Eastern Xinjiang - [[Turpan Depression]] ([[Turpan Prefecture]] and [[Hami Prefecture]]) (red), Southern Xinjiang - Tarim Basin (blue)]]

[[Xinjiang]] consists of two main geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct regions, Dzungaria north of the Tianshan Mountains and the [[Tarim Basin]] south of the Tianshan Mountains, before [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] unified them into one political entity called [[Xinjiang]] province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Dzungar people]], while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, [[Turkic languages|Turkic speaking]] [[Muslim]] farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]].

The Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tianshan and Turkic Muslim south of the Tianshan, and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing and it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather it was the Chinese who held that point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing rule, no sense of "regional identity" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui, and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate parts be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dzungarian Basin==
[[File:Altai, Tienschan-Orte.png|thumb|250px|Right|Physical map showing the separation of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Taklamakan) by the Tien Shan Mountains]]

The core of Dzungaria is the triangular Dzungarian Basin, also known as '''Jungar Basin''', or in Chinese as {{zh
|s=准噶尔盆地
|t=準噶爾盆地
|p=Zhǔngá'ěr Péndì}}, with its central [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]].
It is bounded by the [[Tian Shan]] to the south, the [[Altai Mountains]] to the northeast and the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The three corners are relatively open. The northern corner is the valley of the upper [[Irtysh River]]. The western corner is the [[Dzungarian Gate]], a historically important gateway between Dzungaria and the Kazakh Steppe; presently, a highway and a [[Lanxin Railway|railway]] (opened in 1990) run through it, connecting China with Kazakhstan. The eastern corner of the basin leads to [[Gansu]] and the rest of China. In the south, an easy pass leads from [[Ürümqi]] to the [[Turfan Depression]]. In the southwest, the tall [[Borohoro Mountains]] branch of the [[Tian Shan]] separates the basin from the upper [[Ili River]].

The basin is similar to the larger [[Tarim Basin]] on the southern side of the Tian Shan Range. Only a gap in the mountains to the north allows moist air masses to provide the basin lands with enough moisture to remain semi-desert rather than becoming a true desert like most of the Tarim Basin and allows a thin layer of vegetation to grow. This is enough to sustain populations of wild [[Bactrian camel|camel]]s, [[jerboa]]s, and other wild species.&lt;ref name=nationalgeo&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion

The Dzungarian basin does not have a single [[drainage basin|catchment]] center. The northernmost section of Dzungaria is part of the basin of the [[Irtysh River]], which ultimately drains into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The rest of the region is split into a number of [[endorheic basins]]. In particular, south of the Irtysh, the [[Ulungur River]] ends up in the (presently) [[endorheic]] [[Lake Ulungur]]. The Southwestern part of the Dzungarian basin drains into the 
[[Aibi Lake]]. In the west-central part of the region, streams flow into (or toward) a group of endorheic lakes that include [[Lake Manas]] and [[Lake Ailik]]. During the region's geological past, a much larger lake (the "Old Manas Lake") was located in the area of today's Manas Lake; it was fed not only by the streams that presently flow toward it but also by the Irtysh and Ulungur, which too were flowing toward the Old Manas Lake at the time.&lt;ref name=arid&gt;{{citation|journal=Journal of Arid Land|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=167–173|title=Tectonic geomorphological characteristics for evolution of the Manas Lake

The cold climate of nearby Siberia influences the climate of the Dzungarian Basin, making the temperature colder—as low as {{convert|-4|°F}}—and providing more precipitation, ranging from {{convert|3|to|10|in}}, compared to the warmer, drier basins to the south. Runoff from the surrounding mountains into the basin supplies several lakes. The ecologically rich habitats traditionally included meadows, marshlands, and rivers. However, most of the land is now used for agriculture.&lt;ref name=nationalgeo/&gt;

It is a largely [[steppe]] and semi-desert basin surrounded by high mountains: the [[Tian Shan]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]) in the south and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] in the north. Geologically it is an extension of the Paleozoic [[Kazakhstan Block]] and was once part of an independent continent before the Altai mountains formed in the late Paleozoic. It does not contain the abundant minerals of Kazakhstan and may have been a pre-existing continental block before the Kazakhstan Block was formed.

[[Ürümqi]], [[Yining (city)|Yining]] and [[Karamai]] are the main cities; other smaller [[oasis]] towns dot the piedmont areas.

===Paleontology===
Dzungaria and its derivatives are used to name a number of pre-historic animals&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group, Norman Lockyer, 1869&lt;/ref&gt; hailing from the rocky outcrops located in the Dzungar Basin:
*''[[Dsungaripterus]] weii'' ([[pterosaur]])
*''[[Junggarsuchus]] sloani'' ([[crocodylomorph]])

A recent notable find, in February 2006, is the oldest [[tyrannosaur]] fossil unearthed by a team of scientists from [[George Washington University]] who were conducting a study in the Dzungarian Basin. The species, named ''[[Guanlong]]'', lived 160 million years ago, more than 90 million years before the famed ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Ecology==
Dzungaria is home to a semi-desert [[steppe]] [[ecoregion]] known as the '''Dzungarian Basin semi-desert'''. The vegetation consists mostly of low scrub of ''[[Anabasis brevifolia]]''. Taller shrublands of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] bush ''(Haloxylon ammodendron)'' and ''[[Ephedra przewalskii]]'' can be found near the margins of the basin. Streams descending from the Tian Shan and Altai ranges support stands of [[Populus|poplar]] ''(Populus diversifolia)'' together with ''Nitraria roborovsky, N. sibirica, [[Achnatherum splendens]],'' [[tamarisk]] ''(Tamarix sibirimosissima)'', and [[willow]] ''([[Salix ledebouriana]])''.

The northeastern portion of the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert lies within [[Great Gobi National Park]], and is home to herds of [[Onager]]s ''(Equus hemionus)'', [[goitered gazelle]]s ''(Gazella subgutturosa)'' and [[Wild Bactrian camel]]s ''(Camelus ferus)''.

The basin was one of the last [[habitat]]s of [[Przewalski's horse]] ''(Equus przewalskii)'', also known as Dzungarian horse, which was once [[extinct]] in the wild, though it has since been reintroduced in areas of Mongolia and China.

==History==
{{Main|History of Xinjiang}}
[[File:Renat map.jpg|thumb|A map of the Dzungar Khanate, by a [[Johan Gustaf Renat|Swedish officer]] in captivity there in 1716-1733, which include the region known today as [[Zhetysu]]]]
The first people to inhabit the region were [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] peoples such as the [[Tocharians]] in prehistory and the [[Jushi Kingdom]] in the first millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=35, 37, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the 21st century, all or part of the region has been ruled or controlled by the [[Xiongnu Empire]], [[Han dynasty]], [[Xianbei state]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Turkic Khaganate]], [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]], [[Mongol Empire]], [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Chagatai Khanate]], [[Moghulistan]], [[Qara Del]], [[Northern Yuan Dynasty|Northern Yuan]], [[Four Oirat]], [[Dzungar Khanate]], [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and, since 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]].

One of the earliest mentions of the Dzungaria region occurs when the [[Han dynasty]] dispatched an explorer to investigate lands to the west, using the northernmost [[Silk Road]] trackway of about {{convert|2600|km}} in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of [[Xi'an]] to the west over the [[Wushao Ling Pass]] to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]] and emerged in [[Kashgar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C.Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istämi]] of the [[Göktürks]] received the lands of Dzungaria as an inheritance after the death of his father in the latter half of the sixth century [[AD]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', By René Grousset&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzungaria is named after a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] kingdom which existed in [[Central Asia]] during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It derived its name from the [[Dzungars]], who were so called because they formed the left wing (''züün'', left; ''gar'', hand) of the Mongolian army, self-named [[Oirats]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dzungaria|volume=8|page=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dzungar power reached its height in the second half of the 17th century, when [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan]] repeatedly intervened in the affairs of the [[Kazakhs]] to the west, but it was completely destroyed by the [[Kazakhs]] about 1757–1759. It has played an important part in the history of [[Mongolia]] and the great migrations of Mongolian stems westward. Its widest limit included [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Khotan]], the whole region of the [[Tian Shan]], and the greater proportion of that part of Central Asia which extends from 35° to 50° N and from 72° to 97° E.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

After 1761, its territory fell mostly to the [[Qing dynasty]] during [[Ten Great Campaigns|the campaign against the Dzungars]] ([[Xinjiang]] and north-western Mongolia) and partly to [[Russian Turkestan]] (the earlier Kazakh state provinces of [[Zhetysu]] and Irtysh river).

After the [[Dzungar genocide]], the Qing subsequently began to repopulate the area with Han and Hui people from China Proper.

The population in the 21st century consists of [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] and [[Han Chinese]]. Since 1953, northern Xinjiang has attracted skilled workers from all over China—who have mostly been [[Han Chinese]]—to work on water conservation and industrial projects, especially the [[Karamay]] oil fields. Intraprovincial migration has mostly been directed towards Dzungaria also, with immigrants from the poor Uyghur areas of southern Xinjiang flooding to the provincial capital of [[Ürümqi]] to find work.

As a political or geographical term ''Dzungaria'' has practically disappeared from the map; but the range of mountains stretching north-east along the southern frontier of the Zhetysu, as the district to the southeast of [[Lake Balkhash]] preserves the name of [[Dzungarian Alatau]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It also gave name to [[Djungarian hamster]]s.

===Dzungaria and the Silk Road===
A traveller going west from China must go either north of the Tian Shan mountains through Dzungaria or south of the mountains through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the south side and migrations the north. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with south side was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. There is also another reason. The Taklamakan is too dry to support much grass, and therefore nomads when they are not robbing caravans. Its inhabitants live mostly in oases formed where rivers run out of the mountains into the desert. These are inhabited by peasants who are unwarlike and merchants who have an interest in keeping trade running smoothly. Dzungaria has a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west.  Therefore, trade went south and migrations north.&lt;ref&gt;Grosset, 'The Empire of the Steppes', p xxii,&lt;/ref&gt; Today most trade is north of the mountains ([[Dzungarian Gate]] and [[Khorgas]] in the Ili valley) to avoid the mountains west of the Tarim and because Russia is currently more developed.

==Economy==
[[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[sugar beet]]s are grown, and [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[horse]]s are raised. The fields are irrigated with melted snow from the permanently white-capped mountains.

Dzungaria has deposits of [[coal]], [[iron]], and [[gold]], as well as large [[oil field]]s.

An '''emergent coastline''' is a stretch along the coast that has been exposed by the sea by a relative fall in sea levels by either [[isostasy]] or [[eustasy]].{{citation needed (lead)|date=December 2013}}

Emergent coastline are the opposite of [[submergent coastline]]s, which have experienced a relative rise in sea levels.

The emergent coastline may have several specific [[landform]]s:
* [[Raised beach]] or [[machair]]
* [[Wave cut platform]]
* Sea cave such as King's Cave, [[Isle of Arran]]

The [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''machair'' or ''machar'' refers to a fertile low-lying raised beach found on some of the coastlines of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] (especially the [[Outer Hebrides]].

[[Hudson Bay]], in [[Canada]]'s north, is an example of an emergent coastline. It is still emerging by as much as 1 cm per year.{{cn|date=December 2013}} Another example of emergent coastline is the [[Eastern Coastal Plains]] of the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

'''Ethnoecology''' is the [[scientific method|scientific]] study of how different groups of people living in different locations understand the [[ecosystem]]s around them, and their relationships with surrounding environments.

It seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mHj3RfaLCFYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ethnoecology&amp;ots=xsl7-Ob-kj&amp;sig=gkKc38x93_fuB0S3Bo9IDTKwRvw#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnoecology&amp;f=false|title=Ethnoecology: Situated Knowledge/located Lives|last=Nazarea|first=Virginia D.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816523641|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ethno" (see [[ethnology]]) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with [[ecology]], signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IryOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=latin+morpeme+ethno&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nRnF23dRA&amp;sig=LqE5uvdEmUIlTDLCpYAogk8yOo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRxMjZk7TeAhWaHzQIHawABSMQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20morpeme%20ethno&amp;f=false|title=General Linguistics|last=Robins|first=R. H.|date=2014-05-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317887638|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of [[botany]] and placing it in a global context.

== History ==
Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. [[Hugh Popenoe]], an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr [[Harold Conklin]], a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In his 1954 dissertation "The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as "ethnoecological". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo.

In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His "Hanunoo Color Categories" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects.

Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to [[Taxonomy (biology)|Western scientific taxonomies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prado|first=Helbert Medeiros|last2=Murrieta|first2=Rui Sérgio Sereni|last3=Prado|first3=Helbert Medeiros|last4=Murrieta|first4=Rui Sérgio Sereni|date=2015-12|title=ETHNOECOLOGY IN PERSPECTIVE: THE ORIGINS, INTERFACES AND CURRENT TRENDS OF A GROWING FIELD|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2015000400009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Ambiente &amp;amp; Sociedade|volume=18|issue=4|pages=139–160|doi=10.1590/1809-4422ASOC986V1842015|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

[[Ethnoscience]] emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754670|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lehigh.edu/~dac511/pages/research/ethnoecol.html|title=Ethnoecology, David Casagrande|website=www.lehigh.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist’s toolkit;  it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers "worth attending to" in their ecological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864107613|title=An ethnoecological approach to the study of a village Himachal Pradesh|last=Anindita.|first=Ghosh,|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=9783659305320|edition=1. Aufl|location=Saarbrücken|oclc=864107613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in [[environmental anthropology]].

Ethnoecology is a field of [[environmental anthropology]], and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. [[Franz Boas]] was one of the first anthropologists to question [[unilineal evolution]], the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards [[Western civilization]]. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an [[emic]] standpoint in order to understand different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Irving|date=1959|title=Evolution and Anthropology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3825587|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=55–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Steward]] was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term [[cultural ecology]], the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Ecological%20Anthropology|title=Ecological Anthropology - Anthropological Theories - Department of Anthropology - The University of Alabama|website=anthropology.ua.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new perspective on [[cultural evolution]] was  later named [[multilineal evolution]]. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist [[Leslie White]].  White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as [[System|systems]] and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of [[Cultural system|cultural systems]] with [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.

== Traditional ecological knowledge ==

[[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]] (TEK), also known as [[Indigenous Knowledge]], "refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/traditional-knowledge.html|title=Fish and Wildlife Service - Native American Liaison|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community’s shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their [[worldview]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|last2=Folke|first2=Mina Kislalioglu, Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav|date=1998-09-01|title=Minireviews: Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100219900034|journal=Ecosystems|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=409–415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034|issn=1432-9840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Humans, for example, can represent a [[keystone species]] in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as [[pedogenesis]], [[seed dispersal]], and fluctuations in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Biodiversity, Resilience and Sustainability|date=1994|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|work=Biodiversity Conservation: Problems and Policies|pages=269–287|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|isbn=9780792331407|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Folke|first2=Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also modify and condition [[Ethology|animal behavior]] in either wild or domesticated species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. 

==Local knowledge in western society==

Within the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed "[[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]," "[[traditional]]," or "[[Noble savage|savage]]," a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul" /&gt;  Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a "static, timeless, and hermetically sealed" notion.&lt;ref name="cruikshank_glaciers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Glaciers Listen? : Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters, and Social Imagination|last=Cruikshank|first=Julie|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2005|location=Seattle|pages=9}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;  Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a [[post-industrial society]], such as that of the United States.

In this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the ''other''.  For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them.  Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood.  This broadening of the discipline (bordering on [[human ecology]]) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to.

Similarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty" /&gt; This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.

== Traditional Medicine ==
Traditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine: In Depth|website=NCCIH|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 80% of the world’s population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Norman R.|last2=Akerele|first2=Olayiwola|last3=Bingel|first3=Audrey S.|last4=Soejarto|first4=Djaja D.|last5=Guo|first5=Zhengang|date=1985|title=Medicinal plants in therapy |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=63|issue=6|pages=965–981 |pmc=2536466|pmid=3879679}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-02-01|title=Ecology and ethnomedicine: Exploring links between current environmental crisis and indigenous medical practices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0277953694E0098D|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)E0098-D|issn=0277-9536}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Ayurveda from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rastogi|first=Sanjeev|last2=Kaphle|first2=Krishna|date=2011|title=Sustainable Traditional Medicine: Taking the Inspirations from Ancient Veterinary Science|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/151435/|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|language=en|volume=2011|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/ecam/nen071|issn=1741-427X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological concerns==

According to Dove and Carpenter, "environmental anthropology sits astride the [[dichotomy]] between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.".&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

This is especially relevant due to the role in which scientists have long understood how humans have worked for and against their environmental surroundings as a whole.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|year=1998|title=Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|journal=Ecosystems|volume=1|issue=4|pages=409–415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit" /&gt;  As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as [[Darrell A. Posey]], John Eddins, Peter Macbeth and Debbie Myers.&lt;ref name="posey_amazonian"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the recognition of indigenous knowledge in the intersection of Western science is the way in which it is incorporated, if at all.  Dove and Carpenter contend that some anthropologists have sought to reconcile the two through a "translation," bringing the ethnological understandings and framing them in a modern dialogue.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

In opposition to this paradigm is an attribution to the linguistic and ideological distinctiveness found in the nomenclature and epistemologies.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This alone has created a subfield, mostly in recognition of the philosophies in [[ethnotaxonomy]].&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology" /&gt;  To define ethnotaxonomy as new or different though, is inaccurate.  It is simply placing a different understanding of a long-held tradition in ethnology, discovering the terms in which different peoples use to describe their world and worldviews.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology" /&gt;  It is worth noting that those who seek to use and understand this knowledge have actively worked to both enfranchise and disenfranchise the societies in which the information was held.&lt;ref name="haenn_conservatism"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haenn has noted that in several instances of working with conservationists and developers, there was a concerted effort to change the ideas of environment and ecology held by the native groups to the land, while plundering any and all texts and information on the resources found there, therefore enabling a resettlement of the land and redistribution of the knowledge, favoring the outsiders.&lt;ref name="haenn_conservatism" /&gt;

'''''Geographers on Film''''' is an archival series of more than 300 filmed and taped interviews with various distinguished geographers dating back to 1970. The series was created as an educational resource by geographer Maynard Weston Dow, [[Plymouth State University]], and his wife, Nancy Freeman Dow. The series was supported in part by the [[Association of American Geographers]] (AAG),&lt;ref name="AAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aag.org/galleries/meridian-files/200804Meridian.pdf|title=Archiving and Accessing Geography’s History|date=April 2008|publisher=Association of American Geographers|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Science Foundation]], Plymouth State University, and the Marion and Jasper Whiting Foundation, of Boston.

The '''Hakluyt Society''' is a [[text publication society]], founded in 1846 and based in [[London, England]], which publishes scholarly editions of [[Primary source|primary records]] of historic voyages, travels and other geographical material. In addition to its publishing role, the Society organises and participates in meetings, symposia and conferences relating to the history of geographical exploration and cultural encounter. It is a [[registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;*{{EW charity|313168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a non-profitmaking institution administered by a voluntary team of council members and officers. Membership is open to all with an interest in its aims.

The Society is named after [[Richard Hakluyt]] (1552–1616), a collector and editor of narratives of voyages and travels and other documents relating to English interests overseas.

==Foundation==
[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow.jpg|thumb|right| [[Richard Hakluyt]], after whom the Society is named, pictured in a stained glass window of c.1905 in [[Bristol Cathedral]] ]]
The Society was created at a meeting convened in the [[London Library]], St James's Square, on 15 December 1846. Under the chairmanship of the geologist Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], it established an eight-man steering group which included the geographer and historian [[William Desborough Cooley]]; the Army medical officer Dr [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]]; the naval officer and surveyor Sir [[Charles Malcolm]]; the antiquary [[Bolton Corney]]; the British Museum Principal Librarian Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]]; the physicist and mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], FRS; and [[John Edward Gray]], Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum. Cooley had previously criticised the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for relying too heavily on contemporary materials in the solution of geographical problems, arguing that the scientific study of geography should involve a far wider analysis and appreciation of earlier sources. He took the major role during the Society's formative period, assisted by Corney and Smith, while Murchison occupied little more than a figurehead position.

Cooley had proposed that the society should be known as the "Columbus Society", but at the inaugural Council Meeting on 26 January 1847 it was decided that it be named in commemoration of [[Richard Hakluyt]]. Not only did Hakluyt's name as a recorder of voyages, rather than an explorer in his own right, better reflect the society's aims, but it also proclaimed its central ambition, which was to advance Hakluyt's work into the modern age. A resolution was adopted whereby the Society would print and circulate to its members, for a subscription of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] per annum, rare accounts of voyages, travels and geographical records dating from any period prior to [[William Dampier]]'s circumnavigation (effectively before the end of the 17th century). Meetings were initially held in a room at the London Library, but in 1849 transferred to the offices of the Society's printer in [[St Martin's Lane]], and from 1850 in [[Great Queen Street]]. From 1872 they were held at the Royal Geographical Society's premises, originally in [[Savile Row]] and subsequently in [[Kensington Gore]].

A General Meeting on 4 March 1847 agreed a constitution and a list of works to be published. The Society was to be governed by a President (Murchison), two Vice-Presidents (Charles Malcolm and Revd H. H. Milman), a Secretary (Cooley) and 17 elected council members. The first year's Council included – in addition to the members of the original steering group – [[Charles Darwin]], [[Charles Beke]], Captain [[Charles Ramsay Drinkwater Bethune]] and the scholar [[Richard Henry Major]].

The Society attracted 220 members in its first two years. Its first publication, Bethune's ''Observations of Sir Richard Hawkins'', appeared in December 1847; followed by Major's ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'' (printed 1847 but published in January 1848). Richard Hakluyt's ''Divers Voyages touching the Discovery of America'', which the Society had intended for its inaugural publication, was postponed until 1850. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Schomburgk's edition of Ralegh's voyage to Guiana had appeared (1849), together with Cooley's ''Sir Francis Drake his Voyage'' (1849), Thomas Rundall's ''Voyages towards the North-West'', and Major's ''Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia''. Early print-runs were relatively small – around 250 copies to satisfy the existing membership, with a few to spare – at a cost to the Society in the region of £50–60.

==Later development==
Murchison served as President until his death in 1871, although his position was largely honorary. He was succeeded by Sir [[David Dundas (politician)|David Dundas]] (1871–77),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dundas, David (1799-1877) (DNB00)|Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer and politician, and then by [[Sir Henry Yule]] (1877–89), an Oriental scholar and former [[East India Company]] soldier. Yule took a more direct interest in the editing of the society's publications than either Murchison or Dundas, and it was his decision that all future volumes should be indexed. R. H. Major, who had taken over as Secretary from Cooley in 1849, held the office until 1858 when his place was taken by the geographer, historian and expedition promoter [[Clements Markham]]. Markham served as Secretary 1858–87, and as President 1889–1909, and personally edited no fewer than 29 volumes. From 1893 he was assisted by [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]], the East India Company historian and India Office archivist, who served as Secretary until 1902. The first permanent Treasurer, appointed in 1908, was Edward Heawood, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian: he remained in office for thirty-eight years.

In 1908, the final year of Markham's rule, the Society broke with tradition and published its first post-1700 text, Bolton Corney's ''Voyage of Captain Don [[Felipe González de Ahedo|Felipe Gonzalez]]''.

In 1909 Markham was succeeded as President by Sir Albert Gray, an ex-member of the Ceylon Civil Service. From this time onwards the Society began to extend its activity beyond that of publication. It supported the establishment of a memorial to Richard Hakluyt in [[Bristol Cathedral]] in 1911, and in 1914 Gray represented the Society on the [[British Academy]] Committee involved in organising the [[Shakespeare]] Tercentenary. The period also saw the emergence of women as editors and translators, notably Sigfus Blondal, Bertha Philpotts, Lavinia Anstey and Zelia Nuttall. Membership increased, largely on account of institutional subscriptions which by 1911 accounted for half of the 440 members. Sir William Foster, the former Secretary, served as President 1928–1945, and then as Vice-president until his death in 1951. Foster's skill in annotating rubbed off on his editors and resulted in a period distinguished by considerable improvements in the quality of the Society's publications, together with a steady growth in membership to more than 2000. Foster was succeeded in 1945 by Edward Lynam, Superintendent of the Map Room at the [[British Museum]] (now the [[British Library]]) and the first of a line of post-war presidents whose terms of office were restricted to a period of five years. In the post-war period the Society's publication programme benefited from the labours of those of its voluntary officers who also took on editorial responsibilities, including [[Raleigh Ashlin Skelton|R. A. Skelton]], Eila Campbell, Terence Armstrong, [[Sarah Tyacke]], Michael Brennan, Robin Law and Will Ryan.

==Publications==
The main activity of the Society is the publication of scholarly editions of [[primary source]]s on the voyages and travels undertaken by individuals in many parts of the globe. These include early accounts dealing with the [[geography]], [[ethnology]] and [[natural history]] of the regions visited. The Society has to date published over 200 editions in some 350 volumes. All editions are published in English.

Although many of the Society's past editions relate to British ventures, with documentary sources in English, the majority concern non-British enterprises and are based on texts in languages other than English. Translations from Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French or Dutch have regularly appeared, and occasional translations from Russian, Greek, Latin, Amharic, Mandarin, Persian or Arabic. The translation in which the material is presented is normally a fresh version, but has sometimes been an earlier rendering, checked and corrected as necessary.

All editions contain scholarly annotation to elucidate the complexities of the text, and to place it in its wider historical context. Volumes are produced in a standard binding, and generally contain maps and contemporary illustrations. The Society's logo, which appears on the cover of all volumes, is a vignette of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ship, the ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''.

Editions have dealt with the following explorers: [[Ibn Battuta]], [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]], [[Pedro Cieza de León]], [[John Cabot]], [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], [[James Cook]], [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Semyon Dezhnev]], [[Francis Drake]], [[Humphrey Gilbert]], [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]], [[Ludwig Leichhardt]], [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], [[Ma Huan]], [[Olaus Magnus]], [[Arthur J. M. Jephson]], [[Jens Munk]], [[William of Rubruck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Journey of William of Rubruck to the Eastern Parts of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/journeywilliamr01ruysgoog|website=The Hakluyt Society|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[George Vancouver]].

The Society published 100 volumes in its First Series, from 1847 to 1899. The Second Series ran from 1899 to 1998, and accounted for 190 volumes. The Third Series, in a larger format, began in 1999, and by the end of 2016 had reached 31 volumes. These included a 3-volume journal of The [[Malaspina Expedition]], published in association with the [[Museo Naval de Madrid]].

Currently, two volumes are published on average each year.

===Extra Series===
In addition to its regular series, the Society publishes a separate Extra Series, comprising books which are too expensive in their production to be freely distributed, but which are made available to members at reduced prices. Publications of this type first appeared in 1903–07 with C. R. Beazley's annotated extracts from Hakluyt, and the multi-volume MacLehose editions of Hakluyt's ''Principal Navigations'' and Purchas's ''Pilgrimes''. These are now treated as volumes 1–33 of the Extra Series, although only a few sets of the MacLehose printings appeared in Hakluyt Society binding, and none carried the Extra Series imprint. The concept was revived and formally designated in the 1950s with the publication of the ''Journals of Captain James Cook'' (4 volumes, 1955–67, numbered as Extra Series vols 34–37), followed by other titles including the monumental ''Charts &amp; Coastal Views of Captain Cook's Voyages'' (1988–92). The Extra Series had reached 47 volumes by the end of 2012.

==Other activities==
The Society's Annual General Meeting and Annual Lecture is held at the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Its website hosts a [[discussion group]] and publishes an online ''Journal of the Hakluyt Society''.

==American Friends of the Hakluyt Society==
A sister organisation, '''The American Friends of the Hakluyt Society''', was founded in 1996 at the [[John Carter Brown Library]] located on the campus of [[Brown University]]. The American Friends was founded in conjunction with the 150th anniversary celebration of the Hakluyt Society. The [[Rhode Island]] merchant [[John Carter Brown]] (1797–1874), was the first American to join the Society as a charter member in 1846.
 
The American Friends of the Hakluyt Society exists as a non-profit corporation with objectives similar to those of the Hakluyt Society in London, but with a focus on the history of the Americas. The group promotes and helps provide financial support from the United States for the publication of scholarly editions of records of voyages, travels and other geographical material of the past.

As described in the 9th century [[Zoroastrian]] text ''[[Dadestan-i Denig]]'' ("Religious Decisions"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe24/dd.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017102034/http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe24/dd.htm |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''hamistagan''''' or '''''{{lang|pal-Latn|hamēstagān}}''''' is a neutral place or state for the departed souls of those whose good deeds and bad deeds were equal in life. Here these souls await [[Judgment Day]]. Meanwhile, those who did mostly good experience bliss and those who did mostly evil suffer torment. ''Religious Decisions'' was written in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] (modern day [[Iran]]) when Islam was replacing Zoroastrianism as the majority religion.

Hamistagan can be compared to [[Roman Catholic]] [[purgatory]] because it occupies a position between [[heaven]] and [[hell]], but hamistagan is a place of waiting, not punishment and purification. As a neutral place, hamistagan is more like the Roman Catholic [[limbo]].

[[Islam]] does not have a similar neutral place where some await Judgment Day. The angels [[Nakir and Munkar]] interrogate a recently deceased soul, which then remains in its grave in a state of bliss or torment until Judgment Day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">The '''iCNxxx series''' is a range of [[automotive navigation system]]s from [[Navman]]. These include the iCN320, iCN330, iCN510, [[Navman iCN520|iCN520]], iCN530, iCN550, iCN610, iCN630, iCN635, and iCN650.

All the iCN products include address to address routing, [[Speech synthesis|spoken guidance instruction]]s and a 2-D display.

The 600 series do not have a battery, whereas the 300 and 500 series do.

Only the 500 series have a [[touch-screen]].

==Modding the iCN series==
The lack of regular software updates to the iCN 500 range inspired efforts to turn an obsolete single application [[personal navigation device]] into a multi functional [[Handheld PC]]. Once modded, an iCN is capable of running dozens of applications including Navman's main rivals in the GPS field: namely [[TomTom (company)|Tomtom Navigator v6]], [[Navigon]], Destinator, [[iGo (software)|iGo]] and Miomap.

Several methods exist for modding the iCN series, all of which involve simple software hacks.

Beyond running GPS alternatives such as Miomap 3.2, a modded iCN can run many PocketPC games.

For more information on modding the iCN series see the [http://navmanunlocked.forumwise.com/ navmanunlocked.forumwise.com] forum and [http://www.gpspassion.com/forumsen/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=35945&amp;whichpage=1 gpspassion.com]

'''ISO 3166-2:KP''' is the entry for [[North Korea]] (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for North Korea, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Nampo|1 metropolitan city]], [[province-level divisions of North Korea|1 capital city, 1 special city, and 9 provinces]]. All of them except the metropolitan city are province-level subdivisions. The three special administrative regions, i.e., the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]], the [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]], and the [[Sinuiju Special Administrative Region]], are not listed.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|KP}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of North Korea. The second part is two digits:
* 01: capital city
* 02&amp;ndash;10: provinces
* 13: special city
* 14: metropolitan city

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

The '''Italian Renaissance garden''' was a new style of garden which emerged in the late 15th century at villas in [[Rome]] and [[Florence]], inspired by classical ideals of order and beauty, and intended for the pleasure of the view of the garden and the landscape beyond, for contemplation, and for the enjoyment of the sights, sounds and smells of the garden itself.

In the late [[Renaissance]], the gardens became larger, grander and more symmetrical, and were filled with fountains, statues, [[grotto]]es, [[water organ]]s and other features designed to delight their owners and amuse and impress visitors. The style was imitated throughout [[Europe]], influencing the [[gardens of the French Renaissance]] and the [[English garden]].

== The classical influence on the Italian Renaissance garden ==

Prior to the [[Italian Renaissance]], Italian Medieval gardens were enclosed by walls, and were devoted to growing vegetables, fruits and medicinal herbs, or, in the case of monastery gardens, for silent meditation and prayer. The Italian Renaissance garden broke down the wall between the garden, the house, and the landscape outside.&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, Philippe. ''Histoire des Jardins,'' Editions Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance garden, like [[Renaissance art]] and [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], emerged from the rediscovery by Renaissance scholars of classical Roman models. They were inspired by the descriptions of ancient [[Roman gardens]] given by [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; by the letters of [[Pliny the Younger]], by [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''; and in ''Rerum Rusticanum'' by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], all of which gave detailed and lyrical description of the gardens of [[Roman villa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, Helen. ''Italian Gardens - A Cultural History'', 2006: 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny the Younger described his life at his villa at Laurentum: " ...a good life and a genuine one, which is happy and honourable, more rewarding than any "business" can be. You should take the first opportunity to leave the din, the futile bustle and useless occupations of the city and devote yourself to literature or to leisure."&lt;ref name="attlee13"&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a garden, according to Pliny, was "[[otium]]," which could be translated as seclusion, serenity, or relaxation, which was the opposite of the idea of  "negotium" that often classified busy urban life. A garden was a place to think, relax, and escape.&lt;ref name="attlee13"/&gt;

Pliny described shaded paths bordered with hedges, ornamental [[parterre]]s, fountains, and trees and bushes trimmed to geometric or fantastic shapes; all features which would become part of the future Renaissance garden.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, L'Art des jardins en Europe, Paris, 2006: 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alberti and the principles of the Renaissance Garden ==
The first Renaissance text to include garden design was ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' ('The Ten Books of Architecture'), by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472). He drew upon the architectural principles of [[Vitruvius]],&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and used quotations from [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] to describe what a garden should look like and how it should be used. He argued that a villa should both be looked at and a place to look from; that the house should be placed above the garden, where it could be seen and the owner could look down into the garden.&lt;ref name="attlee13"/&gt;
{{Renaissance}}
Alberti wrote: "The construction will give pleasure to the visitor if, when they leave the city, they see the villa in all its charm, as if to seduce and welcome the new arrivals. Toward this end, I would place it on a slightly elevated place. I would also have the road climb so gently that it fools those who take it to the point that they do not realize how high they have climbed until they discover the countryside below."&lt;ref  name="alberti"&gt;Alberti, Leon Battista. ''Édifices destinés aux catégories particulières de citoyens, in L'art d'édifier'', translated from the Latin by Pierre Caye and Françoise Choay, Book I, Paris, 2004: 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the garden, Alberti wrote: "...You should place [[portico]]s for giving shade, planters where vines can climb, placed on marble columns; vases and amusing statues, provided they are not obscene. You should also have rare plants.... Trees should be aligned and arranged evenly, each tree aligned with its neighbours."&lt;ref name="alberti"/&gt;

== The literary influence on the Italian Renaissance Garden ==
[[File:Appennino2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Apennine Colossus'' by Giambologna in the gardens of [[Villa di Pratolino]], about 1580]]
A popular romance, ''The [[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]],'' (''Poliphilo's Strife of Love in a Dream''), published in 1499 in [[Venice]] by the monk [[Francesco Colonna]], also had an important influence on the gardens of the Renaissance. It described the voyage and adventures of a traveller, Poliphile, through fantastic landscapes, looking for his love, Polia. The scenes described in the book and the accompanying [[woodcut]] illustrations influenced many Renaissance gardens; they included a lake-island (as at the [[Boboli Gardens]]), giants emerging from the earth (as at [[Villa di Pratolino]]), the [[labyrinth]], and the fountain of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (as at [[Villa di Castello]]) where Poliphile and Polia were reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;See Prevot,2005; Allain and Christiany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power and magnificence - the political symbolism of the Renaissance garden==
While the early Italian Renaissance gardens were designed for contemplation and pleasure with tunnels of greenery, trees for shade, an enclosed '' giardino segreto'' (secret garden) and fields for games and amusements, the [[House of Medici|Medici]], the ruling dynasty of Florence, used gardens to demonstrate their own power and [[Magnificence (history of ideas)|magnificence]]. "During the first half of the sixteenth century, magnificence came to be perceived as a princely virtue, and all over the Italian peninsula architects, sculptors, painters, poets, historians and humanist scholars were commissioned to concoct a magnificent image for their powerful patrons."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 28&lt;/ref&gt; The central fountain at Villa di Castello featured a statue of [[Hercules]] defeating [[Antaeus]], alluding to the triumph of the garden's builder, [[Cosimo de' Medici]]. over a faction of Florentine nobles who had tried to overthrow him. &lt;ref&gt; Isabella Ballerini, ''The Medici Villas: The Complete Guide,'' p. 33 &lt;/ref&gt; The garden was a form of political theater, presenting the power, wisdom, order, beauty and glory that the Medici had brought to Florence.

== Glossary of the Italian Renaissance Garden ==

== Gardens of the Early Italian Renaissance ==
=== The Medici Villa at Fiesole (1455-1461) ===
[[File:Villa Medici a Fiesole 1.jpg|thumb|Villa Medici in Fiesole.]]
The oldest existing Italian Renaissance garden is at the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]], north of Florence. It was created sometime between 1455 and 1461 by [[Giovanni de' Medici (1421–1463)]] the son of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], the founder of the Medici dynasty. Unlike other [[Medici villas|Medici family villas]] that were located on flat farmland, this villa was located on a rocky hillside with a view over Florence.

The Villa Medici followed Alberti's precepts that a villa should have a view 'that overlooks the city, the owner's land, the sea or a great plain, and familiar hills and mountains,' and that the foreground have 'the delicacy of gardens.'&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 14&lt;/ref&gt; The garden has two large terraces, one at the ground floor level and the other at the level of the first floor. From the reception rooms on the first floor, guests could go out to the [[loggia]] and from there to the garden so the loggia was a transition space connecting the interior with the exterior. Unlike later gardens, the Villa Medici did not have a grand staircase or other feature to link the two levels.

The garden was inherited by his nephew, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who made it a meeting place for poets, artists, writers and philosophers. In 1479, the poet [[Poliziano|Angelo Poliziano]], tutor to the Medici children, described the garden in a letter: "..Seated between the sloping sides of the mountains we have here water in abundance and being constantly refreshed with moderate winds find little inconvenience from the glare of the sun. As you approach the house it seems embosomed in the wood, but when you reach it you find it commands a full prospect of the city."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Palazzo Piccolomini at Pienza, Tuscany (1459)===
[[File:Piccolomini Gardens.JPG|thumb|Gardens of the Palazzo Piccolomini]]
The [[Pienza#Palazzo Piccolomini|Palazzo Piccolomini]] at [[Pienza]], was built by Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who was Pope from 1458 to 1464, under the name of [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]. He was a scholar of [[Latin]] and wrote extensively on education, astronomy and social culture.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 138&lt;/ref&gt; In 1459, he constructed a palace for himself and his Cardinals and court in his small native town of Pienza. Like the Villa Medici, a major feature of the house was the commanding view to be had from the loggia over the valley, the [[Val d'Orcia]], to the slopes of [[Mount Amiata]]. Closer to the house, there were terraces with geometric flowerbeds surrounding fountains and ornamented with bushes trimmed into cones and spheres similar to the garden of Pliny described in Alberti's ''De Re Aedificatoria''.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was designed to open to the town, the palace and the view.

===The Cortile del Belvedere in the Vatican Palace, Rome (1504-1513)===
{{Main|Cortile del Belvedere}}
In 1504, [[Pope Julius II]] commissioned the architect [[Donato Bramante]] to recreate a classical Roman pleasure garden in the space between the old papal [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] palace in Rome and the nearby Villa Belvedere. His model was the ancient sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at [[Palestrina]] or ancient Praeneste, and he used the classical ideals of proportion, symmetry and perspective in his design. He created a central axis to link the two buildings, and a series of terraces connected by double ramps, modelled after those at Palestrina. The terraces were divided into squares and rectangles by paths and flowerbeds, and served as an outdoor setting for Pope Julius's extraordinary collection of classical sculpture, which included the famous [[Laocoön]] and the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. A central [[exedra]] formed the dramatic conclusion of the long perspective up the courtyard, ramps and terraces.&lt;ref name="attlee21"/&gt;

The Venetian Ambassador described the [[Cortile del Belvedere]] in 1523: "One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange tree grows out of the pavement, of which there are a great many, arranged in perfect order....On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia."&lt;ref name="attlee21"&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the construction of the [[Vatican Library]] in the late 16th century across the centre of the ''cortile'' means that Bramante's design is now obscured but his ideas of proportion, symmetry and dramatic perspectives were used in many of the great gardens of the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Villa Madama, Rome (1516)===
[[File:Roma Villa Madama.jpg|thumb|Villa Madama (1516)]]
The [[Villa Madama]], situated on the slopes of [[Monte Mario]] and overlooking Rome, was begun by [[Pope Leo X]] and continued by Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]] (1478–1534). In 1516 Leo X gave the commission to [[Raphael]] who was at that time the most famous artist in Rome. Using the ancient text of ''De Architectura'' by Vitruvius and the writings of Pliny the Younger, Raphael imagined his own version of an ideal classical villa and garden. His villa had a great circular courtyard, and was divided into a winter apartment and a summer apartment. Passages led from the courtyard to the great loggia from which views could be gained of the garden and Rome. A round tower on the east side was intended as garden room in winter, warmed by the sun coming through glazed windows. The villa overlooked three terraces, one a square, one a circle, and one an oval. The top terrace was to be planted in chestnut trees and firs while the lower terrace was intended for plant beds.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the Villa Madama stopped in 1520, after the death of Raphael, but was then continued by other artists until 1534. They finished one-half of the villa including half of the circular courtyard, and the northwest loggia that was decorated with [[grotesque]] [[fresco]]es by [[Giulio Romano]] and [[stucco]] by [[Giovanni da Udine]]. Fine surviving features include a fountain of the head of an elephant by Giovanni da Udine and two gigantic stucco figures by [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Baccio Bandinelli]] at the entrance of the ''giardino segreto'', the secret garden.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 27&lt;/ref&gt; The villa is now a state guest house for the Government of Italy.

== Gardens of the High Renaissance ==

[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|Fountain of Diana, Villa d'Este]]

The middle of the 16th century saw the construction by the Medicis and other wealthy families and individuals, of a series of magnificent gardens that followed the principles of Alberti and Bramante; they were usually sited on a hilltop or slopes of a mountain; had a series of symmetrical terraces, one above the other, along a central axis; the house looked over the garden and landscape beyond and it could itself be seen from the bottom of the garden. Developments in hydrology meant that the gardens were equipped with increasingly elaborate and majestic cascades and fountains, and statues which recalled the grandeur of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa di Castello, Tuscany (1538)===
[[Villa di Castello]] was the project of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], first [[List of rulers of Tuscany|Duke of Tuscany]], begun when he was only seventeen. It was designed by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] who designed two other gardens: the [[Orto Botanico di Firenze|Giardino dei Semplici]] (1545) and the [[Boboli Gardens]] (1550) for Cosimo.

The garden was laid out on a gentle slope between the villa and the hill of [[Monte Morello]]. Tribolo first built a wall across the slope, dividing it into an upper garden filled with orange trees, and a lower garden that was subdivided into garden rooms with walls of hedges, rows of trees and tunnels of citrus trees and cedars. A central axis, articulated by a series of fountains, extended from the villa up to the base of Monte Morello. In this arrangement, the garden had both grand perspectives and enclosed, private spaces

The lower garden had a large marble fountain that was meant to be seen against a backdrop of dark cypresses, with figures of Hercules and [[Antaeus]]. Just above this fountain, in the centre of the garden, was a labyrinth formed by cypress, laurel, myrtle, roses, and box hedges. Concealed in the middle of the labyrinth was another fountain, with a statue of Venus. Around this fountain, Cosimo had bronze pipes installed under the tiles for ''giochi d'acqua'' ("water tricks"), which were concealed conduits which could be turned on with a key to drench unsuspecting guests. Another unusual feature was a [[tree house]] concealed in an ivy-covered oak tree, with a square dining room inside the tree.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 30&lt;/ref&gt;

At the far end of the garden and set against a wall, Tribolo created an elaborate grotto, decorated with mosaics, pebbles, sea shells, imitation stalactites, and niches with groups of statues of domestic and exotic animals and birds, many with real horns, antlers and tusks. The animals symbolized the virtues and accomplishments of past members of Medici family. Water flowed from the beaks, wings and claws of the animals into marble basins below each niche. A gate could close suddenly behind visitors, and they would be soaked by hidden fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the grotto, on the hillside, was small wood, or ''bosco'', with a pond in the center. In the pond is a bronze statue of a shivering giant, with cold water running down over his head, which represents either the month of January or the [[Apennine Mountains]].

When the last of the Medicis died in 1737, the garden began to be altered by its new owners, the [[House of Lorraine]]; the labyrinth was demolished and the statue of Venus was moved to the [[Villa La Petraia]]. But long before then, the garden had been described by many ambassadors and foreign visitors and had become famous throughout Europe. Its principles of perspective, proportion and symmetry, its geometric planting beds and rooms with walls of trees and hedges, were adapted in both the gardens of the [[French Renaissance]] and the [[garden à la française]] which followed.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa d'Este at Tivoli (1550-1572)===
The [[Villa d'Este]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] is one of the grandest and best-preserved of the Italian Renaissance gardens. It was created by Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]], son of [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]], the [[List of Dukes of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]], and [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. He was made a Cardinal at the age of twenty-nine and became governor of Tivoli in 1550. To develop his residence, he took over a former [[Franciscan]] convent, and for the garden he bought the adjoining steep hillside and the valley below. His chosen architect was [[Pirro Ligorio]], who had been carrying out excavations for Ippolito at the nearby ruins of the ancient ''Villa Adriana'', or [[Hadrian's Villa]], the extensive country residence of the [[Roman Emperor]], [[Hadrian]], that had numerous elaborate water features.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligorio created the garden as a series of terraces descending the steep hillside at the edge of the mountains overlooking the plain of [[Latium]]. The terraces were connected by gates and grand stairways starting from a terrace below the villa and traversing down to the Fountain of Dragons at the foot of the garden. The stairway was crossed by five traversal alleys on the different levels, which were divided into rooms by hedges and trellises covered with vines. At the crossing points of the stairway and the alleys there were pavilions, fruit trees, and aromatic plants. At the top, the promenade used by the Cardinal passed below the villa and led in one direction to the grotto of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and in the other to the grotto of [[Asclepius]].

The glory of the Villa d'Este was the system of fountains, fed by two aqueducts that Ligorio constructed from the River [[Aniene]]. In the centre of the garden, the alley of one hundred fountains (which actually had two hundred fountains), crossed the hillside, connecting the Oval Fountain with the Fountain of Rome, which was decorated with models of the famous landmarks of Rome. On a lower level, another alley passed by the Fountain of Dragons and joined the Fountain of [[Proserpina]] with the Fountain of the Owl. Still lower, an alley of fishponds connected the Fountain of the Organ to the site of a proposed Fountain of Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;The present Fountain of Neptune was built in 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Each fountain and path told a story, linking the d'Este family to the legends of Hercules and [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] or ''Ippolito'', the mythical son of [[Theseus]] and [[Hippolyta]], the Queen of the [[Amazons]]. The central axis led to the Fountain of Dragons, which illustrated one of the [[labours of Hercules]], and three other statues of Hercules were found in the garden. The myth of Ippolito, the mythical namesake of the owner, was illustrated by two grottos, that of Asclepius and Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds but the most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher [[Michel de Montaigne]], who visited the garden in 1580: "The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created...made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water ...&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, M. E.. de, ''Journal de voyage en Italie'', Le Livre de poche, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was substantially changed after the death of the Cardinal and in the 17th century, and many statues were sold, but the basic features remain, and the Organ Fountain has recently been restored and plays music once again.

== Mannerism and the gardens of the Late Renaissance ==
Mannerism was a style which developed in painting in the 1520s, which defied the traditional rules of Renaissance painting. "Mannerist paintings were intensely stylish, polished and complex, their composition bizarre, the subject matter fantastic."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This also describes other mannerist gardens which appeared beginning about 1560.

===Villa della Torre (1559)===
The Villa della Tore, built for [[Giulio della Torre]] (1480–1563), a law professor and humanist scholar in [[Verona]], was a parody of the classical rules of Vitruvius; the [[peristyle]] of the building was in the perfectly harmonious Vitruvius style, but some of the stones were rough-cut and of different sizes and decorated with masks which sprayed water, which jarred the classical harmony. "The building was deformed: it seemed to be caught in a strange, amorphous condition, somewhere crude rustic simplicity and classical perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The fireplaces inside were in the forms of the mouths of gigantic masks. Outside, the garden was filled with disturbing architectural elements, including a grotto whose entrance represented the mouth of hell, with eyes that showed fires burning inside.

=== Sacro Bosco at Bomarzo, Lazio (1552-1584) ===
[[File:Bomarzo parco mostri orco.jpg|thumb|Sacro Bosco, the ogre at the mouth of hell (1552-1584)]]
The [[Park of the Monsters|Sacro Bosco]], or "Sacred Wood," was the most famous and extravagant of the Mannerist gardens. It was created for [[Pier Francesco Orsini]] (1523–84) near the village of [[Bomarzo]]. It was witty and irreverent, and violated all the rules of Renaissance gardens; it had no symmetry, no order, and no focal point. An inscription in the garden said: "You who have travelled the world in search of great and stupendous marvels, come here, where there are horrendous faces, elephants, lions, ogres and dragons."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Attlee, 2006: 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was filled with enormous statues, reached by wandering paths. It included a mouth of hell, a house that seemed to be falling over, fantastic animals and figures, many of them carved of rough volcanic rock in place in the garden. Some of the scenes were taken from the romantic epic poem [[Orlando Furioso]] by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], others from works by [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Petrarch|Francesco Petrarch]]. As one inscription in the garden notes, the ''Sacro Bosco'' "resembles only itself, and nothing else." &lt;ref&gt;Cited by Attlee, 2006: 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first botanical gardens==
[[File:Orto dei semplici PD 01.jpg|thumb|The Botanical Gardens of Padua (1543), from a contemporary engraving in the Basilica di Sant'Antonio.]]
The Italian Renaissance also saw a revolution in the study of [[botany]] through the systematic classification of plants and the creation of the first [[botanical garden]]s. During the [[Middle Ages]], plants were studied for the medicinal uses. Until the 16th century, the standard work on botany was ''[[Materia medica|De Materia Medica]]'' written in the 1st century AD by a Greek physician, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], that described six hundred plants but lacked many of the native plants of Italy and had vague descriptions with stylized and inexact illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1533, the [[University of Padua]] created the first chair of botany and appointed Francesco Bonafede as the first ''Professor Simplicium''- professor of 'simples,' or medicinal plants. In 1545, a scholar from the medical school of the University of Padua, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], wrote a new book on [[herbalism|medicinal herbs]], ''Commentarii in libros sex Pedanii Dioscoridis'', which, in successive editions, systematically described and gave the medicinal uses of twelve hundred different plants. Such scientific work was aided by sailors and explorers returning from the [[New World]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], who brought back samples of plants unknown in Europe.

In June 1543, the University of Padua created the world's first botanical garden, the [[Orto botanico di Padova]], and the [[University of Pisa]] followed with its own garden, the [[Orto botanico di Pisa]], in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 46. The University of Pisa claims that its botanical garden was founded in 1543 and that of Padua, the Orto botanico di Padova, was founded in 1545, giving them the oldest garden, but according to Helena Attlee, the claim of Padua is better documented in the archives of the [[Republic of Venice]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1591, the garden at [[Padua]] had over 1,168 different plants and trees, including a [[fan palm]] tree brought from [[Egypt]]. In 1545, in Florence, Cosimo de' Medici founded the ''Giardino dei Semplici'', the garden of medicinal herbs. Soon the medical schools of the universities of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[University of Ferrara|Ferrara]] and [[University of Sassari|Sassari]] all had their own botanical gardens filled with exotic plants from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karakoram''', or '''Karakorum''' is a large mountain range spanning the borders of [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and [[China]], with the northwest extremity of the range extending to [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].  It begins in the [[Wakhan Corridor]] (Afghanistan) in the west and encompasses the majority of [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] (Pakistan) and extends into [[Ladakh]] (India), and the disputed [[Aksai Chin]] region controlled by China. It is the [[Greater Ranges|second highest mountain range]] in the world, and part of the complex of ranges including the [[Pamir Mountains]], the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Himalayan Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312055/Karakoram-Range |title=Karakoram Range |last1= Bessarabov |first1=Georgy Dmitriyevich |date=7 February 2014 |website= |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icimod.org/?q=1137 |title=Hindu Kush Himalayan Region |publisher= ICIMOD |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; .  The Karakoram has eight summits over 7,500m height, with four of them exceeding 8000m:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shukurov, The Natural Environment of Central and South Asia|2005|p=512}}; {{cite web |title=The Eight-Thousanders |last1=Voiland |first1=Adam |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |date=2013 |website=Nasa Earth Observatory |publisher= |access-date=23 December 2016}}; BBC, ''Planet Earth'', "Mountains", Part Three&lt;/ref&gt; [[K2]], the second highest peak in the world at {{convert|8611|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, [[Gasherbrum I]], [[Broad Peak]] and [[Gasherbrum II]].

The range is about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length, and is the most heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] part of the world outside the polar regions. The [[Siachen Glacier]] at {{convert|76|km|mi}} and the [[Biafo Glacier]] at {{convert|63|km|mi}} rank as the world's second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions.&lt;ref name="Measurements"&gt;Tajikistan's Fedchenko Glacier is {{convert|77|km|mi}} long.  Baltoro and Batura Glaciers in the Karakoram are {{convert|57|km|mi}} long, as is Bruggen or Pio XI Glacier in southern Chile. Measurements are from recent imagery, generally supplemented with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping as well as Jerzy Wala,''Orographical Sketch Map: Karakoram:  Sheets 1 &amp; 2'', Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karakoram is bounded on the east by the [[Aksai Chin]] plateau, on the northeast by the edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and on the north by the river valleys of the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]] and [[Karakash River|Karakash]] rivers beyond which lie the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. At the northwest corner are the [[Pamir Mountains]]. The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed, west to east, by the [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]], [[Indus River|Indus]], and [[Shyok River]]s, which separate the range from the northwestern end of the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]] range proper. These rivers flow northwest before making an abrupt turn southwestward towards the plains of [[Pakistan]]. Roughly in the middle of the Karakoram range is the [[Karakoram Pass]], which was part of a historic trade route between [[Ladakh]] and [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] but now inactive.

The [[Tashkurghan National Nature Reserve]] and the [[Pamir Wetlands National Nature Reserve]] in the Karalorun and Pamir mountains have been nominated for inclusion in [[UNESCO]] in 2010 by the National Commission of the People's Republic of China for UNESCO and has tentatively been added to the list.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Karakorum-Pamir|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5535/|publisher=unesco|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
[[File:Biafo Glacier, Gilgit Region.jpg|thumb|"Karakoram" is a Turkic word referencing the mountains' black gravel, as seen near [[Pakistan]]'s [[Biafo Glacier]].]]
Karakoram is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] term meaning ''black gravel''. The Central Asian traders originally applied the name to the [[Karakoram Pass]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Mason (geographer) |title=Exploration of the Shaksgam Valley and Aghil ranges, 1926 |publisher=|year=1928 |location=|page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrbVqD06aXYC |isbn=9788120617940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early European travellers, including [[William Moorcroft (explorer)|William Moorcroft]] and [[George W. Hayward|George Hayward]], started using the term for the range of mountains west of the pass, although they also used the term '''Muztagh''' (meaning, "Ice Mountain") for the range now known as Karakoram.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nomenclature in the Karakoram: Discussion  |vauthors=Close C, Burrard S, Younghusband F, etal |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=76 |issue=2 |year=1930 |pages=148–158 |doi=10.2307/1783980 |jstor=1783980 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later terminology was influenced by the [[Great Trigonometric Survey of India|Survey of India]], whose surveyor [[Thomas Montgomerie]] in the 1850s gave the labels K1 to K6 (K for Karakoram) to six high mountains visible from his station at [[Mount Haramukh]] in [[Kashmir]].

In ancient Sanskrit texts ([[Puranas]]), the name '''Krishnagiri''' (black mountains) was used to describe the range.&lt;ref name="RazaAhmad1978"&gt;{{citation |last1=Raza |first1=Moonis |last2=Ahmad |first2=Aijazuddin |last3=Mohammad |first3=Ali |title=The Valley of Kashmir: The land |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQ08AAAAMAAJ |year=1978 |publisher=Vikas Pub.

== Exploration ==
Due to its altitude and ruggedness, the Karakoram is much less inhabited than parts of the Himalayas further east.  European explorers first visited early in the 19th century, followed by [[Great Trigonometrical Survey|British surveyors]] starting in 1856.

The [[Muztagh Pass]] was crossed in 1887 by the expedition of Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick French|French, Patrick]]. (1994). ''Younghusband: The Last Great Imperial Adventurer'', pp. 53, 56-60. HarperCollins''Publishers'', London. Reprint (1995): Flamingo. London. {{ISBN|0-00-637601-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the valleys above the [[Hunza River]] were explored by General Sir [[George K. Cockerill]] in 1892.  Explorations in the 1910s and 1920s established most of the geography of the region.

The name Karakoram was used in the early 20th century, for example by [[Kenneth Mason (geographer)|Kenneth Mason]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; for the range now known as the [[Baltoro Muztagh]].  The term is now used to refer to the entire range from the [[Batura Muztagh]] above [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] in the west to the [[Saser Muztagh]] in the bend of the [[Shyok River]] in the east.

Floral surveys were carried out in the Shyok River catchment and from Panamik to Turtuk village by [[Chandra Prakash Kala]] during 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indigenous Uses, Population Density, and Conservation of Threatened Medicinal Plants in Protected Areas of the Indian Himalayas|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=368–378|year=2005|first=Chandra Prakash|last=Kala|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00602.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Health traditions of Buddhist community and role of amchis in trans-Himalayan region of India|journal=Current Science|volume=89|number=8|year=2005|page=1331|url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/oct252005/1331.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and glaciers==
&lt;!-- Commented out for now
[[File:Karakoram location map.png|thumb|[[Cartographic relief depiction|Relief map]] of the Karakoram]] --&gt;
The Karakoram is in one of the world's most geologically  active areas, at the [[Geology of the Himalaya|plate boundary between the Indo-Australian plate and the Eurasian plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle, Michael P., Geological evolution of the Karakoram Ranges, Ital.J.Geosci, (Boll.Soc.Geo.It.), Vol. 130, No. 2 (2011), pp. 147-159, 5 figs. (DOI: 10.3301/IJG.2011.08)&lt;/ref&gt;
A significant part, 28-50% of the Karakoram Range is glaciated, compared to the Himalaya (8-12%) and [[Alps]] (2.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gansser|year=1975|title=Geology of the Himalayas|publisher=Interscience Publishers|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountain [[glacier]]s may serve as an indicator of climate change, advancing and receding with long-term changes in temperature and precipitation. The Karakoram glaciers are slightly retreating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110124162708.htm |title=Debris on certain Himalayan glaciers may prevent melting |first= Gail |last=Gallessich |work=sciencedaily.com |year=2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716304138|title=Changes in the ablation zones of glaciers in the western Himalaya and the Karakoram between 1972 and 2015 |first=Sher |last=Muhammad| publisher=Remote Sensing of Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-15|title=Changes in the ablation zones of glaciers in the western Himalaya and the Karakoram between 1972 and 2015|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716304138|journal=Remote Sensing of Environment|language=en|volume=187|pages=505–512|doi=10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.034|issn=0034-4257}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the Himalayas where glaciers are losing mass at significantly higher rate, many Karakoram glaciers are covered in a layer of rubble which insulates the ice from the warmth of the sun.  Where there is no such insulation, the rate of retreat is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Remote sensing approach for monitoring debris-covered glaciers in the high altitude Karakoram Himalayas|first=B.K.|last=Veettil|journal=International Journal of Geomatics and Geosciences|year=2012|volume=2|pages=833–841|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Karakoram during the Ice Age===
In the last [[ice age]], a [[ice cap|connected series of glaciers]] stretched from western [[Tibet]] to [[Nanga Parbat]], and from the [[Tarim basin]] to the [[Gilgit District]].&lt;ref name=K1988&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1988|title=The Pleistocene Glaciation of Tibet and the Onset of Ice Ages- An Autocycle Hypothesis.Tibet and High Asia.

While the current valley glaciers in the Karakoram reach a maximum length of {{convert|76|km|mi}}, several of the ice-age valley glacier branches and main valley glaciers, had lengths up to {{convert|700|km|mi}}. During the Ice Age, the glacier snowline was about {{Convert|1300|m|ft}} lower than today.&lt;ref name=K2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=K2001/&gt;

==Subranges==
[[File:Karakoram Range.jpg|right|200px|thumb|View of the moon over Karakoram Range in Pakistan]]
The naming and division of the various subranges of the Karakoram is not universally agreed upon. However, the following is a list of the most important subranges, following Jerzy Wala.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Wala, ''Orographical Sketch Map of the Karakoram'', Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The ranges are listed roughly west to east.

* [[Batura Muztagh]]
* [[Rakaposhi-Haramosh Mountains]]
* [[Spantik-Sosbun Mountains]]
* [[Hispar Muztagh]]
* [[South Ghujerab Mountains]]
* [[Panmah Muztagh]]
* [[Wesm Mountains]]
* [[Masherbrum Mountains]]
* [[Baltoro Muztagh]]
* [[Saltoro Mountains]]
* [[Siachen Muztagh]]
* [[Rimo Muztagh]]
* [[Saser Muztagh]]

== Passes ==
[[File:Chinese and Pakistan border guards at Khunjerab Pass IMG 7721 Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Pakistani border guards at [[Khunjerab Pass]]]]
From west to east
*[[Kilik Pass]]
*[[Mintaka Pass]]
*[[Khunjerab Pass]] (the highest paved international border crossing at {{convert|4693|m|ft|abbr=on}})
*[[Shimshal]] Pass
*[[Mustagh Pass]]
*[[Karakoram Pass]]
*[[Sasser Pass]]

The Khunjerab Pass is the only motorable pass across the range.  The Shimshal Pass (which does not cross an international border) is the only other pass still in regular use.

==Cultural references==
The Karakoram mountain range has been referred to in a number of [[novels]] and movies. [[Rudyard Kipling]] refers to the Karakoram mountain range in his novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'', which was first published in 1900. [[Marcel Ichac]] made a film titled ''Karakoram'', chronicling a French expedition to the range in 1936. The film won the Silver Lion at the [[Venice Film Festival]] of 1937. [[Greg Mortenson]] details the Karakoram, and specifically K2 and the [[Balti people|Balti]], extensively in his book ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]'', about his quest to build schools for children in the region. In the ''[[Gatchaman]]'' TV series, the Karakoram range houses Galactor's headquarters. ''K2 Kahani'' (The K2 Story) by [[Mustansar Hussain Tarar]] describes his experiences at K2 base camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tarar |first=Mustansar Hussain |date=1994 |title=K2 kahani |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL18941738M/K2_kahani |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel (published in Urdu)|pages=179 |isbn=9693505239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">This is a list of flags used in '''[[Southern Rhodesia]]''' between 1890 and 1964 and '''[[Rhodesia]]''' between 1964 and 1979.  The evolution of Southern Rhodesia from a British South African Company concern, to a British Colony, then to a member of a Federal Government, then to a self-declared state is evident by the different flags used.

For flags after these dates see [[Flags of Zimbabwe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73775">The '''list of [[drainage basin]]s by area''' identifies basins (also known as watersheds or catchments), sorted by area, which drain to [[ocean]]s, [[mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean sea]]s, rivers, lakes and other water bodies. All basins larger than {{convert|400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} are included as well as selected smaller basins. It includes drainage basins which do not flow to the ocean ([[endorheic basin]]s). It includes oceanic sea drainage basins which have hydrologically coherent areas (oceanic seas are [[International Hydrographic Organization|set by IHO convention]]).

The oceans drain approximately 83% of the land in the world. The other 17% – an area larger than the basin of the Arctic Ocean – drains to internal endorheic basins.

Note that there are substantial areas of the world that do not "drain" in the commonly understood sense. In Arctic deserts much of the snowfall sublimates directly into the air and does not melt into flowing water, while in equatorial deserts precipitation may evaporate before joining any substantial water course. However, these areas can still be included in topographically defined basins if one considers the hypothetical flow of water (or ice), and thus nutrients or pollutants, over the surface of the ground (or ice sheet); this is the approach taken here. For example, the Antarctic ice sheet can be divided into basins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/divide/poster/background1.gif ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715185837/http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/divide/poster/background1.gif |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of Libya is included in the Mediterranean Sea basin even though almost no water from the interior actually reaches the sea.

[[File:Percival Harrison Fawcett.jpg|thumb|The British surveyor [[Percy Fawcett]] in 1911, who believed an indigenous city, which he called "the Lost City of Z", had existed in the Brazilian jungle.]]
The '''Lost City of Z''' is the name given by [[Percy Fawcett|Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] surveyor, to an indigenous city that he believed had existed in the jungle of the [[Mato Grosso]] state of [[Brazil]]. Based on early histories of South America and his own explorations of the [[Amazon River]] region, Fawcett theorized that a complex civilization once existed there, and that isolated ruins may have survived.&lt;ref name="Grann NYer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grann|first=David|author-link=David Grann|date=September 19, 2005|title=The Lost City of Z|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/the-lost-city-of-z|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|volume=LXXXI|issue=28|pages=56–81|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fawcett found a document known as {{Interlanguage link|Manuscript 512|pt|Manuscrito 512}}, held at the [[National Library of Brazil]], believed to have been written by Portuguese ''[[bandeirante]]'', João da Silva Guimarães. Da Silva wrote that during 1753, he had discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with [[hieroglyphics]]. He described the city ruins in great detail without giving its location.

''Manuscript 512'' was written after explorations made in the [[sertão]] of the province of [[Bahia]].{{efn-lr|name="expl"|group="n"|See Fawcett's book ''Exploration Fawcett'' (1953).}} Fawcett intended to pursue finding this city as a secondary goal after "Z". He was preparing an expedition to find "Z" when [[World War I]] broke out and the British government suspended its support (Fawcett returned to Britain and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the war). In 1920, Fawcett undertook a personal expedition to find the city, but withdrew after suffering a fever and having to shoot his pack animal.&lt;ref name="Grann NYer" /&gt; On a second expedition five years later, Fawcett, his son Jack, and Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell, disappeared in the Mato Grosso jungle.

==Possible influences on Fawcett==
Researchers believe that Fawcett may have been influenced in his thinking by information he might have obtained from indigenous people about the [[archaeological]] site of [[Kuhikugu]], near the headwaters of the [[Xingu River]].&lt;ref name="Grann book"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Grann|authorlink=David Grann|date=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|publisher=Doubleday|year=|location=|pages=|title-link=The Lost City of Z (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhikugu was discovered by Westerners after Fawcett's presumed death in the jungle in 1925. The site contains the ruins of an estimated twenty towns and villages in which as many as 50,000 people might once have lived.

== In popular culture ==
In 2005, the American journalist [[David Grann]] published an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on Fawcett's expeditions and findings, called "The Lost City of Z".&lt;ref name="Grann NYer" /&gt; In 2009, he developed it into a [[The Lost City of Z (book)|book of the same title]], and in 2016, it was adapted by writer-director [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]] into a [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film also of the same name]] starring [[Charlie Hunnam]], [[Robert Pattinson]], and [[Sienna Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/james-grays-the-lost-city-of-z-starts-shooting-marvels-spider-man-tom-holland-joins-the-cast-20150819|title=James Gray's 'The Lost City Of Z' Starts Shooting, Marvel's Spider-Man Tom Holland Joins The Cast|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|date=August 19, 2015|website=IndieWire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 video game ''[[Shadow of the Tomb Raider]]'', [[Lara Croft]] uncovers relics of Fawcett's final doomed search of the Lost City considerably farther west in [[Peru]].

== Recent development ==
The discovery of large geometrical earthworks in interfluvial settings of southern Amazonia support Fawcett’s theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7|title=Pre-Columbian earth-builders settled along the entire southern rim of the Amazon|last=Jonas Gregorio de Souza et. al|date=March 27, 2018|website=Nature.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Ian Yeabsley''' (born 1972) is an English former [[first-class cricket]]er.

Son of former [[Devon County Cricket Club|Devon]] player, [[Doug Yeabsley]], and brother of fellow first-class player [[Richard Yeabsley|Richard]], Yeabsley was educated at [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]] and [[Queen's College, Cambridge]]. During his brief cricket career, he was an [[off-break]] bowler. He represented [[Cambridge University]], playing just two first-class matches (both in 1995), taking two wickets at a cost of 42 runs each. After university, he became a Geography teacher, teaching at Haberdashers' for 11 years, before becoming Head of Geography and, initially, Master in Charge of Cricket at [[Aldenham School]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/bainespsa/docs/a31822_haberaske_skylark_2008/120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aldenham.com/award-for-leading-all-rounder-in-schools-cricket/&lt;/ref&gt; A House Master, Yeabsley lives in the school with his wife and seven children.&lt;ref&gt;http://aldenham.com/boarding-and-flexi-boarding/the-house-system/mcgills/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge to|Scotts Miracle-Gro Company |date=December 2017 }}
'''Miracle-Gro''' usually refers to a plant food brand made by [[Scotts Miracle-Gro Company]].  It is commonly used in gardens and houseplants because Miracle-Gro provides nutrients to plants that are otherwise depleted from the soil over time. This allows plants fed with Miracle-Gro to grow faster than unfertilized plants because Miracle-Gro provides readily available material for plants to use in the production of new plant cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/flowering-plants/question181.htm | title = What is fertilizer and why do plants need it? | publisher = howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main components of this fertilizer is nitrogen derived from ammonium and nitrates. Miracle-Gro fertilizers come in different ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Miracle-Gro for flowers has a 15-30-15 ratio, meaning that there is 15% nitrogen, 30% phosphorus, and 15% potassium by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://njaes.rutgers.edu/horsepastures/soil_fertility.htm | title = Soil Fertility for Horse Pasture Management | publisher = New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Miracle-Gro was developed and launched by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in the late 1940s.  Hagedorn created the product brand name and its distinctive package design. Horace Hagedorn died in 2006, just short of his 90th birthday. Otto Stern, the co-founder, was the uncle of noted historian Fritz Stern. In "The Five Germanys I Have Known," Fritz Stern mentions his very rich uncle Otto who had invented Miracle-Gro.

Miracle-Gro has several different fertilizer mixes which include:

All Purpose (24-8-16), Rose (18-24-16), Flowers (15-30-15), Trees &amp; Shrubs (15-10-9) and Tomato (18-18-21). Note, these values are based on water-soluble dry mix or tree spikes, not on ready to feed fertilizer values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productCategoryLanding.jsp?navAction=jump&amp;itemId=cat50010&amp;id=cat50106 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928115811/http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productCategoryLanding.jsp?navAction=jump&amp;itemId=cat50010&amp;id=cat50106 |archive-date=2008-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miracle-Gro also makes a variety of products including hose feeders, soils, and weed controls.

'''Mobile local search''' is a technology that lets people [[search engine|search]] for local things using mobile equipment such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[PDA]]s, and other mobile devices. Mobile local search satisfies the need to offer a mobile subscriber spontaneous access to near-position services and information such as businesses, products, events, restaurant, movie theatre or other local information.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Mobile local search is the search and discovery of persons, places, and things within an identifiable space defined by distinct parameters.  These parameters are evolving.  Today they include social networks, individuals, cities, neighborhoods, landmarks, and actions that are relevant to the searcher’s past, current, and future location.  These parameters provide structure to vertically deep and horizontally broad data categories that can stand-alone or are combined to comprise searchable directories.&lt;ref name= "qr10"/&gt;

Mobile local search is usually based on organized directories accessed through specialized search tools, rather than the web, although mobile local search often provides links to mobile ([[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]) web sites. It is also an application of a [[location-based service]].

== Technology ==
Mobile local search involves in some cases [[GPS tracking]], which, without prior consent, may cause privacy concerns. Furthermore, recent surveys expect merely 10% of mobile devices worldwide to be equipped with GPS chips in 2011.

Alternatively, mobile local search can also be done without mobile operators and GPS systems involved. This is possible through access to the [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] protocol, which mobile operators have. However, having access via the mobile operator is very hard since the mobile operators sell it at a premium rate, if at all.

Although GPS-enabled devices are not prevalent yet, industry experts show that consumers are demanding mobile local search now, with an expected growth of 91% from 2007 to 2011. As a consequence, there is a gap in this opportunity that can be cleverly addressed by mobile operators and service providers with access to the [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] layer.

== Access methods ==

Mobile local search may be screen-based using the keypad and display on the mobile device, or voice-based using spoken commands that are interpreted by a [[speech recognition]] application.

'''Screen-based''' search using the keypad to enter search terms into a form on the mobile screen is the most common access method today.  It has the advantages of working in a noisy environment and avoiding speech interpretation problems.  But the user has to enter search terms using a small keypad typical of most mobile devices, with results displayed on a small screen.  Screen-based search may be awkward for people with coordination or vision handicaps.

Screen-based search may be supported by a specialized application such as [[where.com]] running on the handset, by an SMS short code,  or by a [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] or [[XHTML Mobile Profile|XHTML-MP]] website page on a remote server displayed by the handset browser.  Although most search tools today are based on handset software, the trend seems to be towards web-based services.

Also, when the consumer receives a reply to his search request, the most common way of delivery is via [[SMS]].

'''Voice-based''' search is becoming viable due to advances in [[speech recognition]] technology.  It is useful for people who have difficulty using the small keypad, or who need to get information while driving.  Spoken prompts guide the users through the local directory to find an entry.  The service may include fallback to a live operator if the speech technology has difficulty understanding what they are looking for, or a 'silent agent' may assist the speech recognition software.

Results may be spoken and/or delivered to the handset in [[SMS]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] format, where they may be stored for future reference.

Most often, voice-based search uses the voice channel to deliver the caller's utterance to a server-based search application.  In some cases, a small application on the mobile device undertakes the first part of speech recognition, breaking down the utterance into a series of elementary components or '[[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]', and then sending the phones over the data channel to a server application.

'''Multimedia-based''' search will be prevalent as a hybrid form of both "voice-based" and "screen-based" search that will establish a time-memory tradeoff in the implementation process of fast-evolving mobile equipment.

== Types of information ==

Mobile search content may include more location-based and more street-smart information on businesses, products, services, events, human relations and other local specifics,which require immediacy and spontaneity. Besides, the location-based content may be formulated by accumulative data mining on consumer behaviors and whereabouts, which may trigger privacy concerns,commercial come-ons and, if necessary, some legislative justifications.

A search for '''businesses''' is the mobile equivalent of the printed Yellow Pages, but the search may focus on a small geographical area.  For example, the caller may be looking for a nearby pharmacy or restaurant, or may want a local [[pizza delivery]].  The more advanced local search tools will vary the search radius depending on the type of business and the density of this type of business in the local area.  For example, a caller looking for a coffee shop will probably want one within walking distance.  If they are looking for a home furniture store they will expect to travel further.  If they want a taxi, distance is not important: the taxi will come to them.

A search for '''products''' is more specific than a search for businesses.  The user is looking for a particular product and wants to find a local business that stocks this product.

A full-function mobile local search service will go much further, particularly as smartphone penetration increases.  For example, mobile users may want to find where a particular movie is playing, what restaurants are near the cinema, read reviews about those restaurants, and book reservations or buy movie tickets.  They may want to hear about traffic conditions, the score from the local football game, the winning lottery number or where to go to vote.

== Differences from Web search ==
As opposed to Web search, mobile local search requires more immediacy and street-smart knowledge and information, local events and driving directions. The technical difference from web-based search is that, whether using the keypad or voice commands, the caller has limited 'bandwidth'.  They do not want to hear or scroll through long lists of results.  They want to "quickly and unobtrusively" zero in on the type of local information they are looking for, due to privacy, safety and time pressure.

Some of the advancements by the major portals in Internet search, such as Google's famous page-ranking scheme, do not apply in the wireless world since people are not searching for Web sites as much as answers to specific questions. 2006 showed a significant movement to the question-answer model.  In this model answers are sent in reply to directory service queries similar to the nature of conventional 411 operators. [[AskMeNow]], [[Ask.com]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing.com]] all made efforts in this regard.

== Business models ==

Mobile local search services are usually provided today by mobile carriers, directory enquiry providers, mobile messaging operators or Yellow Pages publishers.  Behind these outlets, there is a growing network of agencies, distributors and software providers, some of whom are now starting to offer service direct to the public. Search giants, like Yahoo and Google, and big web publishers, such as Amazon.con and eBay have already embarked on this potentially lucrative market segment.

The services are provided through a caller-pays, advertiser-pays or hybrid business model.

In a '''caller-pays''' model, as with voice-based directory enquiry services, the caller pays each time they access the service.  Caller-pays voice-based local mobile search services are common outside North America, but have been slow to emerge in the USA due to regulatory restrictions.

In an '''advertiser-pays''' model, standard for screen-based search and starting to emerge with voice-based 'Free DA' services in North America, businesses pay to be placed early in the list of results, or pay each time a caller chooses to connect through.

In '''hybrid''' models, advertising revenue lets the service provider offer reduced rates.

As with TV, magazines and other media, mobile local search services will most likely continue to be offered under all three models, but the hybrid model may predominate.  That is, callers will probably accept a limited amount of advertising (which they may actually find useful) in exchange for reduced prices, but may be less willing to use a free service where they are bombarded with advertising.

The value to an advertiser will vary depending on their type of business, and may range from a dollar or less for a taxi or sandwich shop to well over ten dollars for a real-estate broker, attorney or [[debt consolidation]] service.  Consultants forecast that the global industry will grow to over US$1 billion by 2010.

== Service providers ==
{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
The most direct way to find more about what is happening in the MoLo space is to check out the websites of the MoLo service providers and see what they are offering.  There are many of them.  Almost all mobile carriers have mobile local search offerings, including [[Verizon Wireless]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Vodafone]], [[T-Mobile]], [[Sprint Nextel]], [[Orange SA]] and so on.

Many Directory Assistance providers also offer mobile local search, including free DA providers [[Jingle Networks]] and 1-800-San-Diego in the USA, [[118 118 (Sweden)|118 118]], [[Yell Group]], Pages Jaunes, [[Seat Pagine Gialle]], [[Eniro]] etc. in Europe, and many others.  One of the more fully functional services is provided by Contact Center Americas  in Colombia.

The [[Yellow Pages Group]] in Canada provides one of the first voice-enabled local search services.

In [[climatic geomorphology]] '''morphoclimatic zones''' are areas which are characterised by [[landform]]s associated with a particular climate. The geomorphological processes involved with distinct climates can have large impacts on the near-surface geology of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Fookes, P. G., Baynes, F. and Hutchinson, J. N. (2000).

Land exploration and surveying has played a crucial role in the development of Queensland. Surveyors and cartographers played an active part in establishing Queensland's borders, physically surveying the land as well as creating maps, survey plans and registers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|title=Collections and services|last=|first=|date=21 September 2018|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003192050/https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|archive-date=4 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical input of the surveying and mapping industry to the development of Queensland is an important factor in the role the department plays in providing a valuable resource for a wide range of community interests and government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its short history the museum has established a comprehensive collection, housing many important maps, survey plans and artefacts, significant to the history of mapping, surveying and land development particularly in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The museum acquires, preserves, catalogues and displays information and artefacts pertaining to historical land settlement, surveying and cartographic activities in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Collection strategy ===
The museum aims to identify records, artefacts, maps and plans that are useful in filling gaps in the knowledge about the history of mapping and surveying in Queensland, and make such knowledge accessible. New material is constantly being identified as important for research purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical collections ==
Our physical and digital collections include:

* historical maps and plans
* historical photographs
* aerial photography
* artefacts
* biographies of surveyors and cartographers
* documents (e.g. early Queensland Treasury rental sheets)
* publications.

== History ==
In 1982, the [[Queensland Government]] through the [[Surveyor General of Queensland]], JM Serisier ordered that a mapping and surveying museum be set up in order to preserve the mapping and surveying history of Queensland. The original museum was established in the [[Land Administration Building|Lands Administration Building]], (now the Conrad Treasury Hotel), and Bill Kitson was tasked with establishing and operating the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the support of the department and the mapping and surveying industry Kitson set about collecting artefacts, which were rapidly disappearing as technology overtook the traditional means of creating maps and surveys. The museum’s collection grew from simply holding artefacts to include diaries, artwork, photographs and biographies which captured the personal and social history of those involved in surveying and mapping. Many historical maps of Queensland were also acquired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1987, the museum moved to the newly constructed Landcentre building  in [[Woolloongabba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1988, in order to preserve the artefacts that had been collected an agreement was signed with the [[Queensland Museum]] to become custodian of the collections whilst the government provides staff to manage and run the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1991, the focus of the museum was broadened and it was renamed the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying to include history of land development in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2018, the museum relocated to 317 [[Edward Street, Brisbane|Edward Street]] in the [[Brisbane CBD]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''OrthoGraph I''' is a building survey and floor plan creation application for iOS and Android, developed in Hungary. It handles both structured alphanumeric data, and measures and handles all drawings real time in 3D. It has built-in Cloud functionality so files can be shared on multiple tablets or phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OrthoGraph|first1=OrthoGraph|title=OrthoGraph's website|url=http://www.orthograph.net|website=orthograph.net|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard output of the system can be [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]] (AutoCAD), [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Adobe) [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] (Industrial Foundation Classes), JPG and PNG and it can be exported to [[ArchiCAD]] with the help of a separate module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geo-matching.com|title=GEo-Matching-database|url=http://www.geo-matching.com/products/id2820-orthograph-architect.html|website=www.geo-matching.com/products/id2820-orthograph-architect.html|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the measurement process, Leica, Bosch and Stabila laser distance meters are supported to use, the measured data is transferred to the software via Bluetooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Jack|title=Company Spotlight|url=http://www.bimcrunch.com/company-spotlight-orthograph/|website=www.bimcrunch.com/company-spotlight-orthograph/|publisher=BIMcrunch|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OrthoGraph I has several features that are unique on the market of building surveying applications. The base of a floor plan needs to be drawn first and after measurements the created floor plans will adjust based on the calculations. Diagonal measurements also allow for mathematical accuracy.

The application handles the sketched and measured building-model according to the [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Building Information Modeling) concept. It means that it handles a hierarchical location-structure, every placed object has several properties, doors and windows have opening directions, and additionally there is the opportunity to add unique parameter fields with optional information.
The system is developed by the Hungarian Company named OrthoGraph.

==Company history==

The story of OrthoGraph goes back to 2004 when the first version of the software was launched for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] devices. In 2011, the iPad version of the app was released and this also meant that a new business model has been emerged.
This new version was a major breakthrough both in technological and in business aspects. The company’s gathered experience had been a good background for developing the iPad application, so from the very first moment, the OrthoGraph became one of the top professional building surveying /CAD application on the market.

In 2013, a cooperation agreement has been established between OrthoGraph and Leica, the result of this collaboration was that now several Leica laser distance meter is supported by OrthoGraph, the measurements can be transferred to the app via Bluetooth connection.

In the second half of the year, the company decided to exploit the benefits of the mobile technology and the Internet and created their own [[Cloud computing|cloud]] services. This new technology has made it possible that the first building surveying software that provides the opportunity of real teamwork was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laszlo|first1=Toth|title=OrthoGraph Cloud Introduced|url=http://orthograph.blogspot.hu/2013/11/orthograph-cloud-introduced-try-it-for.html|website=orthograph.blogspot.hu|publisher=OrthoGraph Blog|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the Bluetooth support of the Bosch GLM 100 C laser distance meter for OrthoGraph became available.
For 2014, the number of  OrthoGraph users reached 4,500. In August 2014, the OrthoGraph Architect App has been named the gold winner in App of the Year category and silver winner in the Most Innovative Product of the Year—SMB category in Best in Biz Awards 2014 International business awards program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frausto-Robledo|first1=Anthony|title=OrthoGraph wins Best in Biz|url=http://architosh.com/2014/07/orthograph-wins-best-in-biz-award-for-app-of-the-year/|website=architosh.com|publisher=Architosch|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the main goal for OrthoGraph was to be present on Android. After one and a half year on September 2016 the multiplatform version of the app was published, which was called OrthoGraph I. The completely changed UI was simpler, the features were more advanced to allow more accurate measurements and a faster work process. After 2 months of the release, OrthoGraph I won silver qualification in the "Best New Version of the Year" category of Best in Biz Awards 2016.

'''Pedro Álvares Cabral'''{{efn-ua|His name was spelled during his lifetime as "Pedro Álveres Cabral", "Pero Álvares Cabral", "Pedr'Álváres Cabral", "Pedrálvares Cabral", "Pedraluarez Cabral", among others. This article uses the most common spelling. See {{harvnb|McClymont|1914|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Tomlinson|1970|p=22}}, {{harvnb|Calmon|1981|p=44}}, {{harvnb|Capistrano de Abreu|1976|p=25}}, {{harvnb|Greenlee|1995|p=190}}.}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈpeðɾu ˈaɫvɐr(ɨ)ʃ kɐˈβɾaɫ|eu}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-pt|ˈpedɾu ˈawvaɾis kaˈbɾaw|br}}; c.&amp;nbsp;1467 or 1468 – c.&amp;nbsp;1520) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] nobleman, military commander, [[navigator]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]] regarded as the European discoverer of [[Brazil]]. In 1500 Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of [[South America]] and claimed it for Portugal. While details of Cabral's early life remain unclear, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Discovery of the sea route to India| newly-opened route]] around Africa. The undertaking had the aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in India—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab, Turkish and Italian merchants. Although the previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India, on its sea route, had recorded signs of land west of the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] (in 1497), Cabral led the first known expedition to have touched four continents: [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=187}};
*{{harv|Lunde|2005}};
*{{harv|Lima|2012|p=189}};

*{{harv|Belvederi|1998|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], perhaps intentionally, and made landfall (April 1500) on what he initially assumed to be a large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], Cabral claimed it for the [[King of Portugal | Portuguese Crown]]. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later came to be known as Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.

A storm in the southern Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the [[Mozambique Channel]] before proceeding to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese [[entrepôt]]. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], another Indian [[city-state]], where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a [[Portuguese Empire]] that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.{{efn-ua|The earliest origins of the Portuguese Empire can be traced back to the accession of King [[John I of Portugal|João I]] in 1385 and his subsequent wars of conquest in North Africa, as well as Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s exploratory voyages. The foundation of the Portuguese Empire, however, were firmly laid with the more substantial claim to the territory that would later become Brazil and the establishment of a trading concession in India. See {{harvnb|Diffie|Winius|1977|pp=39, 46, 93, 113, 191}}.}}

Cabral was later passed over, possibly as a result of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]]. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, historians consider Cabral to be a major figure of the [[Age of Discovery]].

Little is certain regarding Pedro Álvares Cabral's life before, or following, his voyage which led to the discovery of Brazil. He was born in 1467 or 1468—the former year being the most likely{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxxix}}{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=13}}—at [[Belmonte Municipality|Belmonte]], about {{convert|30|km}} from present-day [[Covilhã]] in central [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=34}};
*{{harv|Calmon|1981|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a son of Fernão Álvares Cabral and Isabel Gouveia—one of five boys and six girls in the family.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxxix}};
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=34}};
*{{harv|Espínola|2001|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabral was christened Pedro Álvares de Gouveia and only later, supposedly upon his elder brother's death in 1503,&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=34}};
*{{harv|Vieira|2000|p=28}};
*{{harv|Vainfas|2001|p=475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; did he begin using his father's surname.{{efn-ua|"The name used in his appointment as chief commander of the fleet for India is also Pedralvares de Gouveia." —William Brooks Greenlee in {{harvnb|Greenlee|1995|p=xl}}.}}{{sfn|Espínola|2001|p=232}}{{sfn|Fernandes|1969|p=53}} The coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver. Purple represented fidelity, and the goats were derived from the family name (''cabral'' pertains to ''goats'' in English).{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxxix}} However, only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family arms.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=2}}

Family lore said that the ''Cabrais'' were descendants of [[Caranus (king)|Caranus]], the legendary first king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. Caranus was, in turn, a supposed 7th-generation scion of the demigod [[Hercules]].{{efn-ua|"According to a family tradition the ''Cabraes'' were descended from a certain Carano or Caranus, the first king of the Macedonians and the seventh in descent from Hercules. Carano had been instructed by the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] to place the metropolis of is new kingdom at the spot to which he would be guided by goats and when he assaulted Edissa his army followed in the wake of a flock of goats just as the Bulgarians drove cattle before them when they took Adrianople. The king accordingly chose two goats for his cognisance and two goats passant gules on a field argent subsequently became the arms of the Cabraes. Herodotus knows nothing of Carano and the goats." —James McClymont in {{harvnb|McClymont|1914|p=1}}.}} Myths aside, the historian James McClymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of Cabral's family. According to that tradition, the ''Cabrais'' derive from a [[Castilian people|Castilian]] clan named the ''Cabreiras''  (''cabra'' is Spanish for goat) who bore a similar coat of arms.{{efn-ua|"A certain fidalgo who was commander of a fortress at Belmonte was with the garrison being starved into submission by investing forces. Two goats were still alive in the fortress. These were killed by order of the commander, cut into quarters and thrown to the enemy, whereupon the siege was raised as it was considered by the hostile commander that it was of no use to attempt to starve a garrison which could thus waste its provisions. It is also narrated that the son of the Castellan was taken prisoner and slain and that the horns and beards of the heraldic goats are sable as a token of mourning in consequence of this event." —James McClymont in {{harvnb|McClymont|1914|pp=1–2}}.}} The Cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century. Álvaro Gil Cabral (Cabral's great-great-grandfather and a frontier military commander) was one of the few Portuguese nobles to remain loyal to [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[John I of Portugal|João I]], King of Portugal [[1383–1385 Crisis|during the war against]] the King of Castile. As a reward, João I presented Álvaro Gil with the hereditary [[fief]]dom of Belmonte.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Raised as a member of the lower nobility,{{sfn|Subrahmanyam|1997|p=177}}{{sfn|Newitt|2005|p=64}} Cabral was sent to the court of King Dom [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] in 1479 at around age 12. He received an education in the [[humanities]] and learned to bear arms and fight.{{sfn|Abramo|1969|p=34}} He would have been roughly age 17 on 30 June 1484 when he was named ''moço fidalgo'' (young nobleman; a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles) by King Dom [[John II of Portugal|João II]].{{sfn|Abramo|1969|p=34}} Records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary, but Cabral may have campaigned in North Africa, as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day.&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Fleet commander-in-chief ===

On 15 February 1500, Cabral was appointed ''Capitão-mor'' (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|fleet sailing for India]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Fernandes|1969|p=53}};
*{{harv|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=187}};
*{{harv|Peres|1949|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then the custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence.{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=128}} This was the case for the captains of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=18}} The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] or Dom [[João de Castro]].{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=312}}

Scant details have survived regarding the criteria used by the Portuguese government in its selection of Cabral as head of the India expedition. In the royal decree naming him commander-in-chief, the only reasons given are "merits and services". Nothing more is known about these qualifications.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=34}} Historian William Greenlee argued that King Manuel I "had undoubtedly known him well at court". That, along with the "standing of the Cabral family, their unquestioned loyalty to the Crown, the personal appearance of Cabral, and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important factors".{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xli}} Also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the King's Council.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xli}} Given the political intrigue present at court, Cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xli}} The historian Malyn Newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of Cabral "was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families, for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions."{{sfn|Newitt|2005|p=65}}

Cabral became the military chief, while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=37}} The most important of these were [[Bartolomeu Dias]], [[Diogo Dias]] and [[Nicolau Coelho]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Newitt|2005|p=65}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xlii}};
*{{harv|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They would, along with the other captains, command 13 ships&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Espínola|2001|p=232}};
*{{harv|Newitt|2005|p=65}};
*{{harv|Pereira|1979|pp=63–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;See:

*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=18}};
*{{harv|Subrahmanyam|1997|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this contingent, 700 were soldiers, although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=38}}

The fleet had two divisions. The first division was composed of nine ''naus'' ([[carrack]]s) and two [[Square-rigged caravel| round caravels]], and was headed to Calicut (today more often known as [[Kozhikode]]) in India with the goal of establishing trade relations and a [[factory (trading post)]]. The second division, consisting of one ''nau'' and one round caravel, set sail for the port of [[Sofala]] in what is today [[Mozambique]].{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=22}} In exchange for leading the fleet, Cabral was entitled to 10,000 ''cruzados'' (an old Portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35&amp;nbsp;kg of gold) and the right to purchase {{convert|30|t|ST LT}} of [[Black pepper|pepper]] at his own expense for transport back to Europe. The pepper could then be resold, tax-free, to the Portuguese Crown.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=26}} He was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice, duty-free.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=26}} Although the voyage was extremely hazardous, Cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to Portugal with the cargo. Spices were then rare in Europe and keenly sought-after.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=26}}

An earlier fleet had been the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa. That expedition had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=88}} For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the [[Mediterranean Sea]] which was under the control of the Italian [[Maritime Republics]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical [[Prester John]]—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's [[spice trade]].{{sfn|Boxer|2002|pp=34–41}}

=== Departure and arrival in a new land ===

The fleet under the command of the 32–33-year-old Cabral departed from Lisbon on 9 March 1500 at noon. The previous day it had been given a public send-off which included a Mass and celebrations attended by the King, his court and a huge crowd.&lt;ref&gt;See:

*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet crossed the [[Equator]] on 9 April, and sailed westward as far as possible from the African continent in what was known as the ''[[volta do mar]]'' (literally "turn of the sea") navigational technique.{{sfn|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=189}}{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=45}} [[Seaweed]] was sighted on 21 April, which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast. They were proven correct the next afternoon, Wednesday 22 April 1500, when the fleet anchored near what Cabral christened the [[Monte Pascoal]] ("Easter Mount", it being the week of [[Easter]]). The spot is on the northeast coast of present-day Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See:

He can be seen on the shore (center) standing in front of an armored soldier, who is carrying a banner of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]].]]
The Portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore, and all ships' captains gathered aboard Cabral's lead ship on 23 April.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=89}} Cabral ordered Nicolau Coelho, a captain who had experience from Vasco da Gama's voyage to India, to go ashore and make contact. He set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=90}} After Coelho returned, Cabral took the fleet north, where after traveling {{convert|65|km}} along the coast, it anchored on 24 April in what the commander-in-chief named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Safe Port).{{sfn|Vianna|1994|p=44}} The place was a natural harbor, and Afonso Lopes (pilot of the lead ship) brought two natives aboard to confer with Cabral.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=95}}

As in the first contact, the meeting was friendly and Cabral presented the locals with gifts.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=97}} The inhabitants were [[Stone Age|stone age]] hunter-gatherers, to whom the Europeans assigned the generic label "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]". The men collected food by stalking game, fishing and foraging, while the women engaged in small-scale farming. They were divided into countless rival tribes. The tribe which Cabral met was the [[Tupiniquim]].{{sfn|Boxer|2002|pp=98–100}} Some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary—having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking. A few tribes engaged in cannibalism.{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=98}} On 26 April, as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared, Cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a Christian Mass was held—the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become Brazil. He, along with the ships' crews, participated.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=100}}

The following days were spent stockpiling water, food, wood and other provisions. The Portuguese also built a massive—perhaps {{convert|7|m}} long—wooden cross. Cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between Portugal and Spain that had been specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. The territory was thus within the sphere allotted to Portugal. To solemnize Portugal's claim to the land, the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1 May.{{sfn|Vianna|1994|p=44}}{{sfn|Bueno|1998|pp=106–108}} In honor of the cross, Cabral named the newly discovered land ''[[Ilha de Vera Cruz]]'' (Island of the True Cross).{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=109}} The next day a supply ship under the command of either [[Gaspar de Lemos]]{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=110}}{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xx}} or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]]{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=21}} (the sources conflict on who was sent){{sfn|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=193}} returned to Portugal to apprise the King of the discovery.

== Voyage to India ==

=== Tragedy off southern Africa ===
[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral fleet.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pen and ink sketch depicting various sailing ships, some of which are in the process of foundering|Twelve of 13 ships that were part of Cabral's fleet are depicted. Many were lost, as can be seen in this drawing from ''Memória das Armadas'', c.1568]]
The fleet resumed its voyage on either 2{{sfn|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=194}} or 3{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=21}} May 1500 and sailed along the east coast of South America. Cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent, rather than an island.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=116}} Around 5 May, the fleet veered eastwards towards Africa.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=116}} On 23{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=116}} or 24{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xx}} May they encountered a storm in the South Atlantic's high-pressure zone, resulting in the loss of four ships. The exact location of the disaster is unknown—speculations range from near the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern tip of the African continent{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=116}} to "within sight of the South American coast".{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=23}} Three ''naus'' and a caravel commanded by Bartolomeu Dias—the first European to reach the Cape of Good Hope in 1488—foundered, and 380 men were lost.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=117}}

The remaining vessels, hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging, were separated. One ship that had been separated, commanded by Diogo Dias, wandered onward alone,{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxi}} and the other six ships were able to regroup. They gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each, and Cabral's group sailed east, past the Cape of Good Hope. Fixing their position and sighting land, they turned north and landed somewhere in the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago]], off East Africa and north of [[Sofala]].{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxi}}{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=25}} The main fleet remained near Sofala ten days undergoing repairs.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxi}}{{sfn|McClymont|1914|pp=26–27}} The expedition then went north, and on 26 May reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani]], where Cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|pp=xxi–xxii}}

From Kilwa Kisiwani, the fleet departed to [[Malindi]], which was reached on 2 August. Cabral met with its king, with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts. Pilots were recruited at Malindi for the last leg to India and the fleet set sail. Land was reached at [[Anjadip Island|Anjadip]], an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to Calicut. Here the ships were beached, recaulked and painted. Final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of Calicut.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxii}};
*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=27}};
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massacre in Calicut ===
The fleet departed Anjadip and arrived in Calicut on 13 September.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=194}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxii}};
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabral successfully negotiated with the [[Saamoothiri|Zamorin]] (the title of the ruler of Calicut) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=27}} In hopes of further improving relations, Cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the Zamorin's request.{{efn-ua|The "Zamorin asked Pedro Alvares Cabral a favor. The former was interested in one of the seven elephants carried in a ship belonging to a merchant from Cochin which was passing by Calicut. As a token of friendship, Alvares Cabral was requested to capture the ship and get the elephant on which the Zamorin's eyes were fixed. Though Cabral did not want to run the risk of offending the King of Cochin, he had to come forward to show a good gesture to the Zamorin. He put two noble men and sixty soldiers in charge of a ship (''nau'') and ordered them to capture the elephants along with the ship of the Cochim merchant. Pêro [Pedro] de Ataíde was put in command of the Portuguese vessel which was supposed to overpower the ship of the above mentioned merchant well armed with 300 fighters on board. Pêro de Ataíde confronted the Indian ship near [[Kannur|Cannanore]]. The Indian ship sent a host of arrows and shots of cannons  from its guns toward the Portuguese ship. The Portuguese ship responded promptly with all her artillery. As desired by the Zamorin, the coveted elephants were delivered to him by Pêro de Ataíde after capturing the ship. This boosted the military prestige of the Portuguese. [...] Besides, Pêro de Ataíde managed to destroy four ships of the Muslims near Canannore and a few ''paraus''. Another day, five ships were put to flight by Pêro de Ataíde. As the prestige of the Portuguese Navy went on increasing day by day, the Zamorin himself began to fear that Portuguese might destroy the kingdom of Calicut. [...] As a result the Zamorin permitted the Muslims to attack the Portuguese factory at Calicut who killed Aires Correa and fifth Portuguese men in the factory." —K. K. N. Kurup in {{harvnb|Kurup|1997|p=10}}.}} However, on 16{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=119}} or 17{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=28}} December, the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=119}} (according to other accounts, perhaps as many as several thousand){{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=27}} Muslim Arabs and Hindu Indians. Despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen, more than 50 Portuguese were killed.{{efn-ua|Other sources give figures which vary between 20 and 70 Portuguese who were wounded or murdered. See {{harvnb|Greenlee|1995|p=xxiii}}.}}{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=119}}{{sfn|Kurup|1997|p=10}} The remaining defenders retreated to the ships, some by swimming. Thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous Arab merchants, Cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of Calicut, but no apology was forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=28}};
*{{harv|Kurup|1997|p=10}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 Arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor. Around 600 of their crews{{sfn|Kurup|1997|p=10}} were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=28}}{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxiii}} Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=28}}{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxiii}} The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxiv}} Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade. The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler's Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders. The Muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods,{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxv}} and attempted to sway the Hindu ruler against the Portuguese. The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|pp=xxvi, xxxiii}}
[[File:Carrack 1565.jpg|thumb|alt=An illustration from an old map which shows a wooden sailing vessel with a square-rigged foresail, a square-rigged main mast with main and topsail, and a lateen sail aft over a very high stern|The ''nau'' ([[carrack]]) was a type of vessel that was larger than a [[caravel]] but smaller than the later [[galleon]]. They were used in the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], Vasco da Gama and Cabral.{{sfn|Boxer|2002|loc=gallery|pp=222–223}}]]
Historian William Greenlee has argued that the Portuguese realized that "they were few in numbers and that those who would come to India in the future fleets would always be at numerical disadvantage; so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the Portuguese would be feared and respected in the future. It was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end." Thus, they created a precedent for [[Gunboat diplomacy|European behavior in Asia]] during the following centuries.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|pp=xxiv, xxxiii}}

=== Return to Europe ===
Warnings in reports from Vasco da Gama's voyage to India had prompted King Manuel I to brief Cabral regarding another port to the south of Calicut where he could also trade. This city was [[Kochi]] and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 December.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxvii}} Kochi was nominally a vassal of Calicut, as well as being dominated by other Indian cities. Kochi was eager to achieve independence, and the Portuguese were willing to exploit Indian disunity—as the British would three hundred years later. This tactic eventually ensured Portuguese hegemony over the region.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxvii}} Cabral forged an alliance with Kochi's ruler, as well with rulers of other Indian cities, and was able to establish a factory. At last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to [[Kannur]] for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to Portugal on 16 January 1501.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=119}};
*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=28}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition headed for the east coast of Africa. One of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder. As there was no space in the other ships, its cargo was lost and Cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xxviii}};
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=120}};
*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet then proceeded to the [[Island of Mozambique]] (northeast of Sofala), in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the Cape of Good Hope.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxix}} One caravel was sent to Sofala—another of the expedition's goals. A second caravel, considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by Nicolau Coelho, was sent ahead to give the King advance notice of the voyage's success. A third vessel, commanded by [[Pedro de Ataíde]], became separated from the fleet after leaving Mozambique.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxix}}

On 22 May, the fleet—now reduced to only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=35}} They arrived in Beseguiche (now [[Dakar]], located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel but also the ''nau'' captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the South Atlantic. The ''nau'' had experienced several adventures of its own{{efn-ua|Having struck a route too far east, Dias was the first European to sight the island of [[Madagascar]]. He befriended its native inhabitants and sailed back to the African coast. Dias's subsequent attempts to find the main fleet ended with him mistakenly sailing past [[Cape Guardafui]] and into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships. Trapped by contrary winds, Dias spent several harrowing months in the area, battered by tempests, attacked by pirates and finally forced aground on the Eritrean coast, in a desperate search for water and food for his rapidly dying crew. Dias, the number of his crewmen constantly diminishing, eventually managed the difficult voyage southward along the east coast of Africa, around the Horn and back to northwest Africa, where they again met with Cabral's fleet after more than a year's separation. See {{harvnb|Greenlee|1995|pp=xxi, xxix}}, {{harvnb|Bueno|1998|pp=118, 120}}, {{harvnb|McClymont|1914|pp=23–24}}.}} and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=120}} Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (for whom the [[Americas]] would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=121}}

Nicolau Coelho's caravel departed first from Beseguiche and arrived in Portugal on 23 June 1501.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=122}} Cabral stayed behind, waiting for Pedro de Ataíde's missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to Sofala. Both eventually appeared and Cabral arrived in Portugal on 21 July 1501, with the other vessels coming home during the following days.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxx}} In all, two ships returned empty, five were fully loaded and six were lost. Nonetheless, the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800% profit to the Portuguese Crown.{{sfn|Espínola|2001|p=234}} Once sold, the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet, covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost, and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|pp=31–32}} "Undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained", asserts historian James McClymont, when Cabral "reached the East African coast, pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage."{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=35}} "Few voyages to Brazil and India were so well executed as Cabral's", affirmed historian [[Bailey W. Diffie|Bailey Diffie]],{{sfn|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=190}} which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement "of a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese seagoing empire]] from Africa to the far East", and eventually to "a [[Colonial Brazil|land empire in Brazil]]".{{sfn|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=194}}

Upon Cabral's return, King Manuel I began planning another fleet to make the journey to India and to avenge the Portuguese losses in Calicut. Cabral was selected to command this "[[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Revenge Fleet]]", as it was called. For eight months Cabral made all preparations,{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliii}} but for reasons which remain uncertain, he was relieved of command.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=125}} It had apparently been proposed to give another navigator, [[Vicente Sodré]], independent command over a section of the fleet, and Cabral strongly opposed this.&lt;ref&gt;See:

*{{harv|Newitt|2005|p=67}};
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he was dismissed{{sfn|Newitt|2005|p=67}} or requested himself that he be relieved of command,{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=32}} the result was that when the fleet departed in March 1502, its commander was Vasco da Gama—a maternal nephew of Vicente Sodré—and not Cabral.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=126}};
*{{harv|Newitt|2005|p=67}};
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da Gama and another supporting Cabral. At some point, Cabral left the court permanently.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliii}} The King was greatly irritated by the feud, to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment, as it did for one of da Gama's supporters.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}}

Despite the loss of favor with Manuel I,{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=125}}{{sfn|Abramo|1969|p=42}} Cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}}{{sfn|Presser|2006|p=249}} to ''Dona'' ([[Lady]]) Isabel de Castro, a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of King Dom [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}} Her mother was a sister of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], one of the greatest Portuguese military leaders during the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Subrahmanyam|1997|p=177}};
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=36}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had at least four children: two boys (Fernão Álvares Cabral and António Cabral) and two girls (Catarina de Castro and Guiomar de Castro).{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=3}} There were two additional daughters named Isabel and Leonor according to other sources, which also say that Guiomar, Isabel and Leonor joined religious orders.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xlv}} Afonso de Albuquerque attempted to intercede on Cabral's behalf and on 2 December 1514 asked Manuel I to forgive him and allow his return to court, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Subrahmanyam|1997|p=177}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}};
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor (possibly [[malaria]]) since his voyage,{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=126}} Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there.{{sfn|Subrahmanyam|1997|p=177}}{{sfn|Abramo|1969|p=42}} Only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time. According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him.{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}}{{sfn|McClymont|1914|pp=32–33}} Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=33}}{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}} In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from ''fidalgo'' to knight in the King's Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 ''reais''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|McClymont|1914|p=33}};
*{{harv|Greenlee|1995|p=xliv}};
*{{harv|Abramo|1969|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid.{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=33}} Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the [[Igreja da Graça (Santarém)|Convento da Graça]] in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Posthumous rehabilitation ===
[[File:Cantino planisphere (1502).jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Photograph showing an old map which covers the area from the Atlantic coast of the South American continent eastwards around Africa to India and on to the Malay peninsula at the eastern edge of the map, with Europe in the far north.|[[Cantino planisphere]] 1502,  one of the earliest surviving charts showing the explorations of Pedro Álvares Cabral to Brazil. The [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line is also depicted.]]
The first permanent Portuguese settlement in the land which would become Brazil was [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], which was established in 1532 by [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]]. As the years passed, the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal as the most important part of its far-flung [[Portuguese Empire|maritime Empire]]. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] secured the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of Brazil]] from Portugal and, as Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], became its first Emperor.{{sfn|Revista Trimestral de História e Geografia|1840|p=137}}{{sfn|Vieira|2000|pp=28–29}}

Cabral's discovery, and even his resting place in the land of his birth, had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition.{{sfn|Revista Trimestral de História e Geografia|1840|p=137}}{{sfn|Vieira|2000|pp=28–29}} This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral's life and expedition through the [[Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute]]. This was part of the Emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a [[Exceptionalism|unique]] [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking empire, surrounded by [[Hispanic America|Hispanic-American Republics]].{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=126}} The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the Brazilian historian [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]] (later Viscount of Porto Seguro).{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=126}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=985}} The completely neglected state in which Cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II's eldest sister, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]].{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=130}}

In 1871, the Brazilian Emperor—then on a trip to Europe—visited Cabral's gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study, which was carried out in 1882.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=985}} In a second exhumation during 1896, an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed. Although his remains still lay in Portugal, the urn was eventually brought to the old [[Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro|Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil on 30 December 1903.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=985}} Cabral has since become a national hero in Brazil.{{sfn||Smith|1990|p=5}} In Portugal, however, he has been much overshadowed by his rival Vasco da Gama.{{sfn|Alves Filho|1997|p=195}}{{sfn|Berrini|2000|p=168}} Historian William Greenlee argued that Cabral's exploration is important "not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period." Though he acknowledges that few voyages have "been of greater importance to posterity", he also says that "few have been less appreciated in their time."{{sfn|Greenlee|1995|p=xxxiv}} Nevertheless, historian James McClymont affirmed that "Cabral's position in the history of Portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men."{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=36}} He concluded that Cabral "will always be remembered in history as the chief, if not the first discoverer of Brazil."{{sfn|McClymont|1914|p=36}}

=== Intentional discovery hypothesis ===
[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A photograph of a park in which stands a large statue depicting a bearded man standing on a rock who is dressed in a long coat and holding a hat in his right hand, while his left hand grasps a large banner|Monument to Cabral, Lisbon]]
[[File:A Cabral.jpg|thumb|170px|Monument to Cabral, Brazil]]
A controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.{{sfn|Pereira|1979|p=54}}

Until the 1854 conference, the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident. Early works on the subject supported this view, including ''História do Descobrimento e Conquista da Índia'' (History of the Discovery and Conquest of India, published in 1541) by [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]], ''Décadas da Ásia'' (Decades of Asia, 1552) by [[João de Barros]], ''Crônicas do Felicíssimo Rei D. Manuel'' (Chronicles of the most fortunate D. Manuel, 1558) by [[Damião de Góis]], ''Lendas da Índia'' (Legends of India, 1561) by [[Gaspar Correia]],{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=127}} ''História do Brasil'' (History of Brazil, 1627) by friar Vicente do Salvador and ''História da América Portuguesa'' (History of Portuguese America, 1730) by Sebastião da Rocha Pita.{{sfn|Vainfas|2001|p=183}}

The first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by Joaquim Noberto de Sousa e Silva, after Pedro II had opened the debate.{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=129}} Since then, several scholars have subscribed to that view, including Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen,{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=130}} [[Capistrano de Abreu]],{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=130}} Pedro Calmon,{{sfn|Calmon|1981|p=51}} Fábio Ramos{{sfn|Ramos|2008|p=168}} and Mário Barata.{{sfn|Barata|1991|p=46}} Historian Hélio Vianna affirmed that "although there are signs of the intentionality" in Cabral's discovery, "based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the South Atlantic", there are no irrefutable proofs to support it.{{sfn|Vianna|1994|p=19}} This opinion is also shared by historian [[Thomas Skidmore]].{{sfn|Skidmore|2003|p=21}} The debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered "irrelevant" by historian [[C. R. Boxer|Charles R. Boxer]].{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=98}} Historian Anthony Smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will "probably never be resolved".{{sfn|Smith|1990|p=9}}

=== Forerunners ===
[[File:TextoVYP mapaLaCosa.JPG|thumb|left|alt=An old, hand-drawn map with a large compass rose on the right side and a coastline drawn on the left side with writing occupying the center|The [[map of Juan de la Cosa]], dated 1500, mentions the travel to northern Brazil by [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]].]]
Cabral was not the first European to stumble upon areas of present-day Brazil, not to mention other parts of South America. Roman coins have been found in today's [[Venezuela]], northwest of Brazil, presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in [[Ancient history|ancient times]].{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=31}} Norsemen reached North America and even [[Norse colonization of the Americas|established settlements]], though these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th century.{{sfn|Boxer|2002|p=31}} [[Christopher Columbus]], on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.{{sfn|Barata|1991|p=46}}

In the case of Brazil, it was once considered probable that the Portuguese navigator [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498. This belief has since been dismissed, however, and it is now thought that he voyaged to North America instead.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harv|Peres|1949|p=114}};
*{{harv|Bueno|1998|p=131}};
*{{harv|Vianna|1994|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards, [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500. Pinzón went from what is today [[Fortaleza]] (capital of the Brazilian state of [[Ceará]]) to the mouth of the [[Amazon River]]. There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe, which would reach as far as the [[Oyapock]] River in March. The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil, rather than the Spanish explorers, is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact. Historians [[Capistrano de Abreu]],{{sfn|Bueno|1998|p=132}} Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen,{{sfn|Varnhagen|p=81}} Mário Barata{{sfn|Barata|1991|pp=47–48}} and Hélio Vianna{{sfn|Vianna|1994|p=46}} concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas—with a unique history, culture and society which sets it apart from the Hispanic-American societies which dominate the rest of the continent.

==History==
The General Survey of Madrid between 1749 and 1774 was one of the most important cadastral surveys of the Old Spanish regime.  The Planimetría General de Madrid resulted in the production 557 plans of blocks throughout Madrid.&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

In the cadastre documentary data were collected on the ownership of Madrid properties and other features such as previous owners, map showing the plots into which each [[City block|manzana]] or block was divided, description of the configuration and structure of each building, size and quality of the building, indication of the name and number of tenants housed per room, the tax status according to the [[regalía de aposento|aposento]] charged, among other indicators. Each block was then numbered and identified with the objective of levying taxes. This identification done by the general visit resulted in a white tile being laid on every house with writing in blue letters indicating the number assigned: "Visita G. Casa nº123" (General Visit House # 123).&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

The initial intentions of the [[Zenón de Somodevilla, 1st Marqués de la Ensenada|Marqués de la Ensenada]] was to renew the tax system in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Among the constraints imposed on the inhabitants of Madrid was the [[regalía de aposento]]. The method by which taxes were imposed was based on the "Visita General" which identified the nature of property ownership and assessed the taxes on inhabitants accordingly.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

The imprecision of the method resulted in it being eventually abandoned. It was repealed by [[Joaquín Vizcaíno|Marqués Viudo de Pontejos]] who replaced it with a more logical which consisted of identifying streets with names of famous persons and historical events. The white numbered tiles that were laid by officials during the survey are still evidenced on the façade of Madridean houses especially in the historic center of Madrid.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

The '''SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD)''' is a geographical dataset (2003) encoding high-resolution worldwide coastline outlines in a [[vector graphics|vector]] format, published by [[NASA]] and designed for use in [[geographic information system]]s and mapping applications. It was created by BAE Systems ADR for the US [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) as a complementary product during editing of the [[digital elevation model]] database of the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM). SWBD data covers the Earth's surface between 56° southern latitude and 60° northern latitude. It is distributed in [[ESRI shapefile]] format, divided into 12,229 files, each covering one 1°-by-1° tile of the Earth's surface.

SWBD data is in the [[public domain]] and is made available online for free download by NASA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1650">'''Sambal-Lei Sekpil''' is the world's tallest [[topiary]].  Created by Moirangthem Okendra Kumbi, it is modelled in the shape of a series of open umbrellas and spheres. 

Okendra started mending the Sambal-Lei in 1983, originally planted by his sister in a small mustard oil can.  Sambal-Lei is a flowering shrub use for fencing gardens in [[Manipur]] - ''Sambal'' means fencing and ''Lei'' means flower in [[Meitei language|Meitei]] language. ''Sekpil'' indicates the shape of the topiary and is derived from an ancient Meitei word for a decorative [[bamboo]] post with rounded structured cloths forming canopy in many stages. The sekpil, at present also called as "Shattra" is generally used in worship and festivals in Manipur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="578">'''Summer draft''' is a [[navy|naval]] term for the worst-case loaded draft a ship can have. This draft is corrected for the worst-case seasonal conditions (summer in this case). During summer the water is warmer, and thus less dense and expands slightly: see [[Thermal expansion]]. This makes ships float deeper in the water. Summer draft is the opposite of [[Light displacement|Light ship condition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7844">'''Toponymic Guidelines''' (full title: ''Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors, for international use'') are up-to-date documents promoted by the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] (UNGEGN). The aim of these documents is to compile information on [[Toponymy|toponymic]] issues of a certain country, especially from the perspective of [[standardization]] of geographical names.

==Origin==
At the Third [[United Nations]] Conference on the Standardization of geographical Names held in August/September 1977 at [[Athens]] (Greece), gathering and dissemination of toponymic information was discussed. The great variation in approaches from country to country led [[Josef Breu]], who was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts (UNGEGN) on that very Conference, to initiate the compilation of more or less standardized Toponymic Guidelines. As a sample for these guidelines he elaborated Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography of his native Austria and presented them as Working Paper Nr. 5 at the Eighth Session of The UNGEGN, held in February/March 1979 at [[New York City|New York]]. This sample sticks to the table of contents which Breu had already outlined in 1977.

==UN resolutions promoting Toponymic Guidelines==
The echo on Breus proposal was very positive. In the years to come four [[United Nations Resolution|resolutions]] were adopted in favour of the promotion of Toponymic Guidelines. At the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names ([[Geneva]], August/September 1982) resolution nr. 4 was drafted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/4th-uncsgn-docs/4-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fourth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 29]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the Publication of Toponymic Guidelines for map and other editors: This resolution presents a checklist on the contents of Guidelines and recommends that the Toponymic Guidelines submitted by Austria should serve as a sample of format and contents. It also recommends that a correspondent should be appointed by the UNGEGN to coordinate the work of developing national Toponymic Guidelines and to maintain communication with national experts involved in their elaboration.

At the 5th United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names ([[Montreal]], August 1987) another two resolutions were passed that concern Toponymic Guidelines: Resolution nr. 11 recommends that a clear typographical distinction should be made on national maps between toponyms and text items for other purposes. The methods of differentiations should be explained in the national Toponymic Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/5th-uncsgn-doc/5-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution nr. 14 of this Conference recommends that countries should be strongly encouraged to publish and keep up to date Toponymic Guidelines, and that the United Nations Secretariat should provide appropriate assistance for their publication and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/5th-uncsgn-doc/5-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 6th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (New York, August/September 1992) resolution nr. 14 recommends Toponymic Guidelines in combined volumes, in at least one of the working languages of the United Nations, and that provision should be made to issue the Guidelines in the World Cartography bulletin.

The title of the Toponymic Guidelines has been modified in 1982 and 1986. Whereas Breu in his sample used the title ''Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography'', the above-mentioned resolution nr. 4 of the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names uses the title ''Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors''. In 1986, on the 12th Session of the UNGEGN, it was decided to add ''for international use'' to the title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/12th-gegn-docs/12th_gegn_E.pdf Report of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names on the Work of its Twelfth Session, page 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Spelling rules for geographical names;
* Aids to pronunciation of geographical names;
* Linguistic [[Substratum|substrata]] recognizable in the existing place names, but only as far as their knowledge could be of benefit to the [[cartographer]];
* Relationship between [[Dialect|dialect(s)]] and [[Standard language|standard language(s)]];
* Peculiarities of dialect and areal distribution of the main dialects;
