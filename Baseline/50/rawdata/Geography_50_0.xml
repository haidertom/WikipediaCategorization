{{Location map-line|lat=49}}

The '''49th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 49[[degree (angle)|°]] [[true north|north]] of [[Earth]]'s [[equator]]. It crosses [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[North America]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The city of [[Paris]] is about {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the 49th parallel and is the largest city between the [[48th parallel north|48th]] and 49th parallels. Its main airport, [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], lies on the parallel.

Roughly {{convert|3500|km|mi|0}} &lt;!-- length found at wikilink [[Canada–United States border#Border lengths]] --&gt;of the [[Canada–United States border]] was designated to follow the 49th parallel from [[British Columbia]] to [[Manitoba]] on the [[Canada]] side, and from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to [[Minnesota]] on the [[United States|U.S.]] side, more specifically from the [[Strait of Georgia]] to the [[Lake of the Woods]]. This [[Border|international border]] was specified in the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] and the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, though survey markers placed in the 19th century cause the border to deviate from the 49th parallel by up to tens of meters.

From a point on the ground at this latitude, the [[sun]] is above the horizon for 16 hours, 12 minutes during the [[summer solstice]] and 8 hours, 14 minutes during the [[winter solstice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php|title=Duration of Daylight/Darkness Table for One Year|author=|date=|website=aa.usno.navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latitude also roughly corresponds to the minimum latitude in which astronomical twilight can last all night near the summer solstice. Slightly less than 1/8 of the Earth's surface is north of the 49th parallel.

[[File:49 parallel waterton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|49th parallel at [[Waterton Lake]], showing the cleared strip of land along the U.S./Canada border]]

=== History ===

In 1714, the Hudson's Bay Company proposed the 49th parallel as the western portion of the boundary between the company's land and French territory. At the time, Britain and France had agreed, in the Treaty of Utrecht, to negotiate a boundary, but negotiations ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lass|first1=William E.|title=Minnesota's Boundary with Canada: Its Evolution Since 1783|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXAu-xA3y3gC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=hudson's+bay+company+1714+boundary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ad9yNtLDDC&amp;sig=X7ZsrR6Ooq4gdDJ7ikWGGaECFDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii7srxipfZAhXB0FMKHeAQBnwQ6AEIQjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=hudson's%20bay%20company%201714%20boundary&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States in 1803, it was generally agreed that the boundary between the new territory and [[British North America]] was along the [[Water divide|watershed]] between the [[Missouri River]] and [[Mississippi River]] basins on one side and the [[Hudson Bay]] basin on the other. However, it is often difficult to precisely determine the location of a watershed in a region of level plains, such as in central [[North America]]. The British and American committees that met after the [[War of 1812]] to resolve boundary disputes recognized there would be much animosity in surveying the watershed boundary, and agreed on a simpler border solution in 1818: the 49th parallel. Both sides gained and lost some territory by this convention, but the United States gained more than it lost, in particular securing title to the [[Red River Basin]]. This convention established the boundary only between the [[Lake of the Woods]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]; west of the Rockies, the convention established joint occupation of the [[Oregon Country]] by both parties. A geographical oversight at the Lake of the Woods resulted in the creation of the [[Northwest Angle]].

Although the Convention of 1818 settled the boundary, neither country was immediately able to control over the territories on its side of the line: effective control still rested with local Indian tribes, mainly the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]].  Their power was gradually ceded by conquest and treaty during the several decades that followed.  Among these peoples, the 49th parallel was nicknamed the '''Medicine Line''' because of its seemingly magical ability to prevent U.S. soldiers from crossing it.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 U.S. presidential election]], the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] asserted that the northern border of the [[Oregon Territory]] should be 54°40&amp;prime;, later reflected in the 1846 slogan "[[Oregon boundary dispute|Fifty-Four Forty or Fight]]!" However, the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled diplomatically in the 1846 Oregon Treaty. This agreement divided the Oregon Country between [[British North America]] and the United States by extending the 49th parallel boundary to the west coast, ending in the [[Strait of Georgia]]; it then circumvents [[Vancouver Island]] through [[Boundary Pass]], [[Haro Strait]], and the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]. This had the side effect of isolating [[Point Roberts, Washington]].

=== As border ===
[[File:Peacearch-boundarymarkers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A typical boundary marker, one of many along the 49th parallel. This one divides [[Blaine, Washington]] from [[Surrey, British Columbia]].]]
[[File:49th parallel US Canada border.svg|thumb|right|The 49th parallel north as a border between the [[Canadian province]]s of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] (to the north), and the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] (to the south).]]

Although parts of Vancouver Island and parts of Eastern Canada are south of the 49th parallel, and parts of the United States ([[Alaska]], [[Northwest Angle]]) are north of it, the term ''49th parallel'' is sometimes used [[metonymic]]ally to refer to the entire Canada-U.S. border. Actually, many of Canada's most populated regions (and about 72% of the population) are south of the 49th parallel, including the two largest cities [[Toronto]] (43°42′ north) and [[Montreal]] (45°30′ north), the federal capital [[Ottawa]] (45°25′ north) and the capitals of all provinces except the [[Prairie provinces]] ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]), these being the only provinces entirely north of the 49th parallel. The three [[Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] are each entirely south of the parallel, but the vast majority of Canadian territory lies north of it.

Parts of the 49th parallel were originally surveyed using astronomical techniques that did not take into account slight departures of the Earth's shape from a simple [[ellipsoid]], or the deflection of the [[plumb-bob]] by differences in terrestrial mass. The surveys were subject to the limitations of early to mid-19th century technology, but accurate results were obtained. However, in some places the surveyed 49th parallel is several hundred feet from the geographical 49th parallel for the currently adopted [[datum (geodesy)|datum]], the [[North American Datum]] of 1983 (NAD 83). The [[Digital Chart of the World]] (DCW), which uses the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid, reports the border on average at latitude 48°&amp;nbsp;59′&amp;nbsp;51″&amp;nbsp;north, roughly {{convert|270|m|0}} south of the modern 49th parallel. It ranges between 48°&amp;nbsp;59′&amp;nbsp;25″ and 49°&amp;nbsp;0′&amp;nbsp;10″&amp;nbsp;north, {{convert|810|m|0}} and {{convert|590|m|0}} on either side of the average. In any case, the Earth's North Pole moves around slightly, notionally moving the 49th and other parallels with it; see [[polar motion]].

The [[Northwest Angle]] is the only part of the contiguous 48 states that goes north of the 49th parallel. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] called for the boundary between the US and British territory to pass through the most northwesterly point of Lake of the Woods, and this was retained even after [[Treaty of 1818|an 1818 treaty]] set the boundary west of that point to follow the 49th parallel.

At the time that the United States and Great Britain agreed on the 49th parallel as the boundary, much of the North American continent had not yet been mapped. After the boundary was established, British surveyors discovered that [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]] lay south of the 49th parallel. The British requested that the United States cede the territory to Great Britain, but no action was ever taken.

In 1909 the United States, United Kingdom and Canada signed and ratified a treaty confirming the original survey lines as the official and permanent international border. Nevertheless, in 2002 the difference of the survey from the geographical 49th parallel was argued in front of the [[Washington Supreme Court]] in the case of ''State of Washington v. Norman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE of Washington, Respondent, v. Helen NORMAN|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-supreme-court/1329211.html|website=Findlaw|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the premise that Washington did not properly incorporate the portions of land north of the geographical 49th parallel, as laid out by detailed [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] surveying. The court decided against the premise, ruling that the internationally surveyed boundary also served as the state boundary, regardless of its actual position.

[[File:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|right|350px|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (in this example north) and a [[sightline|line]] from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the [[zenith]].]]

An '''azimuth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-azimuth.ogg|ˈ|æ|z|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}) (from the pl. form of the Arabic noun "السَّمْت" ''as-samt'', meaning "the direction") is an [[Angle#Measuring angles|angular measurement]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&amp;nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].

==Navigation==
[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen (Sandstone Peak), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (23 December 1944), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as "(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated "S30°E", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. "due east", is used instead.

==Cartographical azimuth==
The cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{180}{\pi} \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Caveat:''' Most computer libraries (C/C++, Python, Java, ...) reverse the order of the [[atan2]] parameters.

===Calculating coordinates===
When the coordinates (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of one point, the distance ''L'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_2 &amp;= X_1 + L \sin\alpha \\
  Y_2 &amp;= Y_1 + L \cos\alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is typically used in [[triangulation]].

==Calculating azimuth==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
We are standing at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2&lt;/math&gt;, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\cos\varphi_1 \tan\varphi_2 - \sin\varphi_1 \cos L}&lt;/math&gt;

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&amp;nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.

Various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].

Normal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance {{citation needed|reason=No mention of (Guy) Bomford or Cunningham anywhere else on this page|date=September 2015}}. If ''f'' is the flattening for the chosen spheroid (e.g., {{frac|{{val|298.257223563}}}} for [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         e^2 &amp;= f(2 - f) \\
     1 - e^2 &amp;= (1 - f)^2 \\
     \Lambda &amp;= \left(1 - e^2\right) \frac{\tan \varphi_2}{ \tan \varphi_1} + e^2 \sqrt{\cfrac {1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_2\right)^2}{1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_1\right)^2}} \\
  \tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\sin L}{(\Lambda - \cos L)\sin\varphi_1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\left(1 - e^2\right)\tan\varphi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).

==Mapping==
There is a wide variety of [[Map projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projections]]. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.

==Astronomy==
Used in celestial navigation, an ''azimuth'' is the direction of a celestial body from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, Carl, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In astronomy, an ''azimuth'' is sometimes referred to as a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]. In modern [[astronomy]] azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.
(The article on [[Celestial coordinate system|coordinate systems]], for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the [[hour angle]] of a [[star]] was zero. This assumes, however, that the star [[culmination|(upper) culminates]] in the south, which is only true if the star's [[declination]] is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's [[latitude]].

==Other systems==

===Right ascension===
If, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the [[celestial equator]], the angles are called [[right ascension]] if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the [[celestial meridian]].

===Horizontal coordinate===
In the [[horizontal coordinate system]], used in [[celestial navigation]] and [[satellite dish]] installation, azimuth is one of the two [[coordinate system|coordinates]]. The other is [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: [[Sat finder]].

===Polar coordinate===
In mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] or [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] is the anticlockwise [[angle]] between the positive ''x''-axis and the projection of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] onto the ''xy''-[[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The angle is the same as an angle in [[polar coordinates]] of the component of the vector in the ''xy''-plane and is normally measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications [[theta]], ''θ'', is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol  [[phi (letter)|phi]] ''φ''.

==Other uses of the word==
For [[tape drive|magnetic tape drives]], ''azimuth'' refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.

In [[sound localization]] experiments and literature, the ''azimuth'' refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.

An [[azimuth thruster]] in [[shipbuilding]] is a [[propeller]] that can be rotated horizontally.

==Etymology of the word==
The word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic ''al-sumūt'', pronounced ''as-sumūt'' in Arabic, meaning "the directions" (plural of Arabic ''al-samt'' = "the direction"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the [[Astrolabe]] astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomía]]'' commissioned by [[King Alfonso X]] of Castile.&lt;ref&gt;"Azimuth" at [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/602/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']; "azimut" at [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/azimut ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'']; "al-Samt" at [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-samt-SIM_6591 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam'']; "azimuth" at [http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 EnglishWordsOfArabicAncestry.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102020035/http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 |date=January 2, 2014 }}. In Arabic the written ''al-sumūt'' is always pronounced ''as-sumūt'' (see [[Sun and moon letters|pronunciation of "al-" in Arabic]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Border irregularities of the United States''', particularly [[panhandles]] and highway incursions into other jurisdictions, are shown here. Often they are a result of borders which do not conform to geological features.

== International ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Canada–United States border#Boundary divisions}}There are several exclaves between the United States and Canada, including the entire state of [[Alaska]] (though the state can still be accessed by sea from the United States). Other exclaves include [[Akwesasne]], the [[Northwest Angle]], and [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]. 

The status of the waters around [[Dixon Entrance|Nunez Rocks]] is disputed. Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation ("bare at half-tide"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NSDE/|author=U.S. National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) area (LTE) that is south of a line known as the "A-B" Line,&lt;ref name="IBRU"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-3_gray.pdf |title=Canada's Unresolved Maritime Boundaries|page=61|last=Gray|first=David H.| work= IBRU Boundary and Security Bulletin|year=Autumn 1997|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined in a 1903 arbitration decision on the [[Alaska boundary dispute|Alaska–Canada boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/coordinates/PortlandCanal.htm |title= International Boundary Commission definition of the Canada/US boundary in the NAD83 CSRS reference frame |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court specified the initial boundary point (Point "A") at the northern end of Dixon Entrance&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundary Disputes and Treaties|first=James|last=White|publisher=Glasgow, Brook &amp; Company|location=Toronto|year=1914|pages=936–958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Point "B" {{convert|72|nmi|mi km}} to the east.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Alaska Boundary|last=Davidson|first=George|publisher=Alaska Packers Association|location=San Francisco|year=1903|pages=79–81, 129–134, 177–179, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada relies on the "A-B" Line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as Canadian internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the "A-B" Line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance,&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; with Canada's land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial sea throughout Dixon Entrance.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; This territory, which surrounds Nunez Rocks, extends south of the "A-B" line for the most part.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; The United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea Treaty]], although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Another disputed area is the Grey Zone, including [[Machias Seal Island]], in the Gulf of Maine.

The [[Aroostook Valley Country Club]] is a [[golf course]] which straddles the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], between the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]]. The club, located near [[Perth-Andover]], New Brunswick and [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], has its course (except part of the tee area for the ninth hole, and possibly part of a sand trap on the first hole) and clubhouse on the Canadian side of the border and its parking lot and pro shop on the American side.&lt;ref name="clui"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-0 |title=Chapter 1: Eastern Maine |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]], shifts in the course of the lower Rio Grande have created numerous [[wikt:pene-exclave|pene-exclave]]s. Under the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] and earlier treaties, the United States and Mexico have maintained the actual course of the river as the international boundary, but both must approve proposed changes. From 1989 to 2009, there were 128 locations where the river changed course, causing land that had been on one side of the river to then occupy the opposite bank. Until the boundary is officially changed, there are 60 small pene-exclaves of the state of [[Texas]] now lying on the southern side of the river, as well as 68 such pene-exclaves of Mexico on the northern side of the river.

=== Russia ===
The legal status of the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement|US-Russian border]] is unclear. The United States Senate ratified a treaty setting the boundary with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. However, shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the [[Russian parliament]] never voted on the treaty.

=== Cuba ===
The boundary between the United States and Cuba is a maritime boundary along the [[Straits of Florida]]. Despite tense relations between the countries, the United States operates a military base in Cuba, [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The land on which this military base sits is not sovereign United States territory; rather, it is leased from the Cuban Government.

==States==

=== Separated by the water ===

*[[Rosecrans Memorial Airport]], though lying within the city limits of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], is inaccessible by land from Missouri due to a change in the course of the [[Missouri River]] following the [[Great Flood of 1951]]. It is accessible only by crossing the river, then turning north through [[Elwood, Kansas]].
*[[Delaware]] has two [[exclaves]] of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of [[Delaware Bay]] northwest of [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott State Park]] and [[Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge]]: [[Finns Point]] and [[Artificial Island, Delaware]] near the [[Salem Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. At that point, the border runs along New Jersey's mean [[Low-tide elevation|low-tide mark]]. Thus when the spoils from the navigational [[dredging]] of the bay were dumped alongside Fort Mott and the Salem plant excavations nearby, both sites became part of [[New Castle County, Delaware]].
*Iowa's city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa|Carter Lake]] on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.
*Several small areas of western Kentucky lie north of the [[Ohio River]] on what is otherwise the Indiana side, including one area south of [[Evansville, Indiana]] that accommodates [[Ellis Park Race Course|a horse racing track]].
*Several portions of Nebraska lie east of the [[Missouri River]], mainly due to flooding and changes in the river's path:
**[[DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge]] near Blair, which borders Iowa. A portion of Iowa is also on the Nebraska side in the same area.
**[[McKissick Island]] near Peru, which borders Missouri.
**A section of land that borders Iowa, [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]].
**Onawa Materials Yard Wildlife Area and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Management Area near [[Onawa, Iowa]].
*[[Newport County, Rhode Island]] is separated from the rest of the state by the delta of the [[Taunton River]]. The only land connection is through [[Massachusetts]]
*The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is separated by the Chesapeake Bay from the rest of the Commonwealth.
*Divided coastal islands:
** Rhode Island and Connecticut share [[Sandy Point Island]] in [[Little Narragansett Bay]].
** New Jersey and New York share [[Shooter's Island]], a bird sanctuary located in the south end of [[Newark Bay]] off the north shore of [[Staten Island]]. (The small portion in New Jersey is further divided between two counties.)
** Delaware and Maryland share [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]].
** Maryland and Virginia share [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]], as well as [[Assateague Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Virginia and North Carolina share [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]], [[Mon Island, North Carolina|Mon Island]] and [[Simon Island, Virginia|Simon Island]], separated from the Atlantic by an intracoastal waterway.

==== Separated by the Mississippi River ====
These border irregularities were caused by changes in the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]] or other river changes:

*Over a period of about 24 hours on 7 March 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that defined the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Tennessee's [[Reverie, Tennessee|Reverie]] and [[Corona, Tennessee|Corona]], located in [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] north-northwest of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | title = Tipton | work = Tennessee History for Kids | date = 2010-01-18 | publisher = Tennessee History for Kids | location = [[Nashville, Tennessee]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706152404/http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | archivedate = 2010-07-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other irregularities involving the [[Mississippi River]]: 
*Arkansas has territory at {{coord|35.65|N|89.87|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} across the Mississippi River on the northwest edge of Tennessee's [[Fort Pillow State Park]], north of the Corona/Reverie, Tennessee irregularity (mentioned in the previous section).
*Illinois's [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], Missouri's [[Grand Tower Island]] and other Illinois and Missouri territory on each other's side of the Mississippi River.
*The [[Kentucky Bend]] between Missouri and Tennessee.
*The state of [[Mississippi]] controls at least 11 exclaves on the west bank of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], while Louisiana owns 8 exclaves on Mississippi's side.
*Louisiana and Mississippi also share 3 islands, at 31.754078 degrees north, 91.376270 west; 31.885015 north, 91.228315 west; as well as [[Middle Ground Island]], Togo Island, Davis Island at {{coord|32.13|N|91.05|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, an island at {{coord|32.371|N|90.889|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Stack Island at {{coord|32.824|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Cottonwood Island at {{coord|32.651|N|91.157|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, and an island at {{coord|32.674|N|91.147|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas share an island at their tri-point at {{coord|33.006|N|91.169|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi also owns 14 exclaves on the bank in [[Arkansas]], while Arkansas has 15 of its own on Mississippi's side.
*Arkansas and Mississippi share islands at {{coord|34.895|N|90.268|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.229|N|90.847|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.829|N|90.431|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.177|N|90.885|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.732|N|91.142|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.142|N|91.092|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.129|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.235|N|91.098|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.358|N|91.118|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.393|N|91.106|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.408|N|91.124|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.498|N|91.176|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.569|N|91.171|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.757|N|91.117|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.247|N|90.922|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.297|N|90.743|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.679|N|90.566|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.847|N|90.388|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.888|N|90.284|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.025|N|90.252|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.039|N|90.208|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} and {{coord|33.382|N|91.116|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*There are also many irregularities along the river between Arkansas/Tennessee, Missouri/Tennessee, and Missouri/Kentucky.

=== Other irregularities ===

*[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] is surrounded by the states of [[Virginia]] (on its southwest side) and [[Maryland]] (on its southeast, northeast, and northwest sides); it interrupts those states' common border, which is the south shore of the [[Potomac River]] both upstream and downstream from the District. The portion of the Potomac River that passes Washington is virtually entirely within the District's border, as the District extends to the south bank.
*The [[Wedge (border)|Delaware Wedge]] adjacent to Maryland and Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url = http://chriswhong.com/mdbounds/ | title = The Boundary Disputes of Colonial Maryland | first = Christopher M. | last = Whong | date = 2000-12-11 | location = [[Baltimore, Maryland]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Erie Triangle]].
*Michigan's [[Lost Peninsula]] Marina and neighboring [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Washington Township, Lucas County, Ohio]]; resulting from [[Monroe County, Michigan#Border disputes|Toledo War border realignment]].
*Massachusetts's [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick Jog]].
*Missouri's [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]].
*The above-water portion of [[Liberty Island]] is part of [[New York State]], but being located in [[New York Bay]], is entirely surrounded by the waters of [[New Jersey]]. Ellis Island is also in the waters of New Jersey, but the naturally formed part of the island belongs to New York, while the artificial infill portion surrounding it belongs to New Jersey. The original land area of Ellis Island is a true exclave of New York State.

==Highway system irregularities==
*[[Oklahoma State Highway 20]] forms a concurrency with [[Arkansas Highway 43]] between [[Maysville, Arkansas]] and the [[Missouri]] state line, where AR-43 becomes [[Missouri Highway 43]].
*[[Interstate 24]] briefly enters [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a few miles but comes back into [[Tennessee]], and retains Tennessee exit numbers, but not Tennessee mile markers.
*[[Minnesota State Highway 23]] enters [[Wisconsin]] near [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] for half a mile.
*[[Interstate 684]], otherwise in New York, takes a shortcut across the northwest corner of the [[Connecticut Panhandle]] without any exits or signage save a standard Connecticut sign welcoming travelers to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].
*[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]], formerly [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]], drops just south of the [[New York-Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] for two miles between [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]] and [[Sayre, Pennsylvania|Sayre]]. The crossing is indicated by signs in both directions, but the New York signage and exit numbering remain (prior to being converted to an interstate, Route 17's sequential exit numbering began at its Pennsylvania terminus and continued into New York, one of the few highways in the U.S. where this was so; however, it is not uncommon for state highways to retain their route numbers when they change state highway shields at the border).
*[[New York State Route 120A]] runs along the Connecticut state line for much of its length, apart from 3.6 miles that enter the state, yet retains its New York signage and is still maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].
*Montana State Highway 43 runs for approximately one mile inside Idaho, between [[Chief Joseph Pass]] and [[Lost Trail Pass]]. It crosses into Montana again just yards from its junction with [[US 93]].
*The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carries [[I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] (the Capitol Beltway) across the [[Potomac River]] south of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. It connects [[Maryland]] on the east shore of the river with [[Virginia]] on the west shore. However, a few hundred feet of roadway close to the Virginia side crosses the southernmost point of the District of Columbia and thus is in neither Maryland nor Virginia.
*13 miles of [[Pennsylvania Route 426]] goes through [[New York (state)|New York]], though unlike other state highways on the list that briefly enter other states with their normal symbols, this one is badged as [[New York State Route 426]] between both borders of [[Pennsylvania]].
*Highways [[U.S. Route 2|US-2]] and [[U.S. Route 141|US-141]] run in the state of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] twice nonconsecutively.

===Highway exclaves===
Some highways are not connected to the rest of their nominal highway systems:
*In addition to Alaska and Hawaii being separated from the [[Contiguous United States|Lower 48]], each has discontinuous road systems that are internally isolated. [[Alaska Route 7]] and the other roads near [[Juneau, Alaska]] remain separated by [[ferry]] from other road systems.
*[[Abbott Drive|Iowa Highway 165]] in Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only state highway in Iowa to be entirely west of the [[Missouri River]]. The highway is the middle span of the [[Omaha, Nebraska]] road named [[Abbott Drive]], and is not directly connected to any other street. The rest of Carter Lake is a separate street system exclave accessible only from Locust Street or Avenue H in Omaha.
*In [[Atchison County, Missouri]], [[Missouri supplemental route]] V is separated from the rest of Missouri's highway system. It connects only to roads in [[Fremont County, Iowa]]. This is due to lying northwest of the [[Nishnabotna River]].
*[[New York State Route 171]], near [[Utica, New York|Utica]], does not intersect any other state highways (it once did, with [[New York State Route 5S|NY 5S]], but a realignment of that route took it away from the one intersection that NY 171 had).
*[[New Jersey Route 324]] is an isolated route in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]] that connects to the former docks of a ferry on the [[Delaware River]] carrying [[US Route 322]] to [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. The ferry was replaced by the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] in 1974. Route 324 used to connect to [[New Jersey Route 44]] at its eastern end prior to a realignment.
*A [[Pond Eddy Bridge|bridge]] connecting to [[Pond Eddy, Pennsylvania]] across the Delaware River to New York State is owned by Pennsylvania, despite having no connection to the rest of Pennsylvania's road network. One must use [[New York Route 97]] to cross back over the river at [[Narrowsburg, New York]] or [[Port Jervis, New York]], a distance of approximately {{convert|14|mi}}. When the original bridge needed replacement, Pennsylvania had considered buying out the property owners and demolishing the town and the bridge. (Bridges over the Delaware River between the two states are maintained by a joint commission&lt;!--The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission is a compact between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York is not involved in it at all.--&gt; operated by the transportation departments of both states.)
*County Highway 330 services [[Angle Inlet, Minnesota]]. It does not connect to any U.S. highway, rather connecting to [[Manitoba Provincial Road 525|Provincial Road 525]] in [[Manitoba|Manitoba, Canada]].
*[[M-185 (Michigan highway)|M-185]] in [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Michigan]] serves as a beltway around the island, and is the only highway in the U.S. that bans cars and only allows runners and [[Cycling|bicyclists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/expo/erry-2018/03/797a7e7b1b/a_guide_to_michigans_m185_the.html|title=A guide to Michigan's M-185, the only U.S. highway where cars are banned|work=MLive.com|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not connect to any other highway, and the only way to access it or the island are via [[ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mackinacisland.org/stay/getting-here/|title=Directions, Mackinac Island, MI - Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|work=Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[St. Clair County, Michigan]], highway [[M-154 (Michigan highway)|M-154]] runs on [[Harsens Island]], although it does connect via ferry to nearby highway [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Chorobates''', described by [[Vitruvius]] in Book VII of the [[De architectura|Architecture]], was used to measure horizontal planes and was especially important in the construction of aqueducts.

Similar to modern [[spirit level]]s, the Chorobates consisted of a beam of wood 6 m in length held by 2 supporting legs and equipped with 2 plumb lines at each end. The legs were joined to the beam by two diagonal rods with carved notches.  If the notches corresponding to the plumb lines matched on both sides, it showed that the beam was level. On top of the beam, a groove or channel was carved.  If the condition was too windy for the plumb bobs to work effectively, the surveyor could pour water into the groove and measure the plane by checking the water level.

'''Collier Hills''' is a residential neighborhood in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  The area gets its name from the [[List_of_United_States_political_families_(C)|family]] whose homestead was broadly located in the southwest corner of the intersection of Peachtree St. and Collier Rd.  Andrew Jackson Collier, a member of this family and early pioneer of the area, operated an antebellum grist mill off Tanyard Creek, near Collier Rd.&lt;ref&gt;Buckhead Neighborhoods' History: http://buckhead.net/collier-hills/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Contarini–Rosselli map''' of 1506 was the first printed world map showing the New World. 

The Contarini–Rosselli map was designed by [[Giovanni Matteo Contarini]] and engraved by [[Francesco Rosselli]]. It is a copper-engraved map and was published in [[Venice]] or [[Florence]] in 1506. The only surviving copy is in the [[British Library]].

==Age of discovery==
There had been many voyages of discovery in the immediately preceding years:
* [[Bartolomeu Dias|Dias]]’ rounding of Africa (1487)
* the discovery of Newfoundland by [[John Cabot]] (1497)
* [[Vasco da Gama]]’s travel to India (1499)
* the explorations of the Caribbean and South America by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (1492–93, 1493–94, 1498, 1502–04)
* visits to the Caribbean and South America by [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] (1499, 1501–02)

Although there had been maps created after these voyages, such as [[Juan de la Cosa]]’s map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus' second voyage) and the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino]] world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely guarded. These maps were commissioned by the Portuguese and Spanish governments, which wanted to create trade monopolies over the regions they depicted. The royal powers worried that leaked information about geography could make it easier for other nations to challenge their supremacy. Often a limited number of copies was made, to be held under lock and key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5nMCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=dBQgeFwBui&amp;dq=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;f=false|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2015-06-22|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226255316|location=|pages=60-62|language=en|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicizing the shape of the world ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
This situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The [[Contarini-Rosselli]] map of 1506 (now in the [[British Library]]) and [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of the world and globe of 1507 were influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. 

By contrast, [[Johannes Ruysch]]'s 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence.

'''Distances Between Ports''' (PUB 151) is a publication that lists the distances between major ports. Reciprocal distances between two ports may differ due to the different routes of currents and climatic conditions chosen. To reduce the number of listings
needed, junction points along major routes are used to consolidate routes converging from different directions.

This book can be most effectively used for [[passage planning|voyage planning]] in conjunction with the proper volume(s) of the [[Sailing Directions|Sailing Directions (Planning Guide)]]. It is corrected via the [[Notice to Mariners]].

The positions listed for ports are central positions that most represent each port. The distances are between positions shown for each port and are generally over routes that afford the safest passage. Most of the distances represent the shortest navigable routes, but in some cases, longer routes, that take advantage of favorable currents, have been used. In other cases, increased distances result from routes selected to avoid ice or other dangers to navigation, or to follow required separation schemes.

'''EUROGEO''' is a European scientific society, which networks [[geographer]]s. It is an international [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] organisation. Since 1987 EUROGEO has been a participative member of the Conference of International NGOs of the Council of Europe. The association is involved in national and international activities and projects in geography including those related to education and training. It is a not profit organisation, which aims to develop, support and promote policies designed to advance the status of geography; establish and promote cross-border cooperation; promote education and training in geography from a European perspective and represent nationally and internationally the views of its members.

EUROGEO activities include organising events, producing publications, supporting geographers in their jobs and careers, the teaching of geographical sciences, identifying and promoting good practise, co-operating with the European Union, Council of Europe, European Commission and other relevant organisations; lobbying at global, European and where relevant national level, providing a forum for the discussion of matters of common interest to geographers, giving advice on geography and making recommendations to policy makers.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
EUROGEO was first established in 1979 under the name of European Standing Conference of Geography Teachers Association (ESCGTA). In the beginning it was an association of associations. In 1994, when other European countries became members, the association took the name of its bulletin, EUROGEO: European Network of Geography Teachers´ Associations. The principal aims of that organisation were to advise and promote the European dimension in geographical education and teaching about the countries of Europe as a contribution towards the development of a European dimension in education. Members were geography teacher associations and geographical associations from around Europe. Presidents of these associations or their representatives attended the bi-annual meetings that were originally organised and funded by the [[European Commission]] in Brussels.

=== First activities ===
EUROGEO was led by a small committee of volunteers headed by Henk Meier representing the Dutch Geographical Association (KNAG). In between each of these conferences a EUROGEO bulletin was published.

=== Twentieth century ===
In 1987 EUROGEO applied for and was accepted as an international NGO with representation at the [[Council of Europe]]. Since this time representatives from the association have participated in NGO meetings in [[Strasbourg]], being the voice of geography and geographers there. In 2003 the status of EUROGEO, along with other NGOs, was reviewed and the association became a fully participating NGO at the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.coe.int/t/ngo/|website=Conference of INGOs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 a successful application was made by EUROGEO for a European Minerva Project (Euro.Geo) to produce materials that promote [[European citizen]]ship through the use of ICT in teaching geography in school education. The project was coordinated by Karl Donert at Liverpool Hope University.

At the Liverpool meeting of EUROGEO in 2001, members of the association decided to apply for a project to share news and information about the state and status of Geography in Europe. The project produced a Web site, interactive maps of Europe as well as teaching and training resources in different languages.

Henk Meijer decided to stand down and in 2002 and during the EUROGEO Annual meeting held in Madeira, Portugal at elections for new Presidium Karl Donert was elected President of the association.

=== Twenty-first century: Networking: the HERODOT Network for Geography in higher education and teacher training ===
In 2002, the proposal to establish a [[Socrates-Erasmus]] Thematic Network project on university Geography and the Bologna Process funded by the European Commission was successful. This was the HERODOT Network for Geography in Higher Education. This thematic network was coordinated by Liverpool Hope University and led by Karl Donert. HERODOT sought to improve the quality of learning and teaching in [[higher education]] and [[teacher training]] and address issues raised by the [[Bologna Process]] like quality assurance, the use of new technologies and research in geographical education.

There were two phases of the project that ran from 2002–2005 and 2006–2009. A large number of publications were produced and many events were held around Europe dealing with issues relating to Geography in higher education and teacher training. Members of EUROGEO participated in the funded network. Under HERODOT, Geography became a subject assessed under the project Tuning Educational Structures in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuningacademy.org/herodot-geography-2003-2010/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009 HERODOT had connected more than 300 organizations throughout all European countries and 60 partners from other countries around the world. These partners joined HERODOT meetings and workshops to share their ideas, innovations and best practice online and face-to-face. The broad partnership of the network included universities and research centres, companies and NGOs as well as teacher training and other education bodies like Ministries of Education. Many of those who participated in the work of HERODOT are still actively collaborating in follow up activities, project and meetings.

The idea to establish a European Geography association that supported not only teachers and educators, but also geographers working in other professions came as a result of the discussions that took place at several Herodot meetings.

At the annual meeting of EUROGEO in Liverpool in September 2008, member associations unanimously agreed to change the legal status and remit of the association. This was presented to HERODOT partners, after which members of the EUROGEO Presidium and the HERODOT Core Group held a joint meeting to form a working group to restructure the association as a membership organisation.

After lengthy discussions both organisations held a joint meeting in [[Ayvalik]], [[Turkey]] in June 2009, where the new EUROGEO association held its first elections and passed its revised statutes. Karl Donert was then elected president of EUROGEO. This was the final meeting of the HERODOT network. The new, restructured organisation now deals with educational, scientific, research and applied parts of Geography with a European perspective.

EUROGEO cooperates with many other international institutions and associations including the [[Association of American Geographers|AAG]], SEAGA and the International Geographical Union  ([[International Geographical Union|IGU]]) and is a stakeholder organisation in the [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], EyeonEarth and "Geo for All" initiatives.

== Membership ==
EUROGEO members are geographers and related professionals who work in the public, private, and academic sectors. They work in a wide range of careers, as teachers and trainers, state and local government employees, planners, cartographers, scientists, non-profit workers, entrepreneurs, business people, graduate students, retirees, and university administrators.

There are three categories of membership:
#  Individual members
#  Organisational members
#  Young members including EGEA (European Association of Young Geographers)

== Publications ==
EUROGEO has published a large number of books, articles, magazines and conference proceedings and the society has developed the European Journal of Geography. The European Journal of Geography published its first issue in 2010 and since then has regularly produced issues and widely cited articles on geographical themes relevant to the activities of the association. In February 2014 the European Journal of Geography was accepted and indexed in [[Scopus]].

EUROGEO is associated with the geography education journal, the Review of International Geographical Education Online, which developed as an initiative from HERODOT members.

== Recent projects ==
EUROGEO regularly applies for new projects, currently under the Erasmus +, Jean Monnet, Citizenship and [[Horizon 2020]] Programmes. 

Since 2009, the number of innovative geographical projects EUROGEO has been involved in has increased. Four types of projects have been developed and supported i) networks, ii) multilateral projects iii) awareness raising and iv) support for associations.

EUROGEO has been responsible for the creation of networks of academics and educators on specific priority themes, such as the digitalearth.eu: geomedia in schools network (Lifelong Learning Programme), where a number of Digital Earth Centres of Excellence were accredited, and since 2013, the School on the Cloud network: connecting education to the Cloud for digital citizenship.
 
EUROGEO has participated in a large number of multi-lateral education development projects. These have established training of teachers and educators in important geographical areas, such as GIS (the iGuess and iGuess 2 Projects), data and statistics in schools (the I-Use Project) and more recently powerful disciplinary knowledge (the GeoCapabilities project).

[[File:GeoCapabilities-02 1cm.jpg|thumb|GeoCapabilities project logo]]  
GeoCapabilities is a 3-year project with a key objective to create teacher training materials to develop teachers as curriculum leaders through a [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]]. The project embraces diversity in culture and language and in how geography is understood and expressed in national school standards. The project believes that a capabilities approach helps geography educators in all jurisdictions articulate the relevance and power of learning how to think geographically. The key output is "to develop and pilot an online professional development communications platform for teacher preparation in geography." This includes resources (teaching materials and communications tools), international collaboration and online teacher exchanges.
 
EUROGEO participates in the SeaChange Horizon 2020 Project, raising awareness of the importance of Ocean Literacy. The project aims to establish a fundamental "Sea Change" in the way European citizens view their relationship with the sea, by empowering them, as Ocean Literate citizens, to take direct and sustainable action towards a healthy ocean and seas, healthy communities and ultimately a healthy planet.
 
EUROGEO has been coordinating since 2016 the YouthMetre Forward Looking Project that addresses EU Youth Priority 7 "Using e-participation as an instrument to foster young people's empowerment and active participation in democratic life". The aim is to empower young people to become engaged and affect EU youth policy. An e-tool will be produced to close the gap between youth and institutions by collecting the perceived needs of youth in key policy areas and providing guidelines to public institutions that help address them. Through training YouthMetre will provide youngsters with necessary skills and knowledge to foster effective implementation by policy makers of the guidelines provided by the "Youthmetre".

In 2013 EUROGEO was awarded a Jean Monnet grant for pan-European associations.

[[File:Echo Sounding USN.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of echo sounding using a multibeam echosounder.]]'''Echo sounding''' is a type of [[sonar]] used to determine the depth of water by transmitting sound waves into water. The time interval between emission and return of a pulse is recorded, which is used to determine the depth of water along with the speed of sound in water at the time. This information is then typically used for navigation purposes or in order to obtain depths for charting purposes.  Echo sounding can also refer to hydroacoustic "echo sounders" defined as active sound in water (sonar) used to study fish. Hydroacoustic assessments have traditionally employed mobile surveys from boats to evaluate fish biomass and spatial distributions. Conversely, fixed-location techniques use stationary transducers to monitor passing fish.

The word ''[[Depth sounding|sounding]]'' is used for all types of depth measurements, including those that don't use [[sound]], and is unrelated in origin to the word ''sound'' in the sense of noise or tones. Echo sounding is a more rapid method of measuring depth than the previous technique of lowering a [[sounding line]] until it touched bottom.

==Technique==
[[File:Principle of SBES.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the basic principle of echo sounding]]
Distance is measured by multiplying half the time from the signal's outgoing pulse to its return by the [[speed of sound]] in the [[water]], which is approximately 1.5 kilometres per second [T÷2×(4700 feet per second or 1.5 kil per second )] For precise applications of echosounding, such as [[hydrography]], the speed of sound must also be measured typically by deploying a [[sound velocity probe]] into the water.  Echo sounding is effectively a special purpose application of [[sonar]] used to locate the bottom. Since a traditional pre-SI unit of water depth was the [[fathom]], an instrument used for determining water depth is sometimes called a ''fathometer''.
The first practical fathometer was invented by [[Herbert Grove Dorsey]] and patented in 1928.&lt;ref name=NOAAhistory&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/poletobeam2.html |title=Echo Sounding /  Early Sound Methods |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2006|website=National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  |publisher= NOAA Central Library|access-date= |quote=In answer to the need for a more accurate depth registering device, Dr. Herbert Grove Dorsey, who later joined the C&amp;GS, devised a visual indicating device for measuring relatively short time intervals and by which shoal and deep depths could be registered. In 1925, the C&amp;GS obtained the very first Fathometer, designed and built by the Submarine Signal Company.}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Most charted [[ocean]] depths use an average or standard sound speed. Where greater accuracy is required average and even seasonal standards may be applied to ocean regions. For high accuracy depths, usually restricted to special purpose or scientific surveys, a sensor may be lowered to measure the temperature, pressure and salinity. These factors are used to calculate the actual [[sound speed]] in the local water column.  This latter technique is regularly used by US Office of Coast Survey for navigational surveys of US coastal waters. See NOAA Field Procedures Manual, Office of Coast Survey website (http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/fpm/fpm.htm).

==Common use==
As well as an aid to navigation (most larger vessels will have at least a simple depth sounder), echo sounding is commonly used for [[fishing]].  Variations in elevation often represent places where fish congregate.  Schools of fish will also register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fischfinder-echolot.com/|title=Fishfinders Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fishfinder]] is an echo sounding device used by both recreational and commercial fishers. 

== Hydrography==
In areas where detailed [[bathymetry]] is required, a precise echo sounder may be used for the work of hydrography.  There are many considerations when evaluating such a system, not limited to the vertical accuracy, resolution, acoustic beamwidth of the transmit/receive beam and the acoustic [[frequency]] of the [[transducer]]. 
 
[[File:Odom Mk3 Echosounder.jpg|thumb|An example of a precision dual frequency echosounder, the Teledyne Odom MkIII]]

The majority of hydrographic echosounders are dual frequency, meaning that a low frequency pulse (typically around 24&amp;nbsp;kHz) can be transmitted at the same time as a high frequency pulse (typically around 200&amp;nbsp;kHz).  As the two frequencies are discrete, the two return signals do not typically interfere with each other.  There are many advantages of dual frequency echosounding, including the ability to identify a vegetation layer or a layer of soft mud on top of a layer of rock.  

[[File:DF SBES Wiki.jpg|thumb|A screen grab of the difference between single and dual frequency echograms]]

Most hydrographic operations use a 200&amp;nbsp;kHz transducer, which is suitable for inshore work up to 100 metres in depth.  Deeper water requires a lower frequency transducer as the acoustic signal of lower frequencies is less susceptible to attenuation in the water column.  Commonly used frequencies for deep water sounding are 33&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz.  

The beamwidth of the transducer is also a consideration for the hydrographer, as to obtain the best [[Sensor resolution|resolution]] of the data gathered a narrow beamwidth is preferable.  This is especially important when sounding in deep water, as the resulting footprint of the acoustic pulse can be very large once it reaches a distant sea floor.  

In addition to the single beam echo sounder, there are echo sounders that are capable of receiving many return "pings".  These systems are detailed further in the section called [[multibeam echosounder]].

Echo sounders are used in laboratory applications to monitor sediment transport, scour and erosion processes in scale models (hydraulic models, flumes etc.). These can also be used to create plots of 3D contours.

===Standards for hydrographic echo sounding===

The required precision and accuracy of the hydrographic echo sounder is defined by the requirements of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) for surveys that are to be undertaken to IHO standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Hydrographic Bureau|title=IHO Standards for Hydrographic Surveys|date=February 2008|issue=5th Edition|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-44_5E.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008191705/http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-44_5E.pdf|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These values are contained within IHO publication S44.  

In order to meet these standards, the surveyor must consider not only the vertical and horizontal accuracy of the echo sounder and transducer, but the survey system as a whole.  A motion sensor may be used, specifically the heave component (in single beam echosounding) to reduce soundings for the motion of the vessel experienced on the water's surface.  Once all of the uncertainties of each sensor are established, the hydrographer will create an [[uncertainty budget]] to determine whether the survey system meets the requirements laid down by IHO.

Different hydrographic organisations will have their own set of field procedures and manuals to guide their surveyors to meet the required standards.  Two examples are the US Army Corps of Engineers publication EM110-2-1003,&lt;ref name="USACE Hydrographic Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-manuals/em1110-2-1003/toc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720182750/http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-manuals/em1110-2-1003/toc.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, USACE publication EM 1110-2-1003.&lt;/ref&gt; and the NOAA 'Field Procedures Manual'.&lt;ref name="NOAA Field Procedures Manual"&gt;[http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/docs/Field_Procedures_Manual_May_2011.pdf], NOAA Field Procedures Manual.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

German inventor [[Alexander Behm]] was granted German [[patent]] No. 282009 for the invention of echo sounding ''(device for measuring depths of the sea and distances and headings of ships or obstacles by means of reflected sound waves)'' on 22 July 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Al4uqB66KUC&amp;pg=SA3-PA61&amp;lpg=SA3-PA61&amp;dq=alexander+behm+echo+sounding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8kwfQjlX2r&amp;sig=FNlDXtWVEDE-74LL0tz-H6LvS0Q&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aY5EU-6dC4rsswa1joDACA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=alexander%20behm%20echo%20sounding&amp;f=false | title=Radio Propagation Measurement and Channel Modelling | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | author=Salous, Sana | year=2013 | pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFMQd__GtSMC&amp;dq=alexander+behm+inventor+echo+sounding&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Sciences of Geodesy - I: Advances and Future Directions | publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] | author=Xu, Guochang | year=2010 | pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alexander-behm-echolot.de/ | title=Alexander Behm - Der Erfinder des Echolots | accessdate=9 April 2014 | author=Werner Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commercial echo sounding units was the Fessenden Fathometer, which used the [[Fessenden oscillator]] to generate sound waves. This was first installed by the Submarine Signal Company in 1924 on the M&amp;M liner S.S. Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fessenden Fathometer amplifier - Submarine Signal Company|url=https://www.subchaser.org/fathometer|website=The Subchaser Archives|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eye2eye Software Ltd''' is a UK educational software publisher, which has systematically photographed Britain in 360 degree panoramas and stills, publishing the collection as the school resource and home reference '''''Eye2eye Britain'''''. Using a portable panoramic camera developed by themselves they have followed a 'points of interest' approach--taking panoramas on mountains, beaches, inside parliaments, factories, heritage sites, etc. rather than a street (car) based approach like [[Google street view]].&lt;ref name=eye2eyews&gt;[http://www.eye2eyesoft.co.uk Eye2eye Software Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eye2eye Software Ltd, based in Cambridge, England, was founded in 1998 by Martin Clemoes, son of the late [[Peter Clemoes]]. Eye2eye Britain may have been partly inspired by 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]] developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] where Martin worked before.

November 1998 - first edition of Eye2eye Britain (1.0) published. Supplied on CD-ROM, this mapped out Britain in 10,000 digital photos (no panoramas). Each photo is captioned and indexed using metadata, e.g. topic, date of heritage sites on a timeline, as well as map location.

1999 - Press interest in Eye2eye Britain.
* The Guardian started an article ''CoastBusters''&lt;ref&gt;Newnham, D: ''Coastbusters'', The Guardian, 20 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with the line "Ever had an urge to explore the entire coastline of mainland Britain? Put away that sou'wester and boot up your PC instead. For a round trip from John O'Groats to John O'Groats, its not rainwear you need, but software."
* Personal Computer World subtitled a review&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, N: ''Eye2eye Britain'', Personal Computer World, July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with "A hugely impressive reference work that focuses on places of note in the British Isles".

January 2005 - First Panoramic Edition of Eye2eye Britain published. Added 950 full screen 360 by 105 degree panoramas, of England from Leeds in Yorkshire South, to 10,000 photos.

2005-06 - Consumer press critical, better feedback for education.
* Before 2007 launch of [[Google street view]], consumer press did not see appeal of exploring with panoramas - e.g. 5 May Computer Shopper review&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, M: ''Eye2eye Britain - Panorama Edition'', Computer Shopper, 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ending with "As no information is provided for people who want to visit the places featured in Eye2eye Britain, it's more suitable as an educational product than for use by day-trippers or holiday-makers."
* With whiteboards becoming widely used in UK schools, education press more enthusiastic, e.g. in 6 December Education Guardian article called ''Bring maps to life and save the world''.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, A: ''Bring maps to life and save the world'', Education Guardian, 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2010 - Latest edition - Eye2eye Britain Panoramic 5 - published. 1,500 panoramas and 10,800 photos now cover mainland England, Wales and Scotland plus the largest of Britain's many islands.&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt; Edition 5 also supports other school needs such as [[Virtual learning environment]].

==Panorama technology==
Eye2eye's approach to panoramic photography depends on two technologies they have developed themselves:&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt;
# A portable panoramic camera system capturing a 360 by 105 degree  panorama in a single click.
# Panorama rendering software for the PC that syncs with screen refresh, rendering a perspective view frame for each screen refresh (e.g. 60 frames per second) for smooth panorama movement.

This technology has shaped their approach to panorama-photographing Britain. They have used their portable camera system to capture points of interest panoramas on foot, e.g. interiors, beaches, tower-top or mountain-top views. Single-click capture copes well with places with movement, e.g. crowds, waves on beach. This approach has the advantage of covering places of [inter]national interest, but the disadvantage of being labour-intensive, so the quantity of panoramas (currently around 1,500) is less than in car-based projects like [[Google Street View]]. Eye2eye have also been able to write captions and indexes for each panorama.

[[File:IOM ET GENI LOCI.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Votive inscription to [[:en:Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] and the ''Genius loci'' by the [[Signifer]] of [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]] on behalf himself and his own legion during the consulate of Maternus and Atticus (185 AD)]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|classical Roman religion]], a '''''[[genius (mythology)|genius]] loci''''' ([[plural]] ''genii loci'') was the protective spirit of a place. It was often depicted in religious iconography as a figure holding attributes such as a [[cornucopia]], [[patera]] ([[libation]] bowl) or [[Serpent (symbolism)|snake]]. Many Roman altars found throughout the [[Western Roman Empire]] were dedicated to a particular ''genius locus''. The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cults of the Emperor]] and the imperial house developed in part in connections with the sacrifices made by neighborhood associations ''([[vicus|vici]])'' to the local ''genius''. These 265 local districts&lt;ref&gt;Number is for the city of Rome, cf. Plin. ''Nat. Hist.'' III, 66&lt;/ref&gt; had their cult organised around the ''Lares Compitales'' (guardian spirits or ''[[lares]]'' of the crossroads), which the emperor [[Augustus]] transformed into ''Lares Augusti'' along with the ''Genius Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Greg. (2008). "Divinity and Power in Ancient Rome" in ''Religion and Power: Divine Kingship in the Ancient World and Beyond''. Nicole Brisch (ed.)(Oriental Institute Seminars No. 4), Chicago: The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's ''genius'' is then regarded as the ''genius loci'' of the [[Roman Empire]] as a whole.

Roman examples of these Genii can be found, for example, at the [[Church (building)|church]] of St. Giles, [[Tockenham]], Wiltshire where the genius locus is depicted as a relief in the wall of a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church built of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] material. This shows "a youthful and curly-haired Roman Genius worked in high relief, holding a cornucopia in his left hand and a ''patera'' in his right", which previously has been "erroneously identified as [[Asclepius]]".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, J. M. C. (1978). "Two Romano-British Genii", in ''Britannia'', Vol. 9, p. 330. London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian usage==
The [[numen|numinous spirits]] of places in Asia are still honored today in [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]]s, outdoor [[spirit house]]s and indoor [[Shrine#Household shrines|household and business shrine]]s.

==Western usage==

In contemporary usage, ''genius loci'' usually refers to a location's distinctive atmosphere, or a "[[spirit of place]]", rather than necessarily a guardian spirit. An example of contemporary usage might be along the lines of "Light reveals the genius loci of a place."

==Art and architecture==
[[Alexander Pope]] made the Genius Loci an important principle in [[garden]] and landscape design with the following lines from ''Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Consult the genius of the place in all;
That tells the waters or to rise, or fall;
Or helps th' ambitious hill the heav'ns to scale,
Or scoops in circling theatres the vale;
Calls in the country, catches opening glades,
Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades,
Now breaks, or now directs, th' intending lines;
Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pope's verse laid the foundation for one of the most widely agreed principles of [[landscape architecture]]. This is the principle that landscape designs should ''always'' be adapted to the context in which they are located.

[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]], [[archetype]], and ''genius loci'' are the primary principals of Neo-Rationalism or New Rationalism. Pioneered by the Italian architect [[Aldo Rossi]], Neo-Rationalism developed in the light of a re-evaluation of the work of [[Giuseppe Terragni]], and gained momentum through the work of [[Giorgio Grassi]]. Characterized by elemental [[vernacular]] forms and an adaptation to the existing environment, the Neo-Rationalist style has adherents beyond architecture in the greater world of art.

In the context of modern architectural theory, ''genius loci'' has profound implications for place-making, falling within the philosophical branch of "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]". This field of architectural discourse is explored most notably by the theorist [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] in his book, ''Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture''.

==Modern fantasy==
In modern works of [[fantasy]], such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' or ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', a genius loci is an intelligent [[spirit]] or [[Magic (fantasy)|magical]] power that resides in a place. Very few genius loci of this form are able to move from their native area, either because they are "part of the land" or because they are bound to it. Genius loci are usually portrayed as being extremely powerful and usually also very intelligent, though there is a great deal of variability on these points. Some versions are nearly omnipotent and omniscient inside the area they inhabit, while others are simply vast, semi-sentient wellsprings of magical energy. This power almost never extends beyond the border of the genius loci.

Different settings give different explanations for the existence of genius loci. In most cases, however, the intelligent, magical entity simply develops from the similarly named "spirit of place" over a great deal of time. In other settings, genius loci are formed by powerful magical events, and in others they are the results of [[ley lines]], [[Mana#Mana in fantasy|mana pools]], or an equivalent.
&lt;!--
Note to any future editors: I don't have the expertise required to correctly comment this, so I'm going to leave it with the "citations needed" flag and simply list here a few probable good sources. These were my primary sources while writing this, but I've encountered genius loci in a number of other works (mostly short stories by various authors, although they're occasionally the monster of the week in epic fantasy novels).

Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 epic level handbook
''Turn Coat'': book 11 of ''The Dresden Files''

Most high fantasy settings that use a more literal hot-and-cold-running-mana system, as described in Niven's works, also sometimes feature intelligent mana pools. These share many similarities with genius loci even though they're not named as such. I haven't found any really good similar term/page for these (there isn't a mana pool page? Might have to create that), and I tend to conflate them anyway, so I've stuck a reference to intelligent mana pools in there.

In [[computing]], '''GeoServer''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] server written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that allows users to share, process and edit [[Geographic information system|geospatial data]]. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using [[open standard]]s.  GeoServer has evolved to become an easy method of connecting existing information to [[virtual globe]]s such as [[Google Earth]] and [[NASA World Wind]] as well as to web-based maps such as [[OpenLayers]], [[Google Maps]] and [[Bing Maps]].  GeoServer functions as the [[reference implementation]] of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] [[Web Feature Service]] standard, and also implements the [[Web Map Service]], [[Web Coverage Service]] and [[Web Processing Service]] specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
GeoServer aims to operate as a node within a free and open [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]].  Just as the [[Apache HTTP Server]] has offered a free and open web server to publish [[HTML]], GeoServer aims to do the same for geospatial data.

== Features ==
GeoServer reads a variety of data formats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/release/stable/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[PostGIS]]
* [[Oracle Spatial]]
* [[ArcSDE]]
* [[IBM DB2|DB2]]
* [[MySQL]]
* [[Shapefile]]s
* [[GeoTIFF]]
* [[GTOPO30]]
* [[ECW (file format)|ECW]], [[MrSID]]
* [[JPEG2000]]

Through standard protocols it produces [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[Geography Markup Language|GML]], Shapefile, [[GeoRSS]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[GeoJSON]], [[JPEG]], [[GIF]], [[SVG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and more. In addition, one can edit data via the [[Web Feature Service#Transactions|WFS transactional profile]] (WFS-T).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html|title=WFS reference — GeoServer 2.14.x User Manual|website=docs.geoserver.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GeoServer includes an integrated [[OpenLayers]] client for previewing data layers.

GeoServer additionally supports efficient publishing of geospatial data to [[Google Earth]] through the use of network links, using KML.  Advanced features for Google Earth output include templates for customized pop-ups, time and height visualizations, and "super-overlays".

GeoServer relies on [[GeoTools]], a [[geographic information system|GIS]] library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/about/|title=About - GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
GeoServer uses the [[Spring Framework]], providing a request dispatch architecture for modules implementing OGC services. The web administration application uses wicket, allowing extensions to contribute additional configuration screens. The application provides a REST API implemented using the [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].

GeoServer is a web application, supporting any common [[Java Servlet#Servlet containers|servlet container]] (a standalone distribution is available with the [[Jetty (web server)]] as an embedded server). [[GeoWebCache]], a Java-based caching component similar to [[TileCache]], is bundled with GeoServer, but available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geowebcache.org/trac |title=GeoWebCache |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405124130/http://geowebcache.org/trac |archivedate=2010-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GeoServer packages GeoTools as a Java library, but it is also available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geotools.org/|title=GeoTools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GeoServer is a longstanding application and has undergone several architectural changes. GeoServer 1.0 was built around the STRUTS framework, with the migration to Spring and Wicket taking place for GeoServer 2.0. Early versions of the REST API used restlet before migration to [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].

A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">'''Geovisualization''' or '''Geovisualisation''', short for ''Geographic Visualization'', refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of [[geospatial data]] through the use of [[interactive visualization]].

Like the related fields of [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"&gt;MacEachren, A.M. and Kraak, M.J. 1997 Exploratory cartographic visualization: advancing the agenda. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 23(4), pp. 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information visualization]] &lt;ref name= "Card99"&gt;[[Stuart K. Card]], Mackinlay, J.D., and Shneidermann, B. 1999. Reading in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kaumann Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"&gt;Jiang, B., and Li, Z. 2005. Editorial: Geovisualization: Design, Enhanced Visual Tools and Applications. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ME04"&gt;[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] 2004. Geovisualization for knowledge construction and decision support. IEEE computer graphics and applications, 24(1), pp.13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. [[GIS]] and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"&gt;Jiang, B., Huang, B., and Vasek, V. 2003. Geovisualisation for Planning Support Systems. In Planning Support Systems in Practice, Geertman, S., and Stillwell, J. (Eds.). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

==History==
The term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953, in an article by [[University of Chicago]] geographer Allen K. Philbrick. New developments in the field of computer science prompted the [[National Science Foundation]] to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, computer-aided design, signal processing, and user interface studies &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, B.H., DeFanti, T.A., and Brown, M.D. (Eds.). 1987. Visualization in Scientific Computing. Computer Graphics, 21(6). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

Geovisualization developed as a field of research in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of French graphic theorist [[Jacques Bertin]].&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt; Bertin’s work on cartographic design and information visualization share with the National Science Foundation report a focus on the potential for the use of “dynamic visual displays as prompts for scientific insight and on the methods through which dynamic visual displays might leverage perceptual cognitive processes to facilitate scientific thinking”.&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt;

Geovisualization has continued to grow as a subject of practice and research. The [[International Cartographic Association]] (ICA) established a Commission on Visualization &amp; Virtual Environments in 1995.

==Related Fields==
Geovisualization is closely related to other visualization fields, such as [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; and [[information visualization]].&lt;ref name= "Card99"/&gt; Owing to its roots in [[cartography]], geovisualization contributes to these other fields by way of the map metaphor, which “has been widely used to visualize non-geographic information in the domains of information visualization and [[domain knowledge]] visualization."&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"/&gt;  It is also related to [[UrbanSim|urban simulation]].

==Practical Applications==
Geovisualization has made inroads in a diverse set of real-world situations calling for the decision-making and knowledge creation processes it can provide. The following list provides a summary of some of these applications as they are discussed in the geovisualization literature.
E

=== Wildland fire fighting ===
Firefighters have been using sandbox environments to rapidly and physically model topography and fire for wildfire incident command strategic planning. The SimTable is a 3D interactive fire simulator, bringing sandtable exercises to life. The SimTable uses advanced computer simulations to model fires in any area, including local neighborhoods, utilizing actual slope, terrain, wind speed/direction, vegetation, and other factors. SimTable Models were used in Arizona's largest fire on record, the [[Wallow Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2149915.shtml?cat=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===
Geovisualizers, working with European foresters, used CommonGIS and Visualization Toolkit ([[VTK]]) to visualize a large set of spatio-temporal data related to European forests, allowing the data to be explored by non-experts over the Internet. The report summarizing this effort “uncovers a range of fundamental issues relevant to the broad field of geovisualization and information visualization research”.&lt;ref name= "GA07"&gt;Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Jankowski, P, Keim, D., Kraak, M.-J., MacEachren, A.M., and Wrobel, S. 2007. Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21(8), pp. 839-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team cited the two major problems as the inability of the geovisualizers to convince the foresters of the efficacy of geovisualization in their work and the foresters’ misgivings over the dataset’s accessibility to non-experts engaging in “uncontrolled exploration”. While the geovisualizers focused on the ability of geovisualization to aid in knowledge construction, the foresters preferred the information-communication role of more traditional forms of cartographic representation.&lt;ref name= "GA07"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
Geovisualization provides archaeologists with a potential technique for mapping unearthed archaeological environments  as well as for accessing and exploring archaeological data in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Geovisualization: an Example from the Catholme Ceremonial Complex. Archaeological Prospection, 13, pp. 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of geovisualization for archaeology are not limited to advances in archaeological theory and exploration but also include the development of new, collaborative relationships between archaeologists and computer scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Review of Exploring Geovisualization , Dykes, J., MacEachren, A.M., and Kraak, M.J. (Eds.). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, 2004. In Archaeological Prospection, 12, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Studies===
Geovisualization tools provide multiple stakeholders with the ability to make balanced environmental decisions by taking into account “the complex interacting factors that should be taken into account when studying environmental changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasco|first=Luis|last2=Asensio|first2=Cesar|last3=de Arcas|first3=Guillermo|date=2017-05-15|title=Communicating airport noise emission data to the general public|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303042|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=586|pages=836–848|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization users can use a [[georeference]]d model to explore a complex set of environmental data, interrogating a number of scenarios or policy options to determine a best fit.&lt;ref&gt;Danada, J., Dias, E., Romao, T., Correia, N., Trabuco, A., Santos, C., Serpa, J., Costa, M., Camara, A. 2005. Mobile Environmental Visualization. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban Planning===
Both planners and the general public can use geovisualization to explore real-world environments and model ‘what if’ scenarios based on spatio-temporal data. While geovisualization in the preceding fields may be divided into two separate domains—the private domain, in which professionals use geovisualization to explore data and generate hypotheses, and the public domain, in which these professionals present their “visual thinking” to the general public&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;—planning relies more heavily than many other fields on collaboration between the general public and professionals.

Planners use geovisualization as a tool for modeling the environmental interests and policy concerns of the general public. Jiang et al.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt; mention two examples, in which “3D photorealistic representations are used to show urban redevelopment [and] dynamic computer simulations are used to show possible pollution diffusion over the next few years.” The widespread use of the Internet by the general public has implications for these collaborative planning efforts, leading to increased participation by the public while decreasing the amount of time it takes to debate more controversial planning decisions.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4363">'''Global Maritime Situational Awareness''' ('''GMSA''') is defined in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213300/http://www.gmsa.gov/twiki/bin/view/Main/MDAConOps U.S. National Concept of Operations for Maritime Domain Awareness, December 2007], as "the comprehensive fusion of data from every agency and by every nation to improve knowledge of the maritime domain." It is an integral element of [[Maritime Domain Awareness|Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA)]].

Essentially, no one country, department, or agency holds all of the authorities and capabilities to have effective Maritime Domain Awareness on its own. However, by combining separate pieces of information from agencies at the federal, state, local, and tribal level around the world with information from the maritime industry and other non-governmental organizations, it is possible to keep track of the status of every ocean-bound and sea-bound vessel. GMSA results from combining intelligence given by other regions of the world into a complete picture for identifying trends and detecting anomalies.

== Development of GMSA in the U.S. ==
In the United States, the director for GMSA is responsible for managing data critical to building the situational awareness component of global MDA. The director also develops and recommends policy guidance for coordinated collection, fusion, analysis, and dissemination of GMSA information and products, as well as information integration policies, protocols and standards. The director also recommends improvements to situational
awareness-related activities supporting maritime information collection, fusion, analysis and
dissemination. The director co-chairs the U.S. National MDA Stakeholder Board, sits on the MDA Stakeholder Board Executive Steering Committee, and is a member of the U.S. Maritime Security Policy Coordinating Committee (MSPCC).

The GMSA staff consists of and is supported by dedicated subject matter experts from across the federal government as selected by the Director from departmental nominees from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], [[Department Of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy's]] [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].

The GMSA Director and staff form the [[Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness#External links|Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness.]]

==Maritime anomaly detection==
Maritime anomaly detection is an area of scientific study aimed at avoiding maritime collisions. There are a number of aspects to this work, and there have been several conferences and workshops exploring the domain. A google search on "Maritime anomaly detection" returns a large number of hits from a wide range of domains. Some of the related topics are:
*Maritime anomaly detection and situation awareness
*Maritime anomaly detection and [[threat assessment]]
*Visual analytics for maritime anomaly detection 
Some of the significant events exploring the area are:
*The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection - MAD 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://mad.uvt.nl/ The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection] (MAD 2011), Tilburg, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26989">{{distinguish|ICAO airport code|text=|selfref=}}
An '''IATA airport code''', also known as an '''IATA location identifier''', '''IATA station code''' or simply a '''location identifier''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/codes|title=IATA - Codes - Airline and Airport Codes Search|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-letter code designating many [[airport]]s around the world, defined by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on [[bag tag|baggage tags]] attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.

The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by IATA headquarters in [[Montreal]]. The codes are published semiannually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/coding|title=IATA - Airline Coding Directory|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATA also provides codes for [[railway]] stations and for airport handling entities. A [[list of airports]] sorted by IATA code is available. A [[List of IATA-indexed railway stations|list of railway station codes]], shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as [[Amtrak]], [[SNCF|SNCF French Rail]], and [[Deutsche Bahn]], is available. Many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations, such as the [[list of Amtrak station codes]].

==List==

==History and conventions==
Airport codes arose out of the convenience that it brought pilots for location identification in the 1930s. Initially, pilots in the United States used the two-letter code from the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) for identifying cities. This system became unmanageable for cities and towns without an NWS identifier, thus a three-letter system of airport codes was implemented. This system allowed for 17,576 permutations, assuming all letters can be used in conjunction with each other.&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport ABCs: An Explanation of Airport Identifier Codes|year=1994|url=http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.html|work=Air Line Pilot|publisher=Air Line Pilots Association|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, airport codes are named after the first three letters of the city in which it is located—[[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|ATL]] for [[Atlanta]], [[Singapore Changi Airport|SIN]] for [[Singapore]], [[Silvio Pettirossi International Airport|ASU]] for [[Asunción]], [[Benito Juárez International Airport|MEX]] for [[Mexico City]], [[Denver International Airport|DEN]] for [[Denver]]; [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport|IST]] for [[Istanbul]]; or a combination of the letters in its name, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|EWR]] for [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla International Airport|GDL]] for [[Guadalajara]], [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|JNB]] for [[Johannesburg]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|HKG]] for [[Hong Kong]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|SLC]] for [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|WAW]] for [[Warsaw]]. Some airports in the United States retained their NWS codes and simply appended an X at the end, such as [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] for [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland International Airport|PDX]] for [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|PHX]] for [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Sometimes the airport code reflects pronunciation, rather than spelling, such as [[Nadi International Airport|NAN]], which reflects the pronunciation of "Nadi" as {{IPA-fj|ˈnandi|}} in [[Fijian language|Fijian]], where "d" is realized as the [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized stop]] {{IPA|[ⁿd]}}.

For many reasons, some airport codes do not fit the normal scheme described above. Some airports, for example, cross several municipalities or regions, and mix the letters around, giving rise to DFW for [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|'''D'''allas–'''F'''ort '''W'''orth]], DTW for [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|'''D'''e'''t'''roit–'''W'''ayne County]], LBA for [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|'''L'''eeds '''B'''radford ('''A'''irport)]], MSP for [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport|'''M'''inneapolis–'''S'''aint '''P'''aul]], and RDU for [[Raleigh–Durham International Airport|'''R'''aleigh–'''Du'''rham]].

{{citation needed span|text=Canada originally used two letters for identification of a weather reporting station in the 1930s. Additionally, preceding the two-letter code, was placed a Y (meaning "yes") where the reporting station was co-located with an airport, a W (meaning "without") where the reporting station was not co-located with an airport, and a U where the reporting station was co-located with an [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]. An X was used if the last two letters of the code had already been taken by another Canadian ident, and a Z was used if the locator could be confused with a U.S. three letter ident.|date=April 2018}}

===Cities with multiple airports===
In large metropolitan areas, airport codes are often named after the airport itself instead of the city it serves, while another code is reserved which refers to the city itself. For instance:

* [[Berlin]] (BER)&amp;nbsp;– [[Berlin Tegel Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport]] (SXF), and the under construction [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER)
* [[Bucharest]] (BUH)&amp;nbsp;– [[Henri Coandă International Airport|Otopeni]] (OTP) is named after the town of [[Otopeni|'''Ot'''o'''p'''eni]] which the airport is located, while the city also has another airport inside the city limits, [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|Băneasa]] (BBU).
* [[Buenos Aires]] (BUE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (EZE) is named after the suburb in [[Ezeiza Partido]] which the airport is located, while [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] (AEP) is in the city proper.
* [[Chicago]] (CHI)&amp;nbsp;– [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] (ORD), named after '''Or'''chard Fiel'''d''', the airport's former name, and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] (MDW)
* [[Jakarta]] (JKT)&amp;nbsp;– [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport|Soekarno–Hatta]] (CGK) is named after '''C'''en'''gk'''areng, the [[Cengkareng|district in which the airport is located]], while the city also has another airport, [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Perdanakusuma]] (HLP). JKT had referred to the city's former airport, [[Kemayoran Airport]] which is now closed.
* [[London]] (LON)&amp;nbsp;– [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] (LHR), [[Gatwick]] (LGW), [[London City Airport|London City]] (LCY),&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] (STN), [[Luton Airport|Luton]] (LTN) and [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] (SEN)
* [[Milan]] (MIL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Milan–Malpensa Airport|Malpensa]] (MXP), [[Linate Airport|Linate]] (LIN) and [[Orio al Serio Airport|Orio al Serio]] (BGY)
* [[Miami]] (MIA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] (MIA), [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]] (FLL), [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]] (PBI)
* [[Montreal]] (YMQ)&amp;nbsp;– [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Trudeau]] (YUL), [[Montréal-Mirabel International Airport|Mirabel]] (YMX), and [[Montréal/Saint-Hubert Airport|Saint-Hubert]] (YHU)

* [[New York City]] (NYC)&amp;nbsp;– [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy]] (JFK, formerly Idlewild (IDL)), [[La Guardia Airport|La Guardia]] (LGA), and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Liberty]] (EWR)
* [[Osaka]] (OSA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kansai International Airport|Kansai]] (KIX) and [[Osaka International Airport|Itami]] (ITM, formerly OSA)
* [[Paris]] (PAR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Orly Airport|Orly]] (ORY), [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] (CDG), [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]] (LBG) and [[Beauvais–Tillé Airport]] (BVA)
* [[Rio de Janeiro]] (RIO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Galeão Airport|Galeão]] (GIG) and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (SDU)
* [[Rome]] (ROM)&amp;nbsp;– [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Fiumicino]] (FCO) and [[Ciampino Airport|Ciampino]] (CIA)
* [[São Paulo]] (SAO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]] (CGH), [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|Guarulhos]] (GRU) and [[Viracopos International Airport|Campinas]] (VCP)
* [[Sapporo]] (SPK)&amp;nbsp;– [[New Chitose Airport|Chitose]] (CTS) and [[Okadama Airport|Okadama]] (OKD)
* [[Seoul]] (SEL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Incheon Airport|Incheon]] (ICN) and [[Gimpo Airport|Gimpo]] (GMP, formerly SEL)
* [[Stockholm]] (STO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Stockholm–Arlanda Airport|Arlanda]] (ARN), [[Stockholm–Bromma Airport|Bromma]] (BMA), [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Nyköping–Skavsta]] (NYO) and [[Stockholm Västerås Airport|Västerås]] (VST)
* [[Tokyo]] (TYO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Haneda Airport|Haneda]] (HND) and [[Narita Airport|Narita]] (NRT)
* [[Toronto]] (YTO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson]] (YYZ), [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|Bishop]] (YTZ), [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport|Hamilton]] (YHM), and [[Region of Waterloo International Airport|Waterloo]] (YKF)
* [[Washington, D.C.]] (WAS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles]] (IAD), [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan]] (DCA), and [[Baltimore–Washington International Airport|Baltimore–Washington]] (BWI)

Or using a code for the city in one of the major airport and then assign another code to another airport:
* [[Bangkok]] (BKK)&amp;nbsp;– [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Suvarnabhumi]] (BKK) and [[Don Mueang International Airport|Don Mueang]] (DMK)
* [[Beijing]] (BJS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Capital]] (PEK) and [[Nanyuan Airport|Nanyuan]] (NAY)
* [[Dallas]] (DFW)&amp;nbsp;- [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW) and [[Dallas Love Field]] (DAL)
* [[Dubai]] (DXB)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dubai International Airport|International]] (DXB) and [[Al Maktoum International Airport|Al Maktoum]] (DWC)
* [[Houston]] (HOU)&amp;nbsp;- [[William P. Hobby Airport]] (HOU) and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH)
* [[Johannesburg]] (JNB)&amp;nbsp;– [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|O. R. Tambo (formerly Jan Smuts)]] (JNB) and [[Lanseria International Airport|Lanseria]] (HLA)
* [[Kiev]] (IEV)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)]] (IEV) and [[Boryspil International Airport]] (KBP)
* [[Kuala Lumpur]] (KUL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Sepang]] (KUL) and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang]] (SZB)
* [[Medellín]] (MDE)&amp;nbsp;– [[José María Córdova International Airport|José María Córdova]] (MDE) and [[Olaya Herrera Airport|Olaya Herrera]] (EOH)
* [[Nagoya]] (NGO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Chubu Centrair International Airport|Centrair]] (NGO) and [[Nagoya Airfield|Komaki]] (NKM)
* [[Shanghai]] (SHA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Pudong]] (PVG) and [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Hongqiao]] (SHA)
* [[Taipei]] (TPE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taoyuan]] (TPE) and [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Songshan]] (TSA)
* [[Tehran]] (THR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport|Imam Khomeini]] (IKA) and [[Mehrabad International Airport|Mehrabad]] (THR)

When different cities with the same name each have an airport, the airports need to be assigned different codes. For example,
* [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM) is in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], United States and [[Birmingham Airport]] (BHX) is in [[Birmingham]], England, United Kingdom.
* [[Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport]] (SJC) is in [[San Jose, California]], United States and [[Juan Santamaría International Airport]] (SJO) is in San José, Costa Rica.
* [[Portland International Jetport]] (PWM) is in [[Portland, Maine]], while [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX) is in [[Portland, Oregon]].

Sometimes, a new airport is built, replacing the old one, leaving the city's new "major" airport code to no longer correspond with the city's name. The original airport in Nashville, Tennessee was built in 1936 as part of the Works Progress Administration and called Berry Field with the designation, BNA. A new facility known as Nashville International Airport was built in 1987 but still uses BNA. This is in conjunction to rules aimed to avoid confusion that seem to apply in the United States, which state that "the first and second letters or second and third letters of an identifier may not be duplicated with less than 200 [[nautical mile]]s separation."&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Thus, Washington D.C. area's three airports all have radically different codes: IAD for [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington–Dulles]], DCA for [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington–Reagan]] (District of Columbia Airport), and BWI for [[Baltimore Airport|Baltimore]] (Baltimore–Washington International, formerly BAL).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Since HOU is used for [[William P. Hobby Airport]], the new [[Houston–Intercontinental]] became IAH.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; The code BKK was originally assigned to [[Don Mueang International Airport|Bangkok–Don Mueang]] and was later transferred to [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]], while the former adopted DMK. [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Shanghai–Hongqiao]] retained the code SHA, while the newer [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai–Pudong]] adopted PVG. The opposite is true for [[Berlin]], the airport [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin–Tegel]] uses the code TXL, while its smaller counterpart [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|Berlin–Schönefeld]] uses SXF; the new [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is going to have the code BER. Hamburg (HAM) and Hannover (HAJ) are less than 100 NM apart and still use the same first and middle letter, indicating that this rule might be followed only locally.

===Cities or airports changing names===
Many cities retain historical names in their airport codes, despite the fact that their official name or its official spelling or transliteration is now different:
* in [[Armenia]]: [[Shirak Airport|LWN]] for [[Gyumri]] (formerly Leninakan)
* in [[Bangladesh]]: [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport|DAC]] for [[Dhaka]] (formerly [[Dacca]])
* in [[Canada]]: [[Iqaluit Airport|YFB]] for [[Iqaluit]] (formerly Frobisher Bay)
* in [[China]]: [[Beijing Capital International Airport|PEK]] for Beijing (formerly Peking), [[Tianjin Binhai International Airport|TSN]] for [[Tianjin]] (formerly Tientsin), [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport|CKG]] for [[Chongqing]] (formerly Chungking), [[Qingdao Airport|TAO]] for [[Qingdao]] (formerly Tsingtao), and [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport|CAN]] for [[Guangzhou]] (formerly Canton). The older IATA codes follow [[Chinese postal romanization]], introduced in 1906, officially abolished in 1964 and in use well into the 1980s, while gradually superseded by [[Pinyin]]
* in [[Greenland]]:  most airports, including [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|SFJ]] for [[Kangerlussuaq]] (formerly Søndre Strømfjord) and [[Nuuk Airport|GOH]] for [[Nuuk]] (formerly Godthåb)
* in [[India]]: BLR for Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|BOM]] for [[Mumbai]] (formerly [[Bombay]]), [[Kolkata Airport|CCU]] for [[Kolkata]] (formerly [[Calcutta]]), and [[Chennai International Airport|MAA]] for [[Chennai]] (formerly [[Madras]])
* in [[Indonesia]]: [[Radin Inten II Airport|TKG]] for [[Bandar Lampung]] (formerly Tanjung Karang), [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|UPG]] for [[Makassar]] (formerly Ujung Pandang). In addition, when the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System]] was introduced in 1972, a few older IATA codes retained the previous spelling: [[Sultan Iskandar Muda International Airport|BTJ]] for [[Banda Aceh]] (formerly Banda Atjeh), [[Sentani International Airport|DJJ]] for [[Jayapura]] (formerly Djajapura), [[Adisutjipto International Airport|JOG]] for [[Yogyakarta]] (formerly Jogjakarta)
* in [[Kazakhstan]]: [[Astana International Airport|TSE]] for [[Astana]] (formerly Tselinograd), [[Aktau Airport|SCO]] for [[Aktau]] (formerly Shevchenko), [[Atyrau Airport|GUW]] for [[Atyrau]] (formerly Guryev), [[Taraz Airport|DMB]] for [[Taraz]] (formerly Dzhambyl), [[Semey Airport|PLX]] for [[Semey]] (formerly Semipalatinsk)
* in [[Kyrgyzstan]]: [[Manas International Airport|FRU]] for [[Bishkek]] (formerly Frunze)
* in [[Moldova]]: [[Chișinău International Airport|KIV]] for [[Chișinău]] (formerly Kishinev)
* in [[Montenegro]]: [[Podgorica Airport|TGD]] for [[Podgorica]] (formerly Titograd)
* in [[Myanmar]]: [[Yangon International Airport|RGN]] for [[Yangon]] (formerly Rangoon)
* in [[Russia]]: [[Pulkovo Airport|LED]] for [[St. Petersburg]] (formerly Leningrad), [[Strigino International Airport|GOJ]] for [[Nizhny Novgorod]] (formerly Gorky), [[Koltsovo Airport|SVX]] for [[Yekaterinburg]] (formerly Sverdlovsk), [[Kurumoch International Airport|KUF]] for [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] (formerly Kuybyshev), [[Beslan Airport|OGZ]] for [[Vladikavkaz]] (formerly Ordzhonikidze) and others
* in [[Tajikistan]]: [[Khujand Airport|LBD]] for [[Khujand]] (formerly Leninabad)
* in [[Turkmenistan]]: [[Turkmenbashi International Airport|KRW]] for [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]] (formerly Krasnovodsk); [[Turkmenabat Airport|CRZ]] for [[Türkmenabat]] (formerly Chardzhev)
* in [[Ukraine]]: [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)|IEV]] for [[Kiev]]; [[Luhansk International Airport|VSG]] for [[Luhansk]] (formerly Voroshilovgrad); [[Kropyvnytskyi Airport|KGO]] for [[Kropyvnytskyi]] (formerly Kirovograd); [[Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport|LWO]] for [[Lviv, Ukraine|Lviv]] (formerly Lwów while part of Poland until 1939, and still called Lvov in Russian); [[Ivano-Frankivsk International Airport|IFO]] for [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] (in Soviet times spelt in Russian as Ivano-Frankovsk);
* in [[Vietnam]]: [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|SGN]] for [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (formerly Saigon)

Some airport codes are based on previous names associated with a present airport, often with military heritage.  These include as Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], which is assigned ORD, based on its old name of Orchard Field, before it was expanded and renamed O'Hare in the mid-1950s. Similarly, [[Orlando International Airport]] uses MCO, based on the old McCoy Air Force Base, which was converted to joint civilian/military use and renamed Orlando Jetport at McCoy in the early 1960s and finally Orlando International in the early 1980s. Other airport codes are similarly not immediately obvious in origin, and each have their own peculiarities. Nashville uses [[Nashville Airport|BNA]] (Berry Field, henceforth ''B''erry ''N''ashville ''A''irport), [[Knoxville]] uses [[McGhee Tyson Airport|TYS]], for [[Charles McGhee Tyson]], whose family donated the land for the first airport in Knoxville, and [[Kahului]] (the main gateway into [[Maui]]) uses [[Kahului Airport|OGG]], while [[Spokane International Airport]] goes by GEG. Most of these are named after individuals.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; In Asia, codes that do not correspond with their city's names include [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]]'s [[Niigata Airport|KIJ]], [[Nanchang]]'s [[Nanchang Airport|KHN]], [[Pyongyang]]'s [[Pyongyang International Airport|FNJ]], and [[Kobe]]'s [[Kobe Airport|UKB]].

Some airports are identified even in colloquial speech by their airport code. The most notable examples are LAX and JFK.

===National policies===
Since the [[U.S. Navy]] reserved "N" codes and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has [[Call signs in North America|reserved rights for "W" and "K"]], certain U.S. cities which begin with these letters had to adopt "irregular" airport codes: EWR for Newark, [[Norfolk International Airport|ORF]] for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], EYW for [[Key West, Florida]], and [[Napa County Airport|APC]] for [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; This "rule" does not apply outside the United States: [[Karachi]] is KHI, [[Warsaw]] is WAW, [[Nagoya]] is NGO. In addition, since "Q" was used for international communications, cities with "Q" beginning their name also had to find alternate codes, as in the case of [[Qiqihar]] (NDG), [[Quetta]] (UET) and [[Quito]] (UIO).

IATA codes should not be confused with the [[Location identifier#FAA identifier|FAA identifiers]] of US airports. Most FAA identifiers agree with the corresponding IATA codes, but some do not, such as [[Saipan International Airport|Saipan]] whose FAA identifier is GSN and its IATA code is SPN, and some coincide with IATA codes of non-US airports.

Most large airports in Canada have codes that begin with the letter "Y", although not all "Y" codes are Canadian (for example, YUM for Yuma, Arizona) and not all Canadian airports start with the letter "Y" (for example ZBF for Bathurst, New Brunswick). Many Canadian airports have a code that starts with W, X or Z, but none of these are major airports. When the Canadian transcontinental railways were built, each station was assigned its own two letter Morse code. VR was Vancouver, TZ Toronto, QB Quebec, WG Winnipeg, SJ St. Johns, YC Calgary, OW Ottawa, EG Edmonton, etc. When the Canadian government established airports, it used the existing railway codes for them as well. If the airport had a weather station, authorities added a "Y" to the front of the code, meaning "Yes" to indicate it had a weather station, or some other letter to indicate it did not. When international codes were created in cooperation with the United States, because "Y" was seldom used in the US, Canada simply used the weather station codes for its airports, changing the "Y" to a "Z" if it conflicted with an airport code already in use. The result is that most major Canadian airport codes start with "Y" followed by two letters in the city's name: [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|YOW]] for [[Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|YWG]] for [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary International Airport|YYC]] for [[Calgary]], and [[Vancouver International Airport|YVR]] for [[Vancouver]], whereas other Canadian airports append the two letter code of the radio beacons that were the closest to the actual airport, such as [[Gander International Airport|YQX]] in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Prince George Airport|YXS]] in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].

Four of the ten provincial capital airports in Canada have ended up with codes beginning with YY, including YYZ for Toronto, Ontario, YYJ for Victoria, British Columbia, YYT for St. John's, Newfoundland, and YYG for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Canada's largest airport is YYZ for [[Toronto–Pearson International Airport|Toronto–Pearson]] (YTZ was used for Toronto City Airport, so YYZ is the station code for a village called Malton, which is where Toronto Pearson International Airport is actually located). YUL is used for [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montréal–Trudeau]] (UL was the ID code for beacon in the city of Kirkland, now the location of Montréal–Trudeau). While these codes make it difficult for the public to associate them with a particular Canadian city, some codes have become popular in usage despite their cryptic nature, particularly at the largest airports. Toronto's YYZ code has entered pop culture in the form of [[YYZ_(instrumental)|a popular rock song]] utilizing the "YYZ" Morse code signal. Some airports have started using their IATA codes as marketing brands. [[Calgary International Airport]] has begun using its airport code YYC as a marketing brand and name for the airport authority web site (yyc.com),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YYC: Calgary Airport Authority |url=http://www.yyc.com/|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vancouver International Airport]] advertises as YVR (yvr.com).

Numerous New Zealand airports use codes which contain a letter Z, to distinguish them from similar airport names in other countries. Examples include [[Hamilton Airport (New Zealand)|HLZ]] for [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Queenstown Airport|ZQN]] for [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], and [[Westport Airport (New Zealand)|WSZ]] for [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]].

===Lack of codes===
It is also noteworthy that there are several airports with scheduled service that have not been assigned ICAO codes that do have IATA codes. For example, several airports in Alaska that have scheduled commercial service, such as [[Stebbins Airport]] or [[Nanwalek Airport]], using [[Location identifier|FAA codes instead]]. There are also airports with scheduled service for which there are ICAO codes but not IATA codes, such as [[Nkhotakota Airport]]/[[Tangole Airport]] in [[List of airports in Malawi|Malawi]] or [[Chōfu Airport]] in Tokyo, Japan. Also several minor airports in [[Russia]] (e.g. [[Omsukchan Airport]]) which instead use [[Location identifier|internal Russian codes]] for booking. Flights to these airports can't be booked through the international air booking systems (or have luggage transferred all the way), instead booked through the airline or a domestic booking system. Thus, neither system completely includes all airports with scheduled service.

The '''iGO''' Navigation Engine, developed by [[Hungary]]-based [[NNG (company)|NNG]] LLC (formerly Nav N Go) is a [[GPS navigation software]] package. NNG sells some versions of the software directly to users, as well as to device manufacturers, auto makers, network operators and professional transport specialists. Products based on iGO are available in brands including [[Harman Kardon|Becker]], [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Samsung]] and [[Vodafone]].&lt;ref name="references"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/references |title=References |publisher=Nng.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214172957/http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/references |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product history ==
iGO My way 2006 was the first GPS navigation software package by Nav N Go (now NNG) for [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]/[[personal navigation assistant|PNA]] devices, introduced in 2005 at [[CeBIT]], Hannover.&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/company-overview |title=The NNG Story |publisher=Nng.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214174358/http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/company-overview |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the new map compression technology, the product fits on a 1GB [[SD card]]. An improved version was iGO My way 2006 Plus, announced in 2006.

NNG's iGO 8 (for PDA/PNA devices) was released in April 2008. It offered high-definition 3D navigation maps of terrain, road elevation, landmarks and 3D buildings.&lt;ref name="iGO 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Nav-N-Go-iGO-8-available-for-Windows-smartphones-in-Europe_a852.html |title=Nav N Go iGO 8 available for Windows smartphones in Europe |publisher=Gpsbusinessnews.com |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps and updates are available for over 90 countries and regions, including countries from Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. In 2013, the portal supports 5.200 devices and counts close to 1.8 million registered users globally.&lt;ref name="naviextras"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naviextras.com/ |title=naviextras.com |publisher=naviextras.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As NNG is an independent map provider, it works with several map suppliers in different geographical regions. There are different versions of maps running on the iGO Navigation software for the same country or region made by different map suppliers, including [[TomTom]], [[Here (company)|HERE]], Sensis  and regional providers.

'''Long Range Kinematic (LRK)''' technology is a sophisticated kinematic method developed by Magellan (formerly Thales) Navigation that optimises the advantages of dual-frequency [[GPS]] operation. Other conventional methods use the dual-frequency only during initialisation. LRK makes solving ambiguities during initialisation easy and continuous dual-frequency kinematic operation possible at distances up to 40 kilometres.

Conventional dual-frequency kinematic operation is limited to about 10 kilometres, using a combined observation on GPS L1 and L2 frequencies to produce an initial wide lane solution, ambiguous to around 86 centimetres. During a second phase, the conventional kinematic method uses measurements from the L1 frequency only. This method only allows for kinematic operation as long as the de-correlation of atmospheric errors is compatible with a pure phase single-frequency solution.

Similar to the [[Kinematic Applications in Real Time|KART]] process, LRK is a simple and reliable method that allows any initialisation mode, from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.

{{main|UN-OHRLLS}}

The [[United Nations]] has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate{{clarify|date=March 2017}} themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries.&lt;ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/&gt; One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in [[Mombasa]], furthering delivery contract delays.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

==Dependency problems==
Although [[Adam Smith]] and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, [[Rwanda]] and then finally [[Burundi]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"/&gt; Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three [[BRIC]] nations (China, [[Russia]] and [[India]]) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
[[File:Map displaying landlocked Burundi's strife with finding a suitable export route.png|thumb|400px| Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were:

* dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or

&lt;br&gt;* dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or 
* dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red).
When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown).]]
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of [[Tanzania]] is poorly connected to the port of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt; Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through [[Mozambique]] around the same time due to violent civil conflict.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"/&gt; Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500&amp;nbsp;km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Other African countries===

* [[Mali]] had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours ([[Algeria]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]) were engaged in civil war around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The exception being Ghana which was under a military rule but did not have an active civil war
* The [[Central African Republic]]'s export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s [[Oubangui River]] water levels are too low for river travel.&lt;ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/&gt;

===Central Asia===

The mineral resource-rich countries of [[Central Asia]] and [[Mongolia]] offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: [[Kazakhstan]]’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/&gt; Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"&gt;Fara. 2012, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;Paudel. 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Railways]] now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.&lt;ref&gt;Bulag. 2009, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the [[Soviet Union]]'s social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity.&lt;ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/&gt; Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], resulting in revenue generation through the port of [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"/&gt;

===Nepal===
[[Nepal]] is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources.&lt;ref name="Shrestha 1976"/&gt; It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt; treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almaty Ministerial Conference==
In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general.&lt;ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/&gt; The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows:
*Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays
*Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia
*Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market
*To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvements&lt;ref&gt;UN-OHRLLS. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
[[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. and B.T. Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2):87–96; Wiens, J.A.: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds) 1999: Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology.

In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===

[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|220px|left|thumb|[[Medieval]] Ridge and Furrow above [[Wood Stanway]], [[Gloucestershire]], England.]]
Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

{{See also|Landscaping|Landscape design|Landscape architecture|Garden|Park}}
The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

(1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A.

Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source =from ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805), Book 13, lines 41-51.&lt;br&gt;by [[William Wordsworth]]
}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

====Landscape photography====

Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">'''Light dues''' are the charges levied on ships for the maintenance of [[lighthouse]]s and other [[navigation aid|aids to navigation]].

==British Isles==
Light dues are levied on commercial vessels and larger pleasure boats calling at ports in the [[British Isles]] and paid into the '''General Lighthouse Fund''' (GLF), which is under the stewardship of the UK's [[Department for Transport]] and is used to finance the lighthouse services provided by the three [[General Lighthouse Authority|General Lighthouse Authorities]] that cover all of the British Isles:
* [[Trinity House]] for England, Wales, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands
* [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] for Scotland and the Isle of Man
* [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]] for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland

The main principles of the light dues system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/th/about/funding.html |title=Funding |publisher=Trinity House |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The UK [[Department for Transport]] sets the level of light dues in the UK, which is reviewed annually, taking advice from the General Lighthouse Authorities and representatives of the shipping industry. The Irish [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport]] sets the level of light dues in the Republic of Ireland.
* In most cases, the rate charged is based on the net registered tonnage of the vessel. The current UK rate (from 1 May 2017) is 37.5 pence per net registered ton, with a maximum charge of £15,000 per voyage (equivalent to 40,000 tons); in Ireland it is 60 cent, with a maximum charge of 24,000Euro.
* A vessel pays light dues when it first calls at a port in the UK or Ireland; thereafter it is exempt from further payments for one month. Each vessel is charged for a maximum of nine voyages per annum.
* Vessels calling in the UK and Republic of Ireland are required to pay the rate applicable at the port where they are first liable to pay light dues. The nine voyage cap applies regardless of whether the port calls are in the UK or Ireland.
* Tugs and fishing vessels (of 10metres in length or more) make an annual payment based on the registered length of the vessel. Pleasure boats (of 20tons or more) make a monthly payment up to an annual maximum.

Increasing automation of aids to navigation in the British Isles has seen the rate of Light Dues fall in real terms over recent years. The first increase in the Light Dues rate for twenty years occurred in 2009. In 2010, with the rate at 41p, the UK Government announced that there would be no further increases for at least the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101208 |title=Government support for the maritime industry and light dues update |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate was then cut by one penny in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016, with a further half penny in 2017 to reach its current level of 37.5p.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/light-dues-2017-to-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the UK Government announced it had reached agreement with the Irish Government that aids to navigation off the coast of the Republic of Ireland would be wholly funded from domestic sources there by 2015-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110118 |title=UK and Irish Ministers agree reform for funding of Irish Lights |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the way light dues payments are enforced in the UK and Ireland were implemented from 1 April 2015 to give effect to this agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/commissioners-of-irish-lights |title=Commissioners of Irish Lights |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2014-10-16 |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">This is a '''list of geocoding systems''', in the sense of schemes that assign systematic labels to geographic entities.

This is ''not'' a list of software systems that can perform [[geocoding]] in the sense of turning a geographic name into a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].

Some of these code systems are free for use, others have different [[licence]]s.

==Administrative==
Codes with only partial coverture of the globe, mainlly for "administrative regions", like countries or biomes.
 
'''General''' use:
*[[ISO 3166-1]] and [[ISO 3166-2]]: country codes and codes of its subdivisions
*[[Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes|HASC]] (Hierarchical Administrative Subdivision Codes)
*[[ONS coding system|ONS]] code, [[United Kingdom|UK]] only, administrative
*[[MARC country code]]s
*[[Standard Geographical Classification code (Canada)|SGC codes]], [[Canada]] only, statistical
*[[UN M.49]] region codes, area code, continents, countries (like [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]])

'''Airport''' codes:

*[[IATA airport code]]s, area /point codes, airports and 3-letter city codes 
*[[ICAO airport code]]s, area /point codes, airports

'''Internet''' codes: [[IANA country code]]s similar to [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]

'''Sport''' codes: [[IOC country code]]s, area, worldwide

'''Environment''' codes: [[Longhurst code]], a set of four-letter codes used in ecological geography

=== National standards ===
*  [[United States|U.S.]], '''FIPS''' codes:
**[[FIPS country code]]s (FIPS 10-4), area code, administrative, free
**[[FIPS place code]]s (FIPS 55) [[United States|U.S.]] only, free
**[[FIPS county code]]s (FIPS 6-4) US only, free
**[[FIPS state code]]s (FIPS 5-2) US only

==Geodesy==
:Summarized from [[Discrete_Global_Grid#Geocoding_variants|Discrete Global Grid]]

Popular or in "official use":

*S2, a geocoding scheme using [[spherical geometry]] and the space-filling [[Hilbert curve]], developed at [[Google]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s2geometry.io/about/overview|title=Overview|website=s2geometry.io|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/s2-cells-and-space-filling-curves-keys-to-building-better-digital-map-tools-for-cities-a312aa5e2f59|title=S2 cells and space-filling curves: Keys to building better digital map tools for cities|last=Kreiss|first=Sven|date=2016-07-27|website=Medium|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[World Meteorological Organization squares|WMO squares]]

*{{anchor|GEOID}}GEOID, the name of [[United States Census Bureau]] geographic identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/geoidentifiers.html | title = Understanding Geographic Identifiers (GEOIDs) | website = [[United States Census Bureau]] | accessdate = March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Munich Orientation Convention]]

==Mapping not geodesy==
*[[WOEID]]

==[[Border|Boundaries]]==
Below are separate lists of [[countries]] and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] with their land boundaries, and lists of which countries and dependencies border [[oceans]] and major [[sea]]s.  The first short section describes the borders or edges of [[continents]] and oceans/major seas.  Disputed areas are not considered.

===[[Continent]]s===
''(Notes: Dependencies and islands remote from continental land masses{{vague|date=October 2018}} are not considered and are '''excluded''' from this list section; thus only continental land borders are considered.   The only countries listed either straddle continents or are on a continent border.)''

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instarea defines location intelligence as "Using [[machine learning]] algorithms to uncover trends that would be otherwise unknown using human based rules in a large location data set."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==

Location intelligence is used by a broad range of industries to improve overall business results. Applications include:
* [[Communications]] and [[telecommunications]]: [[Network planning and design]], boundary identification, identifying new customer markets.
* [[Financial services]]: Optimize branch locations, market analysis, [[Share of Wallet|share of wallet]] and [[cross-sell]] activities, [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]], industry sector analysis, risk management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">An alluvial '''[http://www.megafans.in/ megafan]''' is a large cone or fan-shaped deposit built up by complex deposition patterns of stream flows originating from a single source point known as an apex. Megafans differ from [[Alluvial fan]]s in their sheer size. Due to their larger size, they may be formed by different geomorphic processes. The criterion of what differentiates megafans from typical alluvial fans is an artificial one of scale. The scale divide varies in the literature, with the most common being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values as little of 30-km apex-to-toe length have been proposed, as well as alternative metrics like coverage areas of greater than 10,000 square-km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

==Formation==
The flow source from the apex occupies a portion of the fans apron, building up that portion with depositions. Through complex processes like avulsion, the stream changes course over time occupying different areas of the fan. Over long periods of time, sediment builds up creating a fan formation. Generally the three-dimensional architecture of megafan deposits consists of multi-storied sandsheets, gravel in upper reaches, interbedded with overbank muddy layers, thickness and facies distribution vary from upstream to downstream reaches &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

Rivers forming large fans happen in various settings around the world most notably, in foreland settings (e.g. Kosi, Gandak, Pastaza), intracratonic basins (e.g. Pantanal, Taquari, Cuiaba), and in complex settings like in the case of Pilcomayo. Although the distribution of megafans occur throughout many environments, the Tropics are home of the largest megafans of the world in the Chaco Plain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

[[File:WikiMunzee.png|thumb|Illustration of a Munzee, which players create and hide for other players to find]]

'''Munzee''' is a [[freemium]] [[scavenger hunt]] game where places have to be found in the real world. The game is similar to [[geocaching]] but uses [[QR code]] technology, in addition to device [[GPS]] location, to prove the find instead of a logbook. Launched in [[Texas]] in 2011, the game caught on first in [[Germany]], along with [[California]] and [[Michigan]]. It is now played in more than 188 countries around the world, and there is at least one physical Munzee deployed on every continent, including [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name = "Spencer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorsey|first=Erika|title=Member Spotlight|journal=Heartland Highlights|date=2012|url=https://heartlandowners.org/rally/2013/LTA_munzee_hand-out.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The places are marked by other players using QR codes, which are hidden and often printed on weatherproof stickers. The places can also be marked by a [[Near field communication|NFC]] tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Mike|title=Munzee adds NFC to geolocation game|url=http://www.nfcworld.com/2012/09/05/317625/munzee-adds-nfc-to-geolocation-game/|publisher=NFC World|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stickers are called Munzees. Both the finding and the hiding players receive points for deploying and finding Munzees. The QR codes on the Munzees are read by means of a [[smartphone]] app for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or Windows.
&lt;ref name = "Spencer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Susan|url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121110/NEWS/111109916/1246|title=New game in town|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Telegram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of the Munzees as well as the data of the players are managed via the central web platform.

Virtual Munzees are also available for purchase. These also appear in app lists and on maps, and they are "captured" by locating the app device within 300 feet of the designated location. The device must also be within 300 feet of a QR code Munzee to verify "capture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speurvuur.nl/site/wat-is-munzee?lang=en |title=About Munzee |publisher=speurvuur.nl |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A common misconception is that the idea for Munzee was inspired by [[geocaching]], a game in which participants search for a hidden cache using GPS technology. However, Munzee co-founder Aaron Benzick (having never been a geocacher) came up with the idea of using QR codes for a game in 2008, but smartphone technology and capability were not available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scntx.com/articles/2011/07/03/plano_star-courier/news/8970.txt|title='M' marks the spot: Locally based Munzee takes hi-tech scavenger hunts global|last=Rush|first=Jessica|date=July 3, 2011 |work=Plano Courier Star|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzick, and co-founders, Scott Foster, Chris Pick, and Josh Terkelsen launched the game on July 1, 2011. The term Munzee was derived from the German word for coin, Münze. Since the domain name munze.com was no longer available, an e was added, which also resulted in what the company felt was a catchy name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://munzee.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211253046 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was to use poker chips or rounded coins with QR codes.

[[File:Munzee.jpg|thumb|Munzee on the back of a traffic sign]]

Munzees can consist of any material; they must have at minimum a QR-code and physically meet the conditions of the location (waterproof, weatherproof, etc.). Munzees either can be self-generated and printed or be purchased via the web store or through authorised distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinkman|first=Lillie-Beth|title=Get App-y's odds and ends — Munzee, Pictorama, Flock|url=http://newsok.com/get-app-ys-odds-and-ends-munzee-pictorama-flock/article/3710556?custom_click=rss|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=NewsOK|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFC Munzees and Virtual Munzees can be purchased from the web store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.munzee.com/Game-Pieces/ |title=Munzee store |publisher=munzee.com |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To generate or to order Munzees one has to be logged in on the central platform with a unique username. When generating a Munzee, the platform creates a web link, over which the generated Munzee can be managed. This web link is represented as a QR code on the Munzee. A descriptive name and an arbitrarily long comment can be assigned to the Munzee as properties. Both are stored on the central platform (not in the QR code) and can be changed later.

After a Munzee is physically created, it can be assigned coordinates anywhere outdoors or indoor and then deployed via the app. Business Munzees are also available which are deployed inside a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munzee.com/business |title=Business munzees |publisher=munzee.com |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Munzee has been deployed it goes live on the map and is ready to be found or "captured" by other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first=Adrian|title=Munzee – A scavenger hunt for your smartphone|url=http://gpstracklog.com/2012/08/munzee-a-scavenger-hunt-for-your-smartphone.html|publisher=GPS Tracklog|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a Munzee is damaged or taken down, players can report the malfunction and after two reports the Munzee is taken off the map.

The coordinates of all globally mounted Munzees are managed on the game platform at munzee.com.

When they find a Munzee, they capture it by either scanning the QR code or being within a certain radius of the published coordinates. The smartphone app sends the data scanned along with current coordinates to the central system which records the capture. The finder and the player that deployed the Munzee each earn points. The points award to the person who deploys the munzee and who captures the munzee vary depending on the playing piece deployed.

== Dissemination ==
As of January 2018, there are more than 7 million munzees worldwide in 235 countries, and more than 189 million Munzee captures had been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://statzee.munzee.com/|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Olfactory]] navigation''' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of [[pigeons]], in particular the [[homing pigeon]].

There are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.

==Background==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar.  There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a [[compass]] sense (a sense of direction) and a [[map]] sense (a sense of location).  It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information.  It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. [[Homing (biology)#Magnetic orientation|Magnetic orientation]] as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences de St. Pétersbourg |series=Series VI |volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier |first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal=Rev. phil. France Etranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=W.|author2=Wiltschko, R.|year=1996|title=Magnetic orientation in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=29–38 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/1/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = G | year = 1959 | title = Recent experiments on bird orientation | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02396.x | journal = Ibis | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 399–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that [[anosmic]] pigeons (''Columbia livia'') were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;  On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.

==Olfactory map==
Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F.|year=1990|title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=26|pages=301–305|doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallraff’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans G. Wallraff|title=Das Navigationssystem der Vögel: ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7w1AAAAMAAJ|date=January 1974|publisher=R. Oldenbourg |location=München, Wien|isbn=978-3-486-39631-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘gradient’ model.  Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental [[odours]], within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.&lt;ref name=good01&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=J.|year=2001|title=Perspectives on Animal Behaviour|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site.  An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities.  It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights.  This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours.  Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues,&lt;ref name=hudson03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=M.|year=2003|title=What evidence is there to support pigeons (''Columbia livia'') use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home?|publisher=Sussex University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Papi (1990),&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.

Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means.  It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients.  The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity.  Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft.  This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration.  However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.  Meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;Becker &amp; van Raden (1986). cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R | year = 1996 | title = The Function of Olfactory Input in Pigeon Orientation: Does it Provide Navigational Information or Play Another Role? | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 113–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.

==Empirical evidence==
The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the [[Dovecote|home loft]] with the directions from which they are carried by winds.  Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants.  The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.

Such an experiment was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;Papi F, Ioalé P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187–193&lt;/ref&gt; where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical [[Aviary|aviaries]] composed of bamboo.  Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine.  This was reversed for group two.  The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil.  Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south.  Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.

However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures.&lt;ref name=able96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Able|first=K.P.|year=1996|title=The debate over olfactory navigation by homing pigeons |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, further experiments&lt;ref&gt;Baldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages. In: Schmidt-Koenig K, [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton WT]] (eds) Animal migration, navigation, and homing. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York, pp 78–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer|first1=J. |year=1978 |title=Pigeon homing: A repetition of the deflector loft experiment |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=393–395 |doi=10.1007/BF00303201 |jstor=4599182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"&gt;Waldvogel JA, Benvenuti S, Keeton WT, Papi F (1978) Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft. J Comp Physiol 128:297–301&lt;/ref&gt; applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°.  Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours.  Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’.  The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.

In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced,&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=J.|year=1979 |title=Pigeon homing: deprivation of olfactory information does not affect the deflector effect |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–22 |doi=10.1007/BF00293240}}&lt;/ref&gt; though when [[anosmic]] pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed.  Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect.  Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Researchers support these suggestions&lt;ref&gt;Bang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational&lt;/ref&gt; by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons.  It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.

Conflicting evidence, however, was produced&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of [[benzaldehyde]].  When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented.  Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.

A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected.&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.

==Other sensory cues==
The Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface&lt;ref name=walcott96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walcott|first=C.|year=1996|title=Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton]] (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W. T. | year = 1971 | title = Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 102–106 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | pmid=5276278 | pmc=391171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ioalé (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalé |first=P. |year=1984 |title=Magnets and pigeon orientation |journal=Monitore Zoologico Italiano |volume=18 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.1080/00269786.1984.10736466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt; did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast.  This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = R. P. | year = 1974 | title = Orientation of homing pigeons altered by a change in the direction of the applied magnetic field | url = | journal = Science | volume = 184 | issue = | pages = 180–182 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4133.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Visalberghi | first1 = E. | last2 = Alleva | first2 = E. | year = 1979 | title = Magnetic influences on pigeon homing | url = | journal = Biologica Bulletino | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 246–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated [[magnetic coil|coils]].  Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current.  Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  In [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.&lt;ref name=walcott96/&gt;

The predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass.  This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock.&lt;ref name=hudson03/&gt;  Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory [[European Starling|European starling]], indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt-Koenig |first=K. |year=1958 |title=Experimentelle Einflußnahme auf die 24-Stunden-Periodik bei Brieftauben und deren Auswirkung unterbesonderer Berücksichtigung des Heimfindevermögens |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=15 |pages=301–331 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1958.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive evidence==
The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’  Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons |year=2006 |first1=A. |last1=Gagliardo |first2=P. |last2=Ioale |first3=M.

'''Political geography''' is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of [[politics|political]] processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of [[State (polity)|the state]] at the centre, the study of [[international relations]] (or [[geopolitics]]) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.

== History ==

The British geographer [[Halford Mackinder]] was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history'  or the [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland Theory]] (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world.  This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] about the significance of ''sea power'' in world conflict.  The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its [[military–industrial complex]], and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it.  This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the [[Cold War]], underpinning military thinking about the creation of [[buffer state]]s between East and West in central Europe.

The heartland theory depicted a world divided into a ''Heartland'' (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); ''World Island'' (Eurasia and Africa); ''Peripheral Islands'' (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and ''New World'' (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], where buffer states were created between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]], to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland.  At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and [[Social Darwinism]].  He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live.  Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical [[science]], with an [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] view of the world.  Prior to [[World War II]] political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see [[Geopolitik]]) such as [[Karl Haushofer]] who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced [[Nazism|Nazi]] political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories.

The close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'.  Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach.  As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.

== Areas of study ==
[[File:13.8 scharf.png|thumb|right|The [[Brandenburg Gate]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.]]

From the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal ''Political Geography Quarterly'' (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as ''Political Geography''). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, [[Ron J. Johnston]]'s (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, [[Henry Bakis]] (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism.  However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War.  With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently.

Political geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life.  This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)).  Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp. 383-386.  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x &lt;/ref&gt;.

In particular, contemporary political geography often considers:
* How and why states are organized into regional groupings, both formally (e.g. the [[European Union]]) and informally (e.g. the [[Third World]])
* The relationship between states and former colonies, and how these are propagated over time, for example through [[neo-colonialism]]
* The relationship between a [[government]] and its people
* The relationships between states including international trades and treaties
* The functions, demarcations and policing of boundaries
* How [[imagined geographies]] have political implications
* The influence of political power on geographical space
* The political implications of modern media (e.g. radio, TV, ICT, Internet, social networks)
* The study of election results (electoral geography)

===Critical political geography===
{{See also|Critical geopolitics}}

Critical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis-a-vis modern trends.  As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from [[postmodern]], [[post structural]] and [[postcolonial]] theories&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include:
* [[Feminist geography]], which argues for recognition of the power relations as [[patriarchal]] and attempts to theorise alternative conceptions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J., 2007. Geography and gender: Finding feminist political geographies. Progress in Human Geography, 31(3), pp.381-387.&lt;/ref&gt;. Alongside related concerns such as [[Queer theory]] and [[Youth studies]]
* [[Postcolonial]] theories which recognise the [[Imperialistic]], universalising nature of much political geography, especially in [[Development geography]]&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J., 2003. Political geography in a postcolonial context. Political Geography, 22(6), pp.647-651.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Environmental justice]] which addresses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement|last=|first=|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=0262195526|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a human right for all people to share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Environmental Justice Reader: Politics, Poetics, &amp; Pedagogy|last=|first=|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|year=2002|isbn=0816522065|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Canada''''' is a 10-minute 1959 Canadian [[documentary film]], made by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) as part of the  postwar ''[[Canada Carries On]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner 1997, p. 1051.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, directed by Guy Glover, described the creation of the ''All Canadian Atlas''. The film's [[Canadian French|French]] version title is ''L'Atlas du Canada''.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Synopsis ==
Canadian mapmakers 400 years ago relied on hand-drawn maps derived from personal accounts by explorers, fur traders and settlers. These maps were limited to coastlines and partial interior views. Explorers like [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[Jacques Cartier]] and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] made their own maps. Later explorers and prospectors were often the first to go into uncharted regions, and their information on the land was invaluable in drawing up the maps of the time.

In 1959, the new ''All Canadian Atlas'' is a product of the joint efforts of geologists, meteorologists, prospectors, agronomists, draughtspersons, naturalists and especially, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Aerial photography was essential in mapping the vast north of Canada. In 1948, [[413 Transport and Rescue Squadron|No. 413 RCAF Squadron/No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron]] flying specially converted [[Avro Lancaster|Avro Lancaster 10P]] aircraft undertook the task of mapping Canada's Arctic. Three large islands were discovered and one island near [[Baffin Island]] was named "Air Force" in their honour.

With all the accumulated data from photographs, the mapmakers of the ''All Canadian Atlas'' consulted with interested parties from government, industry and [[academia]] to ensure that all relevant information is included. Each of the 500 maps contains a wealth of information, depicting Canada in a hundred different ways from political boundaries, settlement, urban development, habitats, mineral and agricultural areas, temperatures and climates, transportation and industry to provide an accurate portrait of Canada in the late 1950s.

==Production==
''Portrait of Canada'' was a [[short film|short]] informational documentary in the NFB's films ''Canada Carries On'' series (first created as a [[World War II|wartime]] series).&lt;ref name="CFE"&gt;Morris, Peter. [http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&amp;csid1=615&amp;navid=66 "Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On."]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canadian Film Encyclopedia''. Retrieved: February 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a [[compilation documentary]] that combined newsreel material with animated sequences and original footage, including aerial footage from the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Reception==
''Portrait of Canada'' was produced for television broadcast on [[CBC Television]]. Individual films were distributed worldwide by the NFB and were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Evans 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 199 films in the ''Canada Carries On'' series were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;Ohayon, Albert.

'''Precise Point Positioning''' (PPP) is a [[Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) [[GNSS positioning calculation|positioning method to calculate]] very precise positions up to few centimeter level using a single (GNSS) receiver in a dynamic and global reference framework like [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS). PPP methods are different from ([[Differential GPS|DGNSS]]) positioning methods which differentiate errors using one or more reference stations with known positions. The PPP approach combines precise clocks and orbits, so-called precise ephemeris,  calculated from a global network to calculate a precise position with a single receiver, which can be double or single frequency.

Historically precise positioning was associated with [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]]. It makes use of carrier-phase observables, allowing positioning precisions of a fraction of a carrier wavelength, 19 or 24 cm. It also makes use of precise ephemeris, generated by the geodetic community -- the IGS, [http://www.igs.org/ International GNSS Service] -- from measurements by a global network of tracking stations. Recently, the dissemination over the Internet in low-latency real time -- e.g., [http://apps.gdgps.net/ APPS], the Automatic Precise Positioning Service of NASA JPL -- has made possible to do such precise positioning also in real time, giving us the PPP technique.  

With the advent of [[Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS) such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), precise positioning has been incorporated into production processes in mining, agriculture and construction. The main application has been in [[machine guidance]] and machine automation which require high levels of precision.

Precise positioning is also increasingly used in the fields of [[robotics]] and autonomous navigation.

The commissioning of a new sacred building was a solemn occasion, and officials as high-ranking as the Pharaoh participated in a ceremony that involved personally stretching ropes to define the foundation. This important ceremony, and therefore rope-stretching itself, are attested over 3000 years from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic period]] to the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Kim and Michael J.

Rope stretching technology spread to [[ancient Greece]] and [[India]], where it stimulated the development of [[geometry]] and [[mathematics]].

A '''rutter''' is a mariner's handbook of written sailing directions.  Before the advent of [[nautical chart]]s, rutters were the primary store of geographic information for maritime [[navigation]].

It was known as a ''[[periplus]]'' ("sailing-around" book) in [[classical antiquity]] and a ''[[Portolan chart|portolano]]'' ("port book") to [[medieval]] Italian sailors in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Portuguese navigators of the 16th century called it a ''roteiro'', the French a ''routier'', from which the English word "rutter" is derived.  In Dutch, it was called a ''leeskarte'' ("reading chart"), in German a ''Seebuch'' ("sea book"), and in Spanish a ''derroterro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kemp|editor-first=Peter|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|year=1993|page=242|isbn=0192820842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before the advent of nautical charts in the 14th century, navigation at sea relied on the accumulated knowledge of [[navigator]]s and [[maritime pilot|pilot]]s. Plotting a course at sea required knowing the direction and distance between point A and point B. Knowledge of where places lay relative to each other was acquired by mariners during their long experience at sea.

The earliest [[periplus]]es of classical antiquity were not necessarily written as practical navigational handbooks. Some were more akin to an adventure travelogue, to celebrate a famous voyage.  Others were disguised as such, notably the ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'' from the 4th century BCE, which described the harbors and landmarks along the north African coast west of the [[Nile delta]].  Still others were designed as commercial guides for merchants, such as the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', written around 100 CE by a Greek merchant in Egypt, as a guide to the market ports of the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]].

The re-emergence of maritime commerce in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (12th–13th centuries), spearheaded by Italian ports like [[Amalfi]], [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]], led to the rise of a new set of handbooks, known as ''[[Portolan chart|portolani]]'' ("port books"), designed for the practical use of mariners.  These were likely first compiled by professional mariners and pilots, probably as a mnemonic set of notes for their own personal use.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, (1956: p. 103); Parry (1963: p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;  These notes were probably passed secretly within their profession ranks, from master to apprentice. Only a few of these Italian handbooks were made public, and even fewer have survived to this day.  The most complete surviving portolano is the famous ''Il compasso da navigare'', written c. 1250 and published in [[Genoa]] in 1296.

In their sailing instructions, Medieval portolan handbooks distinguished between various types of routes, e.g. ''per starea'' (coastal [[cabotage]]), ''per peleggio'' (open-sea sailing between two points).  Portolan handbooks expressed their sailing directions in terms [[compass rose]] points and distances.  The reliance on the [[magnetic compass]] (an instrument that only really began being used for navigation in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;) distinguishes the Medieval portolano from the earlier Classical periplus.

It is believed that the [[nautical chart]]s that suddenly emerged in [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Majorca]] and other maritime centers after the late 13th century were constructed from the written information contained in contemporary written pilot handbooks, hence the term ''[[portolan chart]]''s.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1949: p. 103), Taylor (1956: pp. 111–12). See also Lanman (1987) and Campbell (1987, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The wealth of detail contained in portolano handbooks is reflected in the portolan charts, stunningly accurate even by modern standards.

Handbooks often contained a wealth of information beyond sailing directions.  For instance, they frequently had detailed physical descriptions of shorelines, harbors, islands, channels, notes about tides, landmarks, reefs, shoals and difficult entries, instructions on how to use [[navigational instrument]]s to determine position and plot routes, calendars, astronomical tables,  mathematical tables and calculation rules (notably the [[rule of marteloio]]), lists of customs regulations at different ports, medical recipes, instructions on ship repair, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Edson (2007: 51)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the nautical chart never fully replaced the handbook, but remained supplementary to it.

Among notable rutters is the ''Grand Routier'', written by the French pilot [[Pierre Garcie]], c. 1483 and published in 1502–03, which focused on the shores of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[English Channel]], and its peculiarities.  Translated into English as the ''Rutter of the Sea'' in 1528, it was reprinted many times, and remained the pre-eminent rutter used by English sailors for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Waters (1985: p. 241); also Markham (1880: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BAoVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 355]). The first English edition (1528) of Garcie was entitled ''The Rutter of the Sea, with the laws of the yle of Auleron'' and translated by Robert Copeland.  Copies of the third edition (1541) contained "A rutter of the northe, compyled by Rychard Proude".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequently used rutter was the work ''Portolano'' by [[Pietro Coppo]], published in Venice in 1528, which included a collection of sea charts and the description of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istrianet.org/istria/illustri/coppo/index.htm |title=Prominent Istrians: Pietro Coppo |work=Istria on the Internet |publisher=Istrian American Charities Association, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppo was among the last to consider North America an archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=cv9-AAAAIAAJ |title=Narrative and Critical History of America ...: Spanish explorations and settlements in America from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. |page=128 |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Channing|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and co. |year=1886|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most dramatic rutter was the 1595 ''Reysgheschrift'' by Dutch sailor [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]].  Having sailed to the Asia aboard Portuguese ships, Linschoten publicized the sailing directions to the East Indies that had been assiduously kept secret by the Portuguese for nearly a century. The publication of Lischoten's rutter was an explosive sensation, and launched the race by a myriad of Dutch and English companies for the East Indies in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Koeman (1985), Schmidt (2001: p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Saxon milepost''' ({{lang-de|kursächsische Postmeilensäule}}, colloquially ''sächsische Postmeilensäule'' or ''Postsäule'') was a [[milepost]] in the former [[Electorate of Saxony]] that gave distances expressed as journey times to the nearest eighth of an hour. With one hour being the equivalent of one [[League (unit)#Comparison table|league]], this corresponds to a distance of about 566&amp;nbsp;m. The design of the mileposts varied according to the distance at which they were placed. They were hewn from natural stone into the shape of an [[obelisk]], an ancient [[herma]] or a [[stele]]. Their prototype was the [[Miliarium|Roman milepost]]. From its German name ''römische Meilensäule'' the rather inaccurate German description of ''Säule'' (lit.: "column") was derived. The Saxon head postal director (''Oberpostdirektor''), Paul Vermehren, brought about their inception based on official distance surveys, whose results were given in [[league (unit)|league]]s on the post mileposts. A league in Saxony at that time (1722 to 1840) was meant to be an hour's journey, equivalent to half a mile or 4.531 kilometres.

Saxon postal mileposts were set up during the reign of [[Augustus II of Poland|August the Strong]] and his successor along all important postal and trading routes and in almost all towns in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to indicate the official distances. This was intended to be the basis for the creation of a unified calculation of postal charges. Because the territory of the Electorate of Saxony was larger than that of the present-day German state of [[Saxony]], these mileposts are nowadays also found in the states of [[Thuringia]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], as well as in [[Poland]].

The locations and images of surviving or replaced Saxon mileposts may be seen in the [[:de:Galerie der kursächsischen Postmeilensäulen|Gallery of Saxon postal mileposts]].

== Forerunners ==
[[File:Hoelzerne Armen Saeulen.jpg|thumb|upright|Wooden Saxon mileposts (''"Chur-Sächßische Hölzerne Armen Säulen"'')]]
In 1695, the head of the Saxon post office, ''Oberpostmeister'' Ludwig Wilhelm, proposed a systematic survey of the road from [[Leipzig]] to [[Dresden]] with wooden, roadside posts at regular intervals. This prompted [[prince elector]] Augustus the Strong, on 18 June 1695, to order ''"that certain mileposts are to be erected"''. He charged the ''Kondukteur'' (building supervisor) Heinrich Niedhart with this task. The Electoral Saxon forestry superintendents were instructed to provide the wood, and the administrators of the electoral Saxon districts were to ensure that the posts were erected.

Furthermore, before 1700 wooden [[fingerpost]]s withs distance markings (so-called ''Arm(en)säulen'' or "arm columns") were commonplace on the roads of Saxony. These consisted of a wooden post, at the upper end of which were direction indicators in the shape of human arms and hands. Because the wood rotted rapidly as a result of its constant exposure to moisture, many of these fingerposts collapsed a few years after they had been erected and became unusable.

The establishment of postal mileposts in electoral Saxony was not an isolated phenomenon. Similar posts or stones with distances marked on them were erected along the roads in a number of countries.

== State survey by Zürner ==
[[File:Lauenstein Museum Schloss (2) 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Working replica of a surveying cart (''Messkarre'') for road surveying in the Eastern Ore Mountain Museum at [[Lauenstein (Altenberg)|Lauenstein Castle]]]]
The basis for the introduction of Saxon mileposts was the [[cartographic]] work of the pastor, [[Adam Friedrich Zürner]], from [[Großenhain|Skassa]]. Zürner had prepared a map of [[Großenhain]], which attracted the attention of Augustus the Strong. After further cartographic work, the prince elector gave him the task on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1713 of: "''recording districts, including the lordships, manor estates, towns, villages and the like, on geographic maps''" (original: "''Aemter samt denen darinnen befindlichen Herrschaften, Rittergütern, Städten, Dörfern und dergleichen mehr in mappas geographicas bringen''"). This entailed the [[topographic]] survey of Electoral Saxony. In addition to the heartland, it covered the electoral Saxon parts of the counties of [[County of Henneberg|Henneberg]] and [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfeld]], the [[House of Schönburg|Schönburg]] estates, the estates of the [[Ernestine and Albertine Wettins|Albertine]] branches of [[Saxe-Merseburg]], [[Saxe-Weissenfels]] and [[Saxe-Zeitz]] as well as the two [[Lusatia]]s.

The resulting cartographic material remained largely secret for several decades for [[military]] reasons. The prince elector only had an improved [[Mail|post]]al map published which was the result of an extension to the contract that followed a few weeks later. This "''Chur-Sächsische Post-Charte''", first published in 1718, and its subsequent editions, remained in use until the 19th century.

Because the distances stated at that time were frequently based on imprecise estimates, Zürner had to survey the distances afresh or verify existing data. To achieve that he designed a survey vehicle in the shape of an electoral Saxon baggage coach. Each revolution of the rear wheel of the coach with a circumference of one Dresden [[rod (unit)|rod]] (''Dresdner Rute''), i.e. 4.531&amp;nbsp;metres, was transmitted to a mechanical [[Counter (digital)|counter]] in the coach by means of a chain. Zürner's assistants used a measuring cart in the shape of a wheelbarrow for those tracks unsuitable for a coach, which likewise measured the distances by the turning of a wheel and which was carried as the so-called "fifth wheel on the wagon" (''fünftes Rad am Wagen'') in a case on the surveying coach. Both methods enabled a very accurate survey of roads.

[[File:Uebersicht Postmeilensaeulen.svg|thumb|Known locations of postal mileposts on a map of the Kingdom of Saxony before the [[Vienna Congress]], whose area of interest coincided largely with that of Electoral Saxony in 1814/15]]
Another problem was the lack of standard units of measurement. At that time there were [[mile]]s (''Meilen'') of various length even within the Electorate. To achieve standardization, the Electoral [[Saxon post mile]] was therefore introduced  on 17&amp;nbsp;March 1722, whereby 1&amp;nbsp;mile = 2&amp;nbsp;leagues = 2,000&amp;nbsp;Dresden&amp;nbsp;rods = 9.062&amp;nbsp;kilometres. To indicate distances on the mileposts, Zürner used the league (''Wegstunde''), which equalled a half mile.&lt;ref name = "Postmeilensaeulen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poststrassen-erleben.de/geschichten/historie-der-postsaeulen.html | title = Historie der Postsäulen | publisher = Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.V. und 1.

The survey journeys usually began in [[Leipzig]] or [[Dresden]], the counter being set to zero at the [[Post house (historical building)|posthouse]] in each city. As a result, a Leipzig or a Dresden distance is quoted. During such a journey, the assistant to the surveyor had to drive a numbered wooden stake into the ground every quarter of a mile and dig a hole next to it. The excavated material was then used to help fix the wooden post securely. The landowner was responsibility for looking after the survey stake.

In several cases the surveys were also conducted outside the territory of the electorate. Everywhere where Saxon land was interrupted by other territories, roads that were used by the Saxon post office were surveyed, with the permission of the territorial owner.

Surveying was especially difficult in [[Upper Lusatia]] because there the landowners of the [[estates of the realm]] tried to impede Zürner's activity. Zürner was able to begin surveying Upper and [[Lower Lusatia]] only on 29 June 1723. The survey work on the most important roads in the state was completed by 1733.

== Erection of the columns ==
[[File:Canaletto (I) 010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bernardo Bellotto]]: view of Dresden (detail); the moats and bridge between the Wilschem Gate and the template post milepost (without coat of arms) by [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]], ca. 1750]]
On 19&amp;nbsp;September 1721, an Electoral order was issued to the districts (''[[Ämter]]'') of Dresden, [[Meißen]] and [[Amt Hayn (Großenhain)|Großenhain]], to erect stone columns as mileposts. On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1721, this order was extended to the entire state. On the same day the state authorities in charge issued the general ordinance for the "Establishment of Stone Postal Columns" (''Setzung der steinernen Post-Säulen'') and the instruction that the costs of erecting them were to be borne by the landowner of the locations affected. For Upper Lusatia, a separate instruction followed on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1721.

Zürner, who had been tasked by Augustus the Strong on 14 December 1721, worked out himself the details of which mileposts were to be erected. Zürner set forth that a large distance column (''Distanzsäule'') was to be erected immediately in front of the gates of a town. Similarly there were to be quarter-mile, half-mile and whole-mile stones at the corresponding intervals. In the Saxon part of the [[County of Henneberg]] cast iron posts were erected instead of the usual stone columns, and in the [[County of Mansfeld]] there were no mileposts at all.

Originally about 300 distance mileposts and around 1,200 other roadside mileposts were erected. About 200 of them have at least partly survived or have been faithfully reconstructed. Replicas were increasingly made after 1990.

Today the Saxon section of the [[Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road]] is considered the historic transport link with the most surviving postal mileposts.

The material used for the mileposts in Saxony varies widely. They were usually made from the prevailing building stone of the local area, which is also reflected in the building materials used in Saxony's architecture in general. [[Elbe sandstone]] from several quarries in [[Saxon Switzerland]] and the area of the [[Tharandt Forest]] was used for most of the stones. Other frequently used materials were [[Rhyolite tuff|Rochlitz porphyry]] in Central Saxony and [[Lusatian granite]] in eastern Saxony. In the Chemnitz area, Hilbersdorf [[Tuff|porphyritic tuff]] quarried at [[Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf|Hilbersdorf]] and [[Flöha]] was used as a milepost material In the upper [[Ore Mountains]] and the [[Vogtland]] mileposts were made of local [[granite]], for example, [[Thermalbad Wiesenbad|Wiesenbad]] Granite, granite of the [[Greifensteine]] area, [[Rockelmann|Schwarzenberg]] Granite, [[Kirchberg (Saxony)#Geology|Kirchberg]] Granite or [[Kapellenberg (Vogtland)|Bad Brambach]] Granite of the "[[Fichtelgebirge]] type". The different weathering properties of these diverse types of stone proves to be a challenge for the conservation of these monuments in many cases. This is also the reason why numerous mileposts no longer exist.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Herrmann: ''Steinbruchindustrie und Steinbruchgeologie''. 1st ed., Berlin, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
[[File:BGH PM-Säule (7) 2006-07-24.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms and inscription block of the distance milespost in [[Berggießhübel]]]]
Both the costs and the responsibility for erecting the mileposts had to be borne by the authorities of the respective towns and villages. As a result, the measures did not gain universal approval throughout the land. Because the means of the towns varied considerably depending on their size and industrial structure, the financial impact on them was very variable. Regardless of their size, they often had a similar number of town gates and therefore a comparable number of milestone columns to put up. Frequently there were three to five gates. In 1722, the [[Landtag of Saxony|Saxon ''Landtag'']] asked the prince elector to cancel the expensive project that had invoked the opposition of many town councils and landowners. Many towns tried to ignore the edict or delay its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 99, 100, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enforce the implementation of his instructions, the elector had resort to harsh measures and threatened negligence, tardiness or damage to the mileposts with disciplinary action in an order of 24 July 1722; and in another edict of 7 September 1724, fines of 20 talers were imposed against every official guilty of missing deadlines and in each individual case of neglect. Especially on the roads of Central Saxony, in the towns of  [[Colditz]], [[Grimma]], [[Oschatz]], [[Rochlitz]] and [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]], as well as the routes from these towns to Leipzig and thence [[Zeitz]] the gaps were particularly noticeable and were, in a decree of 7 September, subject to public reprimand by the prince elector.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this dispute, many places strove to erect one milepost column only. Zürner knew the location of many small towns and villages very precisely. During the course of his project, he proceeded to support the towns in their requests and advocated the elector's consent. In many cases their requests were granted. On the national roads, therefore, only wooden mileposts were erected or existing ones repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1727 the practice of erecting one column per town was carried out in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the order dated 19 September 1721 incorporated a comprehensive memorandum of 24 items and was accompanied by a list of the benefits of the regulation, it appears that problems had been anticipated from the outset. For example, as advantages of the national survey, the memorandum called pointed out that the payment of ''"delivery men, relay services, postal items and other goods"'' would be verifiable and the prices could no longer be fixed arbitrarily, that there would be fewer complaints from travellers about high fees that had hitherto taken up the time of courts and higher authorities, and that journey times and delivery times would be precisely defined by the survey. Another argument was that the roads would be more easily recognisable in the winter and at night.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the postal mileposts was especially strong in [[Upper Lusatia]]. In 1723, the [[town council]]s of [[Bautzen]] and [[Görlitz]] refused to entertain Zürner in this matter. Not until 31&amp;nbsp;March 1724 did the estates of Upper Lusatia declare themselves ready to carry out the instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because mileposts were occasionally damaged or even knocked down, an order was issued in 1724 that such crimes would be punished by imprisonment and other "hard and exemplary punishments".&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to persistent opposition the Saxon Landtage was finally able to issue a decree on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1728 that - contrary to the Elector's wishes - the mileposts need only be erected on main and postal roads.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:PMS-Arten.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the types of milepost, 1747]]
To what extent Augustus the Strong was personally involved in the development of the designs for the mileposts is not clear. Their final appearance, which was based on [[baroque (architecture)|baroque]] and [[classical antiquity|classical]] prototypes, was linked to the senior state architect (''Oberlandesbaumeister''), [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kursaechsische-postmeilensaeulen.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=68 vgl.

=== Distance mileposts ===
The large distance mileposts (''Distanzsäule'') comprised seven elements.  The [[pedestal]] was formed by the [[plinth]], [[dado (architecture)|dado]] and [[cornice]] (or cap). The column consists of the base (''Zwischenplatte'' or ''Schaftfuß''), the shaft, a block sowing the coat of arms (''Wappenstück''), and the finial (''Aufsatz'' or ''Spitze''). The columns have an average height of 8&amp;nbsp;ells (4.53&amp;nbsp;metres) and rest on a pedestal half an ell high. The individual elements were held together by means of iron pegs cast in lead. On the shaft of the column the names of the destinations were inscribed at Zürner's direction in a [[Fraktur]] font and based on the distance tables that had been worked out for each town. Several routes crossed state borders, and this was indicated by the letters ''gr'' (for ''Grenze'' or "border") or a horizontal line. Part of the inscription on all columns was a [[post horn]] on all four sides, which was the emblem of the state's postal sovereignty. The arms of the Electorate of Saxony with a gilded crown and the Polish royal crown with the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|royal Polish-Lithuanian]] coat of arms were shown on the superstructure.

The mileposts originally erected in front of the town gates usually had the distances marked on two sides and the names of the destination towns on the other two sides. Later columns, erected in the market squares, had the distances marked on all four sides.

=== Full mile stone ===
The full mile stone (''Ganzmeilensäule'') was to mark every full mile along the post road. It is about 3.75 metres high and resembles the large distance milepost in shape. They are however more slender and have no section showing the coat of arms. The information was inscribed on two sides so that travellers in both directions could read them. On the road side was the so-called serial number (''Reihennummer'') with which all roadside columns and mileposts were numbered in sequence. Because a number was assigned every quarter of a mile, each full-milepost had a serial number divisible by four.

=== Half mile stone ===
The half mile stone (''Halbmeilensäule''), also called the league post (''Stundensäule'') because the league corresponded to half a mile, had a lower pedestal surmounted by a shaft that tapered from top to bottom. A roof-shaped, chamfered finial formed the uppermost element. Its total height is about 3 metres. It bore the same inscriptions as the full mile stone. The [[herm]]-like design of this column is a reason why only a few stones of this type have survived until today.&lt;!-- need to find out why --&gt; The serial number is even, but not divisible by four.

=== Quarter mile stone ===
The quarter mile stone (''Viertelmeilenstein'') rests on a low pedestal and consists of a rectangular column or stele. Its total height is about 1.7 metres. There are no inscriptions on these mileposts other than the monogram "AR", a [[post horn]] symbol, the year of manufacture and, on the narrow side facing the road, the serial number which was an odd number.

[[Old weights and measures (Saxony)|Preparations]] for the introduction of the [[metric system]] in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] were made as part of the work of the Standardization Commission (''Normalaichungscommission''), led by Albert Christian Weinlig and Julius Ambrosius Hülße. These two men envisaged a transition phase from the old units. Almost simultaneously, similar efforts were being made at the level of the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Domsch: ''Albert Christian Weinlig. Ein Lebensbild nach Familienpapieren und Akten.'' Chemnitz 1912 (Abhandlungen und Berichte der Technischen Staatslehranstalten in Chemnitz, Heft 2), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz- und Verordnungsblatt für das Königreich Saxony, 1858, 12 March 1858 ''No. 18, Gesetz, die Einführung eines allgemeinen Landesgewichts und einige Bestimmungen über das Maaß- und Gewichtswesen im Allgemeinen betreffend''.&lt;/ref&gt; A new survey was carried out in 1858, and between 1859 and 1865 a new system of milestones – the [[:de:Galerie der königlich-sächsischen Meilensteine|Royal Saxon milestones]] were made in the shape of station milestones (''Stationssteine''), full mile, half mile, junction (''Abzweig-'') and border crossing stones (''Grenzübergangssteine''), noting that, from 1840, 1 mile = 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. Upon the full introduction of the metric system around 1900, some of these were converted to kilometer, [[chaussee]], boundary (''Flurgrenz'') and roadkeeper stones (''Straßenwärtersteine'').

The '''Sea Level Datum of 1929''' was the vertical control [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] established for vertical control [[surveying]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] by the General Adjustment of 1929.  The datum was used to measure [[elevation]] ([[altitude]]) above, and [[depression (geology)|depression]] ([[:wikt:depth|depth]]) below, [[mean sea level]] (MSL).

Mean sea level was measured at 26 tide gauges: 21 in the United States and 5 in [[Canada]].  The datum was defined by the observed heights of mean sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all bench marks resulting from the adjustment.  The adjustment required a total of 66,315 miles (106,724&amp;nbsp;km) of leveling with 246 closed circuits and 25 circuits at sea level.

Since the Sea Level Datum of 1929 was a hybrid model, it was not a pure model of [[mean sea level]], the [[geoid]], or any other [[equipotential]] surface.  Therefore, it was renamed the '''National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929''' (NGVD 29) in 1973.  NGVD29 was superseded by the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]), based upon an equipotential definition and a readjustment, although many cities and [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] projects with established data continued to use the older datum.

'''Softscape''' refers to the live [[horticulture|horticultural]] elements of a [[landscape]]. Softscaping can include, flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, flower beds, and duties like weed/nuisance management, grading, planting, mowing, trimming, aerating, spraying, and digging for everything from plants and shrubs , to flower beds. Wheel barrows and manual tools like rakes, shovels, picks, and gas power tools are commonly used. This is a term that has been popularized in recent pop culture (2006 onwards) on television shows such as [[Home &amp; Garden Television]]. The purpose of softscape is to lend character to the landscaping, create an aura, ambience, and reflect the sensibilities of the inhabitants. 

The term softscape stands in contrast to [[hardscape]] which represents inanimate objects of a landscape such as : pavers, stones, rocks,planter boxes, arbors , water feature as well as structures  of wood and natural stone and concrete, like: retaining walls, patios, fences and decks, pergolas, stairs, Etc

Subsea markers are passive identification markers used under water to identify equipment. As sub sea equipment may be covered in underwater growth like seaweed, kelp and algae, special non-fouling materials are necessary for equipment marking to ensure these are readable even after prolonged periods of submergence.

== How it works ==

Subsea markers are made from a durable rubber which has been manufactured to include synthetic oils. The oil is evenly distributed through the material and gives the material excellent [[hydrophobic]] properties. The [[hydrophobic]] properties of the material prevent marine growth from attaching to the surface of the marker making it readable even after several years of submersion under water.

== Applications ==

Subsea markers are typically used to identify the following equipment and
the equipment placed on them:
* valves
* [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas trees]]
* manifolds
* pipelines
* caps and connectors
* chemical injection/distribution units
* pressure caps and connectors

Alternative uses are for marking fish like sharks and whales. Subsea markers could also be used in sewage systems or to mark shipwrecks for divers.

'''TerraServer''' is a commercial website{{ref|website}} specializing in [[Aerial imagery|aerial]] and [[satellite imagery]] which was originally launched in 1997.  It is owned and operated by '''TerraServer.com, Inc.''' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  The company was previously named '''Aerial Images''' until May 2002 when the assets of Aerial Images were sold and the company renamed itself TerraServer.com, Inc.

==History==
Aerial Images was a part of the original project that involved [[Microsoft]] and [[Compaq]] as a demonstration of the real-world scalability of [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] and Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] Server.  Aerial Images brought in satellite imagery from Sovinformsputnik (the Russian Federal Space Agency) and [[GeoEye]]. TerraServer expanded its partnerships and became an image provider for LandVoyage and the [[DigitalGlobe]] family of companies: [[GlobeXplorer]] and AirPhotoUSA, as well as imagery from the [[USGS]] and [[USDA]].

After an agreement that ended in January 2000, the operations split into two pieces. Aerial Images kept the TerraServer.com domain name to create a commercial site selling custom selected imagery. Microsoft went forward with their own imagery project, which provides access to [[United States Geological Survey]] imagery. The Microsoft project used the TerraServer brand name in a variety of ways including terraserver.homeadvisor.com, terraserver.microsoft.com, and terraserver.msn.com.  In 2003, Microsoft [[wikt:Rebrand|rebranded]] its research service as [[TerraServer-USA]], and then [[Microsoft Research Maps]]. There may exist confusion between the two sites, because of the name similarity. However, TerraServer.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the registered trademark '''TerraServer'''. The "TerraServer" name is a reference to 'Terra', which is Latin for 'earth' or 'land'.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==Website==
The TerraServer viewer allows users to select imagery from different dates and of different resolutions. While most of the TerraServer imagery is focused on high resolution, color, satellite and aerial imagery, TerraServer.com also offers [[Infrared photography|Color Infrared Imagery]], [[Panchromatic film|Panchromatic Imagery]], Low Resolution Satellite Imagery, and [[topographic map]]s.  Subscribers to TerraServer.com gain access to a drawing and measuring tool that can measure surface distance and area on the images. TerraServer also makes a number of image overlays available, including road names, FEMA flood data, earthquake data, landslide data, real estate parcels, parks, schools, hospitals, airports, and zip codes.

'''Tidal diamonds''' are symbols on British [[admiralty chart]]s that indicate the direction and speed of [[tide|tidal streams]].

The symbols consist of a letter of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] in a [[rhombus]], printed in purple ink. On any particular chart each tidal diamond will have a unique letter starting from "A" and continuing alphabetically.

Somewhere on the chart, generally on land, will be a ''Tidal Diamond table''. This contains a grid of thirteen rows and three columns for each Diamond. The rows are the hours of the tidal cycle showing the 6 hours before [[high water]], high water itself and the 6 hours after high water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/EASYTIDE/EasyTide/Support/faq.aspx EasyTide - on-line tidal predictions from the UKHO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The columns show the [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of the tidal stream and its speed, in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s, at both [[spring tide]] and [[neap tide]]. The times on the table are related to the high water of the [[standard port]] displayed on the table.

An alternative to a '''tidal diamond''' is a [[tidal atlas]] which are often more accurate and easier to use (if available).
