{{broader|Academic tenure}}
In the United States and Canada, '''tenure''' is a [[contractual right]] that grants a [[teacher]] or [[professor]] permanent position or employment. It is given as a legal protection against summary dismissal without just cause. Tenure encouraged the development of ideas and thoughts, even if they are not popular among the community. In those countries, tenure is granted only to professors and teachers who prove to be exceptionally productive in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title = Tenure {{!}} AAUP|website = www.aaup.org|access-date = 2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nea.org/home/33067.htm|title = The Truth About Tenure in Higher Education|website = NEA|access-date = 2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tenure (colleges and universities)==
Under the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm "Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure"].&lt;/ref&gt;) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to be not "tenure track." Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Academic tenure's original purpose was to guarantee the right to [[academic freedom]]: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from prevailing opinion, openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics. Thus academic tenure is similar to the lifetime tenure that protects some judges from external pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe!openform&amp;nav=menu1&amp;page=/federal/courts.nsf/page/183 |title=Inside the Federal Courts |author=[[Federal Judicial Center]] |accessdate=2015-04-06 |quote=Federal judges appointed under Article III of the Constitution are guaranteed what amounts to life tenure and unreduced salary so that they won’t be afraid to make an unpopular decision. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414082048/http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe%21openform%26nav%3Dmenu1%26page%3D/federal/courts.nsf/page/183 |archivedate=2015-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without job security, the scholarly community as a whole may experience pressure to favor noncontroversial lines of academic inquiry. The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions as they see fit and to report their honest conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Reis, Richard. (1997) ''[http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0780311361,miniSiteCd-IEEE2.html Tomorrow's Professor: Preparing for Academic Careers in Science and Engineering]''. [[Wiley-IEEE Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-7803-1136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has also become a type of job security for professors.

In North American universities and colleges, the tenure track has long been a defining feature of professorial employment, although it is less than universal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilt.ilstu.edu/jhreid/isuaaup/tenure.htm "White Paper #1 - Tenure"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906042450/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/jhreid/isuaaup/tenure.htm |date=September 6, 2006 }} Illinois State University’s AAUP.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=2576 "Transient professors: How important is tenure?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235306/http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=2576 |date=September 27, 2007 }} Evelyn Shih (2003) The Yale Herald.&lt;/ref&gt; In North American universities, positions that carry tenure, or the opportunity to attain tenure, have grown more slowly than non-tenure-track positions, leading to a large "academic underclass".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unr.edu/homepage/jtr/tenure.html "Tenure in the new millennium: Still a valuable concept"] James T. Richardson (1999) National Forum (see section on "Split labour theory in academe").&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most US universities currently supplement the work of tenured professors with the services of non-tenured [[Professor#Other positions|adjunct professors]], academics who teach classes for lower wages and fewer employment benefits under relatively short-term contracts. For those that are tenure track, it generally takes about seven years to earn tenure while working as an [[assistant professor]]. Tenure is determined by a combination of research, teaching, and service, with each factor weighted according to the values of a particular university, college or department. There is some evidence that professors that share more (e.g. via [[open access]] publications, [[open data]], or [[open source hardware]] development) gain an advantage in obtaining tenure because they are cited more and can thus develop a higher [[h-index]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua M. Pearce]], “Open Source Hardware in Academia” in Alicia Gibb (Ed.) ''Building Open Source Hardware: DIY Manufacturing for Hackers and Makers'', Addison-Wesley: New York, pp. 253-277 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; This competition for limited resources could lead to ethically questionable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M.S. |last1=Anderson |first2=E.A. |last2=Ronning |first3=R. |last3=de Vries |first4=B.C. |last4=Martison |title=The perverse effects of competition on scientists' work and relationship |journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |issue=13 |volume=4 |pages=437–461 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s11948-007-9042-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11948-015-9638-0|first=M. van|last=Wesel |title=Evaluation by Citation: Trends in Publication Behavior, Evaluation Criteria, and the Strive for High Impact Publications|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|issue=1|volume=22|pages=199–225|year=2016 |pmc=4750571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the United States ==

===19th century===
In the 19th century, university professors largely served at the pleasure of the [[board of trustees]] of the university. Sometimes, major [[Donation|donors]] could successfully remove professors or prohibit the hiring of certain individuals; nonetheless, a ''de facto'' tenure system existed. Usually professors were only fired for interfering with the [[religion|religious]] [[principle]]s of a college, and most boards were reluctant to discipline professors. The courts rarely intervened in dismissals.

In one debate of the [[Cornell University]] Board of Trustees in the 1870s, a businessman trustee argued against the prevailing system of ''de facto'' tenure, but lost the argument. Despite the power retained in the board, [[academic freedom]] prevailed. Another example is the 1894 case of [[Richard T. Ely]], a [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] professor who advocated labor strikes and labor law reform. Though the Wisconsin legislature and business interests pressed for his dismissal, the board of trustees of the university passed a resolution committing itself to academic freedom, and to retaining him (without tenure):

&lt;blockquote&gt;In all lines of academic investigation it is of the utmost importance that the investigator should be absolutely free to follow the indications of truth wherever they may lead. Whatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere we believe the great state University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/WIReader/WER1035-Chpt1.html |title=WER: Sifting and Winnowing [Chapter 1&amp;#93; |publisher=Library.wisc.edu |date=1998-01-01 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The notorious case of the dismissal of [[G. B. Halsted]] by the [[University of Texas]] in 1903 after nineteen years of service may have accelerated the adoption of the tenure concept.

A later case at [[Rollins College]], widely publicized and investigated by the [[American Association of University Professors]], which censured Rollins, also played a role in establishing the validity of the tenure concept.&lt;ref&gt;"Academic Freedom and Tenure: Rollins College," in ''The Case for Tenure'', ed. Matthew W. Finkin, Cornell University Press, 1996; Mary Seymour, "The Ghosts of Rollins (and Other Skeletons in the Closet)," ''Rollins Magazine'', Fall 2013, http://www.rollins.edu/magazine/fall-2011/ghosts-of-rollins-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This case led breakaway professors to found the innovative and influential [[Black Mountain College]].

===From 1900 to 1940===
In 1900, the presidents of [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Chicago]] each made clear that no donor could any longer dictate faculty decisions; such a donor's contribution would be unwelcome. In 1915, this was followed by the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) declaration of principles—the traditional justification for academic freedom and tenure.

The AAUP's declaration of principles recommended that:
* Trustees raise faculty salaries, but not bind their consciences with restrictions.
* Only committees of other faculty members can judge a member of the faculty. This would also insulate higher administration from external accountability decisions.
* Faculty appointments be made by other faculty and chairpersons, with three elements:
*# Clear employment contracts
*# formal academic tenure, and
*# clearly stated grounds for dismissal.

While the AAUP pushed reform, tenure battles were a campus non-issue. In 1910, a survey of 22 universities showed that most professors held their positions with "presumptive permanence". At a third of colleges, assistant professor appointments were considered permanent, while at most colleges multi-year appointments were subject to renewal. Only at one university did a governing board ratify a president's decisions on granting tenure.

Tenure is also offered in many states to public [[schoolteacher]]s. [[Louisiana]], under state education superintendent [[T. H. Harris]], led the move to establish a teacher protection policy in the 1930s because of past political considerations in hiring and dismissal of educators.

===From 1940 to 1972===
In 1940, the AAUP recommended that the academic tenure probationary period be seven years—still the current norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggested that a tenured professor could not be dismissed without adequate cause, except "under extraordinary circumstances, because of financial emergencies." Also, the statement recommended that the professor be given the written reasons for dismissal and an opportunity to be heard in self-defense. Another purpose of the academic tenure probationary period was raising the performance standards of the faculty by pressing new professors to perform to the standard of the school's established faculty.

The most significant adoption of academic tenure occurred after 1945, when the influx of returning [[GI (term)|GIs]] returning to school led to quickly expanding universities with severe professorial faculty shortages. These shortages dogged the Academy for ten years, and that is when the majority of universities started offering formal tenure as a side benefit. The rate of tenure (percent of tenured university faculty) increased to 52 percent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In fact, the demand for professors was so high in the 1950s that the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] held a conference in [[Cuba]] noting the too-few doctoral candidates to fill positions in English departments. During the [[McCarthy era]], loyalty oaths were required of many state employees, and neither formal academic tenure nor the Constitutional principles of freedom of speech and association were protection from dismissal. Some professors were dismissed for their political affiliations. During the 1960s, many professors supported the [[anti-war movement]] against the [[Vietnam War]], and more than 20 state legislatures passed resolutions calling for specific professorial dismissals and a change to the academic tenure system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===From 1972 to the present===
Two landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cases changed tenure in 1972: (i) ''[[Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth]]'', 408 US 564; and (ii) ''[[Perry v. Sindermann]]'', 408 US 593. These two cases held that a professor's claim to entitlement must be more than a subjective expectancy of continued employment. Rather, there must be a contractual relationship or a reference in a contract to a specific tenure policy or agreement. Further, the court held that a tenured professor who is discharged from a public college has been deprived of a property interest, and so due process applies, requiring certain procedural safeguards (the right to personally appear in a hearing, the right to examine evidence and respond to accusations, the right to have advisory counsel).

Later cases specified other bases for dismissal: (i) if a professor's conduct were incompatible with his duties (''Trotman v. Bd. of Trustees of Lincoln Univ.'', 635 F.2d 216 (2d Cir.1980)); (ii) if the discharge decision is based on an objective rule (''Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of U. Wisc. Sys.'', 377 F. Supp 277, (W.D. Wisc. 1974)). After these cases were judged, the number of reported cases in the matter of academic tenure increased more than two-fold: from 36 cases filed during the decade 1965–1975, to 81 cases filed during the period 1980–1985.

During the 1980s there were no notable tenure battles, but three were outstanding in the 1990s. In 1995, the [[Florida Board of Regents]] tried to re-evaluate academic tenure, but managed only to institute a weak, post-tenure performance review. Likewise, in 1996 the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] attempted to re-evaluate tenure, fearing that few full-time professors actually taught university undergraduate students, mainly because the processes of achieving academic tenure underweighted teaching.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, faculty and administrators defended themselves and the board of trustees dropped its review. Finally, the University of Minnesota Regents tried from 1995 to 1996 to enact 13 proposals, including these policy changes: to allow the regents to cut faculty base- salaries for reasons other than a university financial emergency including poor performance; to fire tenured professors when their programs were eliminated or restructured if the university were unable to retrain or reassign them. In the Minnesota system, 87 percent of university faculty were either tenured or on the tenure track, and the professors vehemently defended themselves. Eventually, the president of the system opposed these changes and weakened a compromise plan by the dean of the law school before it then failed. The board chairman resigned later that year.

The period since 1972 has seen a steady decline in the percentage of college and university teaching positions in the US that are either tenured or tenure-track. United States Department of Education statistics put the combined tenured/tenure-track rate at 56% for 1975, 46.8% for 1989, and 31.9% for 2005. That is to say, by the year 2005, 68.1% of US college teachers were neither tenured nor eligible for tenure; a full 48% of teachers that year were part-time employees.

==Revocation==

In 1994, a study in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' found that "about 50 tenured professors [in the US] are dismissed each year for cause."&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn J. Mooney, "Dismissals for Cause", ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', December 7, 1994, p. A17.&lt;/ref&gt;
While tenure protects the occupant of an academic position, it does not protect against the elimination of that position. For example, a university that is under financial stress may take the drastic step of eliminating or [[downsize|downsizing]] some departments, in which case both tenured and untenured faculty are let go.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Saltzman,' Dismissals, Layoffs, and Tenure Denials in Colleges and Universities' http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_08_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants =Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill| vol =470| reporter =U.S.| opinion =532| date =1985|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/532}}&lt;/ref&gt; determined that a tenured teacher cannot be dismissed without oral or written notice regarding the charges against him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Id.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court held that the employer must provide an explanation of the employer's decision, including a discussion of the employer's evidence, and the teacher must be given an opportunity for a fair and meaningful hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Id.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of tenure for school teachers==
In 2012, tenure for school teachers was challenged in a California lawsuit called ''[[Vergara v. California]]''. The primary issue in the case was the impact of tenure on student outcomes and on equity in education.  On June 10, 2014, the trial judge ruled that California's teacher tenure statute produced disparities that "[[Shocks the conscience|shock the conscience]]" and violate the equal protection clause of the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]]. On July 7, 2014, [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] commented on the ''Vergara'' decision during a meeting with President [[Barack Obama]] and representatives of teacher's unions. Duncan said that tenure for school teachers "should be earned through demonstrated effectiveness" and should not be granted too quickly. Specifically, he criticized the 18-month tenure period at the heart of the ''Vergara'' case as being too short to be a "meaningful bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Earle | first = Geoff | title = Duncan digs at California teacher tenure during Obama meeting | newspaper = New York Post | date = July 7, 2014 | url = https://nypost.com/2014/07/07/duncan-digs-at-california-teacher-tenure-during-obama-meeting/ | accessdate = November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that sometimes it costs money to fire a bad teacher and that the teacher tenure has only become as a scapegoat law to not go through the process of hearings and documentations.&lt;ref name="Zirkel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirkel|first1=P. A.|title=Teacher Tenure Is Not the Real Problem|journal=The Phi Delta Kappan|date=2010|volume=92|pages=76–77|jstor=25753636|doi=10.1177/003172171009200116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of tenure for college professors==
The AAUP (American Association of University Professors) has handled hundreds of cases where it alleges that tenure candidates were treated unfairly. The AAUP has censured many major and minor universities and colleges for such alleged tenure abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Censure.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717173943/http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Censure.htm |date=July 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/allcen.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419090428/http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/allcen.htm |date=April 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/|title=Censure List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenure at many universities depends primarily on research publications and research grants although the universities' official policies are that tenure depends on research, teaching and service.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, E.L. 1990. ''Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate.'' Princeton, NJ: The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; The demand that a professor show exemplary production in research is intense. Unless a professor's research is in pedagogy (for instance within a School of Education), articles in refereed teaching journals and obtaining teaching grants often do not contribute greatly towards tenure, as the research is not focused on the professor's creating new knowledge in his or her home discipline.

At some universities the department chairperson sends forward the department recommendation on tenure. There have been cases, such as one case at The University of Texas at San Antonio (2008), where the faculty voted unanimously to tenure an individual but the chairperson sent forward a recommendation not to grant tenure despite the faculty support. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Tenure decisions can result in fierce political battles. In one tenure battle at [[Indiana University]], an untenured professor was accused of threatening violence against those who opposed his promotion, his wife briefly went on a hunger strike, and many called for the entire department to be disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/v46/i48/48a01201.htm Alleged Death Threats, a Hunger Strike, and a Department at Risk Over a Tenure Decision''] Courtney Leatherman (2000). Chronicle of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another instance in February 2010, [[Amy Bishop]] with the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] shot and killed colleagues after losing her appeal for tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Huntsville-Official-Tried-to/64215/ Huntsville Official Tried to Calm Amy Bishop in Phone Call About Her Future''] Paul Basken (2010). Chronicle of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. (1971) The Campus War: A Sympathetic Look at the Campus In Agony. World Publishing Company, ASIN: B0006CPN0E&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher [[John Searle]] has called for major changes to tenure systems, calling the practice "without adequate justification." Searle suggests that to reduce [[publish or perish]] pressures that can hamper their classroom teaching, capable professors be given tenure much sooner than the standard four-to-six years. However, Searle also argued that tenured professors be reviewed every seven years to help eliminate "incompetent" teachers who can otherwise find refuge in the tenure system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/opinion/article_92749dfc-4d18-52a6-8d3b-d181fd015344.html|title=Profs’ tenure under fire|work=Daily Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that tenure may have the effect of diminishing political and academic freedom among those seeking it – that they must appear to conform to the political or academic views of the field or the institution where they seek tenure. For example, in ''[[The Trouble with Physics]]'', the theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]] says ''"...it is practically career suicide for young theoretical physicists not to join the field of string theory...."''. It is certainly possible to view the tenure track as a long-term demonstration of the candidate's political and academic conformity. [[Patrick Michaels|Patrick J. Michaels]], a controversial{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} part-time climate science research professor at the University of Virginia, wrote: "...tenure has had the exact opposite effect as to its stated goal of diversifying free expression. Instead, it stifles free speech in the formative years of a scientist's academic career, and all but requires a track record in support of paradigms that might have outgrown their usefulness."&lt;ref&gt;Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming, Patrick J. Michaels, Chap. 11 p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this point of view would tend to argue not against the abolition of the tenure system, but the shortening of the probationary period, since after receiving tenure, professors no longer feel the pressure to conform to their discipline's mainline views.

Other criticisms include the [[publish or perish]] pressures creating trivial or junk research, a caste system treating those without tenure poorly, and indolence after having achieved tenure. The tenured faculty can resist necessary reforms by administrators who they generally outlast. The tenured faculty also usually can control appointments which contributes to [[political correctness]] and [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;The Faculty Lounges and Other Reasons Why You Won’t Get the College Education You Paid For, The Faculty Lounges and Other Reasons Why You Won’t Get the College Education You Paid For, Ivan R Dee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As more academics publish research in [[Internet]] and [[multimedia]] formats, organizations such as the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and [[Modern Language Association]] have recommended changes to promotion and tenure criteria, and some university departments have made such changes to reflect the increasing importance of networked scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/leon.2009.42.1.71 "New Criteria for New Media"] [[Joline Blais]], et al. (2009) Leonardo (Cambridge: MIT Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Ward Churchill]] controversy, a telephone survey of “a thousand Americans aged 18 and older” by the American Association of University Professors found that, while “generally supportive of the tenure system”,  "only about 17.9 percent of respondents say the tenure system should remain as it is".&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons, [http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/DCF3EBD7-509E-47AB-9AB3-FBCFFF5CA9C3/0/2006Gross.pdf "Americans’ Views of Political Bias In The Academy And Academic Freedom"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll found that 65% believed that "non-tenured professors are more motivated to do a good job in the classroom".&lt;ref&gt;Wages of Ward:Academy Exposed, David French, July 30, 2007, New York Post&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2012}}

The root of some of these criticisms is that elsewhere in the world, there are very few tenure systems, and no time-limited employment. The system in the rest of the English speaking world, for example, is based on promotion up union-negotiated payscales, usually with automatic advancement towards the top of a grade, with the luckier faculty members being on 'permanent contracts' with no end-date. To go to the next grade (e.g. from associate professor to professor), an application must be submitted, and the criteria are as exacting as in North America. Simon Batterbury argues this system offers less opportunity for sabotage, and more adherence to social justice goals, even though 'permanent' staff members can be fired at any time.&lt;ref&gt;http://simonbatterbury.net/pubs/tenurebatterbury.pdf Batterbury, S.P.J. 2008.

The '''Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua''' ({{IPA-ca|akaˈðɛmia valensiˈana ðe la ˈʎeŋɡwa|va}}, English: Valencian Language Academy), also known by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] '''AVL''', is an institution created on September 16, 1998, by the [[Corts Valencianes|Valencian Parliament]], which belongs to the set of official institutions that compose the [[Generalitat Valenciana]], according to the Act of Autonomy of the [[Valencian Community]].

Its primary function is to determine and set the official standards for the [[Valencian language]] as used in the [[Valencian Community]] ([[names of Catalan language|known]] in other territories as [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), and foster its use. According to its foundational law, the AVL linguistic regulations for Valencian must follow current Valencian genuine linguistic reality, respect Valencian lexicographic and literary tradition and start from the consolidated regulations based upon the [[Normes de Castelló]], a set of orthographic rules for Valencian signed in 1932.

The headquarters of the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua are in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia city]].
In addition this variety of the language follows the pattern of Pompeu Fabra standards who standardized the [[Catalan_language|Catalan]] language in Catalonia. The [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|IEC]] (Institute of Catalan Studies) standards are almost the same as the AVL (Valencian Language Academy) standards.

{{for|the magazine|Armchair General (magazine)}}

The term "'''armchair general'''" has two meanings. It is conventionally used as a derogatory term for a person who regards himself as an expert on military matters, despite having little to no actual experience in the military. Alternatively, it can mean a military commander who doesn't participate in actual combat.

== Conventional usage ==
The most common usage of the term refers to "[a] person without military experience who regards himself as an expert military strategist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/armchair_general|title=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This person may be a civilian whose only exposure to the military or [[military history]] is through academic or self-study, or a former member of the military, who was of low rank and/or has no experience with planning or strategic decision-making.  In both cases, these individuals claim to be more capable of analyzing combat conditions and making strategic judgments than past military commanders who have been responsible for such analysis and decisions (''see also'' [[Armchair theorizing]]'').

=== Examples of usage ===
In 1967, ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Max Frankel]] wrote, "In most wars, the armchairs are full of generals re-fighting every battle."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Alternate usage ==
The term is also used to describe "a military commander who is not actively involved in warfare, or who directs troops from a position of comfort or safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/armchair_general|title=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These officers' duties are described by the media and the rest of the military as more bureaucratic than functional, and who have little to no experience in combat or [[warfare]], yet hold a great degree of authority over soldiers or commanders who do.

The term is not exclusively applied to officers of command rank (such as [[General (military)|general]]s or [[Admiral]]s); it is also a popular term among enlisted personnel and the media to describe high-ranking officers whose rank affords them superior privileges, especially when they have attained rank through higher education, or the influence of their families, rather than combat duty.

=== Origin ===
*[[Carl von Clausewitz]] alluded to "someone following operations from an armchair".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Examples ===
* Many of the generals of [[World War I]] had experience in combat, but only from the days before [[trench warfare]] became widespread. Because of this, officers lacked the experience that in the past had made it viable to command troops from a distance.
*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], after enlisting in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1911, was assigned to the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and graduated in 1928. He never served in combat, even during World War I, and held mostly administrative positions afterwards. During [[World War II]], he was appointed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force]], in spite of never having been in combat.
*[[George Marshall]] was described as the "organizer of victory" by [[Winston Churchill]], for his outstanding logistical and administrative skills. Like Eisenhower, he rose to general's rank despite having never led troops in combat.
*The United States' [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are often regarded by the media as tedious bureaucrats, since their duties are largely administrative and political; those of them who have actually served in combat may have done so years, or decades, before attaining their high rank, and so this experience is seen as of little relevance.

'''Aboriginal avoidance practices''' refers to those relationships in traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] society where certain people are required to avoid others in their family or clan. These customs are still active in many parts of [[Australia]], to a greater or lesser extent.

Avoidance relationships are a mark of respect. There are also strong protocols around avoiding, or averting, eye contact, as well as around speaking the name of the dead.

==Avoidance of members==

In general, across most language groups, the two most common avoidance relationships are:

===Son/daughter-in-law and mother-in-law===
In what is the strongest kinship avoidance rule, some Australian Aboriginal customs ban a person from talking directly to their mother in law or even seeing her. A mother-in-law also eats apart from her son-in-law or daughter-in-law and their spouse. If the two are present at the same ceremony, they will sit with their backs to each other but they can still communicate via the wife/husband, who remains the main conduit for communication in this relationship. Often there are [[Avoidance speech|language customs]] surrounding these relationships.&lt;ref name="AIJA"&gt;[http://www.aija.org.au/online/ICABenchbook/BenchbookChapter2.pdf Aspects of Traditional Aboriginal Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412224125/http://www.aija.org.au/online/ICABenchbook/BenchbookChapter2.pdf |date=12 April 2013 }} AIJA Aboriginal Cultural Awareness Benchbook for Western Australian Courts&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship extends to avoiding all women of the same [[skin group]] as the mother-in-law, and, for the mother-in-law, men of the same skin group as the son-in-law. The age of marriage is very different for men and women with girls usually marrying at puberty while a man may not marry until his late 20s or even later. As mothers-in-law and sons-in-law are likely to be of approximately the same age the avoidance practice possibly serves to circumvent potential illicit relationships.&lt;ref name="AIJA" /&gt; It has also been suggested that the custom developed to overcome a common cause of friction in families.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | date = | title = Social Organisation| work = aboriginalculture.com| url = http://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/socialorganisation.shtml| accessdate = 11 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100322233231/http://www.aboriginalculture.com.au/socialorganisation.shtml| archivedate = 22 March 2010| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brother–sister===
This usually takes place after initiation. Prior to this, brothers and sisters play together freely.

Both these avoidance relationships have their grounding in the [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]] system, and so are ways of avoiding [[incest]] in small bands of closely related people.

There are many other avoidance relationships, including same-sex relationships, but these are the main two.

===Sexual relationships===
Once children are older, they are viewed as potential marital partners and their sexual behavior becomes one of strict avoidance until married. Permanent relationships are prescribed by traditional law and often arranged before birth.

Same-sex relationships are viewed in the same light as incest or "wrong" marriages (i.e., to a partner of their own choice or wrong skin group) which carry the same penalties as a domestic crime against the community. However, intimate bodily contact between women regardless of marital status is not considered sexually suggestive but affirmation of friendship and a "right to touch". Touch is particularly important when women tell jokes or discuss matters of a sexual nature. In these circumstances behavior such as "nipple tweaking" and "groin grabbing" are seen as signs of friendship.&lt;ref name="AIJA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Transgressive sex: subversion and control in erotic encounters", ''Fertility, Reproduction and Sexuality'', Vol. 13, [[Berghahn Books]], 2009. pp. 214–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoidance of naming the dead==
{{Main|Avoidance language}}
Traditionally, this meant avoiding referring to a deceased individual by name directly after their death as a mark of respect&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119415040/HTMLSTART "Australian findings on Aboriginal cultural practices associated with clothing, hair, possessions and use of name of deceased persons"], Pam McGrath and Emma Phillips, Research paper, ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 14, Issue #1, pp. 57–66&lt;/ref&gt;—and also because it is considered too painful for the grieving family. Today the practice continues in many communities, but has also come to encompass avoiding the publication or dissemination of photography or film footage of the deceased as well. Many Australian television programs and films include a title card warning Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] that "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewers are advised that the following program may contain images and voices of people who have died." (as recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Network&lt;ref name="Australian Broadcasting Corporation"&gt;[https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/abc-indigenous-content/ "ABC Indigenous Content"]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as, "that old lady", or by their generic [[skin name]], but not by first name.&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt; In some Central Australian communities, if for example, an individual named Alice dies, that name must be avoided in all contexts. This can even include the township [[Alice Springs]] being referred to in conversation in a roundabout way (which is usually fine, as the Indigenous name can be defaulted to). Those of the same name as the deceased are referred to by a substitute name during the avoidance period such as ''Kuminjay'', used in the Pintubi-Luritja dialect,&lt;ref&gt; Pintupi Luritja, a Western Desert language, http://www.clc.org.au/articles/info/aboriginal-languages/ &lt;/ref&gt;  or ''Galyardu'', which appears in a mid-western Australia [[Wajarri]] dictionary for this purpose. 

This presents some challenges to indigenous people. In traditional society, people lived together in small bands of extended family, and name duplication was less common. Today, as people have moved into larger communities (with upwards of 300 to 600 people), the logistics of name avoidance have become increasingly difficult. Exotic and rare names have therefore become very common, particularly in Central Australia and desert communities, to deal with this new challenge.

'''Beacon College,''' a private nonprofit college founded in 1989 in [[Leesburg, Florida]], is the first accredited institution of higher learning designed with curriculum and support services to serve those students with [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD]], or other [[Learning disability|specific learning disabilities]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Beacon College offers [[Associate of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in [[Human services|Human Services]], [[Interdisciplinary Studies]], [[Computer Information Systems]], [[Psychology]], and [[Business Management]]. It is regionally accredited through the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and is licensed by the [[Florida Department of Education]].

George J. Hagerty has served as president since March 2013.

== History ==
Led by learning-disabilities advocates Dr. Marsha Glines, and Patricia and Peter Latham, a group of parents incorporated Beacon College on May 24, 1989. At the time, the [[Florida Department of Education]] approved the college's plan to introduce a focused undergraduate curriculum aligned specifically to the specialized learning and support needs of students who learn differently. Beacon awards both Associate of Arts (A.A.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Beacon College Foundational Documents, Governance and Administration, Volume 1, June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Beacon College earned full accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Accreditation, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), June, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reaffirmed for the full 10-year period in 2008, and again in 2017.

Call Capture technology is both a phone and text-based technology that captures personal data from persons who inquire for information on something; usually a property for sale or rent. After the call is placed, the system notifies a client of the name and phone number of the person calling. The system was designed to generate leads specifically for the real estate industry.

==Sample service==
Real estate agents for example might display their call capture phone number on a sign rider (usually a 24X6 rider on top of a "For Sale" yard sign), with a call to action like "Info 24-7." There is usually a property identification number (usually 2-6 digits) along with the local or toll free phone number that can be called (or texted) for information.  Information about a property is delivered audibly via a phone call, or provided by text link.   

The assigned real estate agent receives a lead by email or text that a client is listening to a property presentation, or that a response text link has been sent on a particular property.  The lead usually includes the caller ID of the inbound phone number, the name of the party associated to the incoming phone number and the property that was just inquired-on.  Some call capture systems allow Multiple agents to be called simultaneously with the first responding agent getting the call/lead.

==Levels of service==

Basic Call Capture service is generally NOT integrated with MLS (Multiple Listing Service) and requires the recording of each property presentation

MLS-integrated Call Capture service operates on all listings in an MLS database and use street numbers (vs property codes) for indexing all properties.  These systems require automated voicing to keep audio presentations updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1835">The '''card paradox''' is a variant of the [[liar paradox]] constructed by [[Philip Jourdain]].&lt;ref name="OConnorRobertson2005"/&gt; It is also known as the '''postcard paradox''', '''Jourdain paradox''' or '''Jourdain's paradox'''.

== The paradox ==
Suppose there is a card with statements printed on both sides:

{|class="wikitable"
|'''Front:'''||The sentence on the other side of this card is TRUE.
|-
|'''Back:'''||The sentence on the other side of this card is FALSE.
|}

Trying to assign a truth value to either of them leads to a [[paradox]].

# If the first statement is true, then so is the second. But if the second statement is true, then the first statement is false. It follows that if the first statement is true, then the first statement is false.
# If the first statement is false, then the second is false, too. But if the second statement is false, then the first statement is true. It follows that if the first statement is false, then the first statement is true.

The same mechanism applies to the second statement. Neither of the sentences employs (direct) [[self-reference]], instead this is a case of [[circular reference]]. [[Yablo's paradox]] is a variation of the liar paradox that is intended to not even rely on circular reference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5503">A '''cardiac shunt''' is a pattern of blood flow in the heart that deviates from the normal circuit of the [[circulatory system]]. It may be described as [[right-to-left shunt|right-left]], left-right or bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or [[pulmonary-to-systemic shunt|pulmonary-to-systemic]]. The direction may be controlled by [[left heart|left]] and/or [[right heart]] [[blood pressure|pressure]], a biological or [[artificial heart valve]] or both. The presence of a shunt may also affect left and/or right heart pressure either beneficially or detrimentally.

==Terminology==
[[File:Atrial septal defect-en.png|thumb|Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt]]
The left and right sides of the [[heart]] are named from a dorsal view, i.e., looking at the heart from the back or from the perspective of the person whose heart it is. There are four chambers in a heart: an atrium (upper) and a ventricle (lower) on both the left and right sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19612.htm | title =Heart chambers | vauthors = ((National Library of Medicine)),((National Institutes of Health)),Dugdale DC, Zieve D, Chen MA, Ogilvie I,((A.D.A.M. editorial team)) | publisher =nlm.nih.gov | date =June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s, blood from the body goes to the [[right side of the heart]] first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/craigs/How%20Your%20Heart%20Works.htm |title=How Your Heart Works |author2=''[[Montana State University]]'' |author=Carl Bianco |publisher=montana.edu |date=May 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516092450/http://www.montana.edu/craigs/How%20Your%20Heart%20Works.htm |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood enters the upper [[right atrium]], is pumped down to the [[right ventricle]] and from there to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/heart-blood-vessels/how-does-blood-flow-through-heart.aspx | title =How Does Blood Flow Through the Heart? | author =''[[Cleveland Clinic]]'' | publisher =clevelandclinic.org | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood going to the lungs is called the [[pulmonary circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/systems/pulmonary.html |title=Body Systems Pulmonary Circulation: It's All in the Lungs |author=''[[The Franklin Institute]]'' |publisher=fi.edu |date=May 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505075001/http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/systems/pulmonary.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the blood returns to the heart from the lungs via the pulmonary vein, it goes to the [[left side of the heart]], entering the upper [[left atrium]]. Blood is then pumped to the lower [[left ventricle]] and from there out of the heart to the body via the aorta. This is called the [[systemic circulation]]. A cardiac shunt is when blood follows a pattern that deviates from the systemic circulation, i.e., from the body to the right atrium, down to the right ventricle, to the lungs, from the lungs to the left atrium, down to the left ventricle and then out of the heart back to the systemic circulation.

A left-to-right shunt is when blood from the left side of the heart goes to the right side of the heart. This can occur either through a hole in the ventricular or atrial septum that divides the left and the right heart or through a hole in the walls of the arteries leaving the heart, called [[great vessels]]. Left-to-right shunts occur when the [[systolic blood pressure]] in the left heart is higher than the right heart, which is the normal condition in birds and mammals.

==Congenital shunts in humans==
The most common [[congenital heart defect]]s ('''CHD'''s) which cause shunting are [[atrial septal defect]]s ('''ASD'''), patent foramen ovale (PFO), [[ventricular septal defect]]s ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus|patent ductus arteriosi]] ('''PDA'''). In isolation, these defects may be [[asymptomatic]], or they may produce [[symptom]]s which can range from mild to severe, and which can either have an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] or a delayed onset. However, these shunts are often present in combination with other defects; in these cases, they may still be asymptomatic, mild or severe, acute or delayed, but they may also work to counteract the negative symptoms caused by another defect (as with [[d-Transposition of the great arteries]]).

==Acquired shunts in human==

===Biological===
Some acquired shunts are modifications of congenital ones: a [[balloon septostomy]] can enlarge a [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] (if performed on a [[newborn]]), PFO or ASD; or [[prostaglandin]] can be administered to a newborn to prevent the [[ductus arteriosus]] from closing. [[Biological tissue]]s may also be used to construct artificial passages.

===Mechanical===
Mechanical shunts such as the [[Blalock-Taussig shunt]] are used in some cases of CHD to control [[circulatory system|blood flow]] or blood pressure.

==Reptile==

The main concept is that an appropriate level of CTL will cause the body of an athlete to go through fitness adaptations. The time span over which it is measured ranges from weeks to months. The concept of CTL is often used in comparison to that of acute training load to plan or examine the results of a training program.

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''code''' is a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's [[spoken language]], but the term can also be used to refer to any [[narrative]] form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] in [[chess]]).

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[value (semiotics)|value]] when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.

[[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see [[Semiosis]]).

==Discussion==
To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] and [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the [[message]]s. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the [[denotation (semiotics)|denotational]] to the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotational]], the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] of the medium, the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]], e.g. [[academic]], [[literature|literary]], [[genre fiction]], etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a [[literal and figurative language|literal]] representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegorical]] interpretation [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Distinctions of [[Social class|class]] or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] or as a [[dialect]]) or written (i.e. in sentences or in [[Short message service|SMS]] format), the place of residence (see [[American English|Americanisms]]), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]s as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of [[socialisation]] is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an [[ideological]] quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[belief]]s. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.
The other code forms rely upon [[knowledge]] held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of [[vocabulary]] and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and [[ideological]] codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and a piece of [[bubblegum pop]], and a painting by [[Rembrandt]] and a [[comic book]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.
In communication research and [[Media studies|media research]], the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: 
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate design''' (CD) is the official graphical [[design]] of the [[logo]] and name of a [[company]] or institution used on [[letterhead]]s, envelopes, forms, folders, [[brochure]]s, etc. The [[Corporate identity|house style]] is created in such a way that all the elements are arranged in a distinctive design and pattern.

This includes dictating what ink [[pantone]]s should be used in the coloring, and what [[typeface]]s.

Governments may have corporate designs as well. On June 2, 1999, the German federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the flag of Germany.&lt;ref name="design-literatur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |title=Primärfarben |work=Corporate Design Documentation |author=Federal Government of Germany |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085300/http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'corporate design' is not the name of a specific design profession.

Corporations do have special design needs based on their behaviors. They communicate their mission, objectives, needs, and product information -- with users, clients, or members; with suppliers, distributors, service providers; with the surrounding community and the media; with financial institutions and other corporations, and with the state. They create, acquire, modify, organize and distribute large amounts of information and raw data, as well as goods and services. (Sometimes the goods or services are themselves information. For example, ''The Yellow Pages'', or ''The New York Times''.)

A designer whose client is a corporation will include the logo and other elements of the corporate brand as a way to standardize and unify all communication between company and audience, whether in print or online. Scenarios that includes human-computer interactions take place through software and hardware user interfaces that are also branded and designed with the [[corporate culture]] in mind. (Examples of user scenarios: update the Web site, transfer funds, document procedures, control security, operate machinery, plan projects, conduct virtual meetings, check inventory, fill an order, or ship a product.)

These interactions are increasingly taking place through Web sites, through mobile devices and at dedicated terminals, and may include sound, video, animation and user feedback mechanisms. A savvy designer will create designs that can be adapted to all of these applications.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

A '''crossclaim''' is a claim asserted between [[Defendant|codefendants]] or coplaintiffs in a case and that relates to the subject of the original claim or [[counterclaim]] according to ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''. A cross claim is filed against someone who is a co-defendant or co-plaintiff to the party who originates the crossclaim. In [[common law]], a crossclaim is a demand made in a [[pleading]] that is filed against a party which is on the "same side" of the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glannon|first1=Joseph W.|title=Glannon Guide to Civil Procedure|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9781454838227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. federal courts==
In the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] this is codified in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule13.htm Rule 13(g)].  In the federal rules, a crossclaim is proper if it relates to a matter of the original jurisdiction.  Proper jurisdiction is determined by a finding of whether the suit that is being initiated arises from the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the suit.

The policy for allowing crossclaims is that they promote efficiency and consistency.  Furthermore, the same underlying facts will be litigated on the main claim as well as on the crossclaim preserving efficiency in the judicial system by resolving multiple claims that might arise between the parties as opposed to courts trying each claim individually and re-litigating the same facts. Furthermore, this will prevent inconsistent verdicts that might harm the public perception of the judicial process.  Finally, because crossclaims are not mandatory, they allow the moving party the opportunity to sue later.  The plaintiff is the master of his complaint, and this also holds true in crossclaims.

[[File:Poster of Azerbaijan 1938. Constitutions.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet Poster featuring Stalin, [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]], 1938]] 

A '''cult of personality''' arises when a country's regime &amp;ndash; or, more rarely, an individual &amp;ndash; uses the techniques of [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], the [[big lie]], [[spectacle]], [[the arts]], [[patriotism]], and [[government-organized demonstration]]s and rallies to create an idealized, heroic, and worshipful image of a leader, often through unquestioning [[flattery]] and [[praise]].  A cult of personality is similar to [[apotheosis]], except that it is established by modern [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering techniques]], usually by the state or the party in [[one-party state]]s. It is often seen in [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] countries. 

The term came to prominence in 1956, in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s secret speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'', given on the final day of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].  In the speech, Khrushchev, who was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary of the Communist Party]] &amp;ndash; in effect, the leader of the country &amp;ndash; criticized the [[Stalin's cult of personality|lionization and idealization]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], and, by implication, his Communist contemporary [[Mao Zedong]], as being [[Revisionism (Marxism)|contrary]] to [[Marxism|Marxist doctrine]].  The speech was later made public and was part of the "[[de-Stalinization]]" process the Soviet Union went through.

==Background==
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Augustus of Prima Porta]], 1st century AD]]
{{See also|Imperial cult}}
The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified [[emperors]] and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority ([[auctoritas]]) of the [[Roman State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Imperial cult of ancient Rome|date=2018-08-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperial_cult_of_ancient_Rome&amp;oldid=854819458|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, [[monarch]]s and other [[Head of state|heads of state]] were often held in enormous reverence and imputed super-human qualities. Through the principle of the [[divine right of kings]], in medieval Europe for example, rulers were said to hold office by the will of [[God]]. [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Imperial Japan]], the [[Inca]], the [[Aztecs]], [[Tibet]], Siam (now [[Thailand]]), and the [[Roman Empire]] are especially noted for redefining monarchs as "god-kings".

The spread of democratic and secular ideas in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 18th and 19th centuries made it increasingly difficult for monarchs to preserve this aura. However, the subsequent development of [[mass media]], such as [[radio]], enabled political leaders to project a positive image of themselves onto the masses as never before. It was from these circumstances in the 20th century that the most notorious personality cults arose. Often these cults are a form of [[political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Plamper. The Stalin Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press. 2012. pp.13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cult of personality" probably appeared in English around 1800–1850, along with the French and German use.&lt;ref name="Heller2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Klaus|title=Personality Cults in Stalinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CreuLAI0c9sC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=7 September 2018|year=2004|publisher=Isd|isbn=978-3-89971-191-2|pages=23–33|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At first it had no political connotations but was instead closely related to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] "cult of genius".&lt;ref name="Heller2004"/&gt; The political use of the phrase came first in a letter from [[Karl Marx]] to German political worker, Wilhelm Blos, 10 November 1877:&lt;ref name="Heller2004"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
There are various views about what constitutes a cult of personality in a leader. Historian [[Jan Plamper]] has written that modern-day personality cults display five characteristics that set them apart from "their predecessors": The cults are secular and "anchored in popular sovereignty"; their objects are all males; they target the entire population, not only the well-to-do or just the ruling class; they use mass media; and they exist where the mass media can be controlled enough to inhibit the introduction of "rival cults".&lt;ref&gt;The Stain Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power. p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''What is character and why it really does matter'', Thomas A. Wright states, "The cult of personality phenomenon refers to the idealized, even god-like, public image of an individual consciously shaped and molded through constant propaganda and media exposure. As a result, one is able to manipulate others based entirely on the influence of public personality...the cult of personality perspective focuses on the often shallow, external images that many public figures cultivate to create an idealized and heroic image."&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"&gt;What is character and why it really does matter. p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Teodor Popan defines cult of personality as a "quantitatively exaggerated and qualitatively extravagant public demonstration of praise of the leader". He also identifies three causal "necessary, but not sufficient, structural conditions, and a path dependent chain of events which, together, lead to the cult formation: a particular combination of patrimonialism and clientelism, lack of dissidence, and systematic falsification pervading the society’s culture."&lt;ref&gt;See Adrian Teodor Popan, ''The ABC of Sycophancy. Structural Conditions for the Emergence of Dictators’ Cults of Personality'' (PhD dissertation U of Texas 2015). Bibliography pp 196-213.[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf  online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The ABC of sycophancy : structural conditions for the emergence of dictators' cults of personality |date=August 2015 |doi=10.15781/T2J960G15 |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en |id=|hdl=2152/46763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the media==
The media has played an instrumental role in forging national leaders' cults of personality.

Thomas A. Wright reports that "It is becoming evident that the charismatic leader, especially in politics, has increasingly become the product of media and self-exposure."&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"/&gt; And, focusing on the media in the United States, Robert N. Bellah adds that, "It is hard to determine the extent to which the media reflect the cult of personality in American politics and to what extent they have created it. Surely they did not create it all alone, but just as surely they have contributed to it. In any case, American politics is dominated by the personalities of political leaders to an extent rare in the modern world...in the personalised politics of recent years the "charisma" of the leader may be almost entirely a product of media exposure."&lt;ref&gt;California Law Review. p.747&lt;/ref&gt;

Enjoying repeated electoral success; particularly his third election victory in 2008, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], an Italian [[media proprietor|media tycoon]] and politician who served as Prime Minister of Italy in four governments, was the most controversial head of government in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial Politics, Populism and 'post-fascism' Carlo Ruzza, Stefano Fella, Political Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuzzaFella2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruzza|first1=Carlo|last2=Fella|first2=Stefano|title=Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial Politics, Populism and 'post-fascism'|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4cVgOb7fsNcC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=berlusconi+populism+media&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5ihaT7fOHKSt0QWqyoXmDQ&amp;redir_esc=y%23v=onepage&amp;q=berlusconi%20populism%20media&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2018|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34461-6|pages=227–|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the controlling shareholder of [[Mediaset]] and owned the [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club [[A.C.

==Purpose==
Often, a single leader became associated with this revolutionary transformation and came to be treated as a benevolent "guide" for the nation without whom the transformation to a better future could not occur. This has been generally the justification for personality cults that arose in totalitarian societies, such as those of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong]]. Jan Plamper argues while [[Napoleon III]] made some innovations it was  [[Benito Mussolini]] in  Italy in the 1920s who originated the model of dictator-as-cult-figure that was emulated  by Hitler, Stalin and the others, using the propaganda powers of a totalitarian state.&lt;ref&gt; Jan Plamper, ''The Stalin Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power'' (Yale UP, 2012), pp 4, 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre du Bois argues that the Stalin cult was elaborately constructed to legitimize his rule. Many deliberate distortions and falsehoods were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=du Bois |first1=Pierre |title=Stalin – Genesis of a Myth |journal=Survey.

Historian [[David L. Hoffmann]] states "The Stalin cult was a central element of [[Stalinism]], and as such it was one of the most salient features of Soviet rule...Many scholars of Stalinism cite the cult as integral to Stalin's power or as evidence of Stalin's megalomania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffmann |first1=David L. |title=The Stalin Cult |journal=The Historian |date=2013 |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=909 |accessdate=7 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The American band [[Living Colour]] won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 1990 for their song "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0hYpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=woQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6625,4056376&amp;dq ''Here's List of Nominees from all 77 Categories.''] [[The Deseret News]]. Salt Lake City, Utah. 12 January 1990. page W7. Accessed 8 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The song includes references to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Malcolm X]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">In [[sociolinguistics]], the '''curvilinear principle''' states that there is a tendency for linguistic [[change from below]] to originate from members of the central classes in a [[Speech community|speech community's]] socioeconomic hierarchy, rather than from the outermost or exterior classes.&lt;ref name=Labov2001&gt; Labov, William. Principles of Linguistic Change, vol iii: Social Factors. Malden and Oxford: Blackwell. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
[[File:The_Curvilinear_Principle,_Frequency_of_variable_use_according_to_social_class.jpg|thumb|right|Graph demonstrating the curvilinear principle, showing that the frequency of use is highest in the interior classes and lowest in the exterior classes.]]
Defined by [[William Labov]], the curvilinear principle departs from traditional nineteenth century notions that language change generally originates in the highest or lowest classes of society. Instead, it states that variant forms leading to language change are typically introduced and motivated by the intermediate groups—the upper-working class and lower-middle class.&lt;ref name=Labov2001 /&gt;

The principle can be seen as one response to an important question in sociolinguistics known as the ''embedding problem'', a problem "concerned with determining regular patterns in both the linguistic and the extra-linguistic context of change."&lt;ref name=Milroy1985&gt;Milroy, James and Lesley Milroy. "Linguistic Change, Social Network and Speaker Innovation". ''Journal of Linguistics''. 21.2: Sep., 1954. 339-384.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the embedding problem seeks to identify other changes or factors that have a non-coincidental relationship with the actual linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Weinreich1968&gt;Weinreich, U., W. Labov and M. Herzog. 1968. "Empirical foundations for a theory of language change". In W. Lehmann and Y. Malkiel (eds.) Directions for Historical Linguistics. Austin: University of Texas Press. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The curvilinear principle identifies such a non-trivial factor by proposing that a speaker’s class can indicate the degree to which he or she motivates linguistic change.

The principle's name refers to the [[Curve|curvilinear]] correlation that results from plotting the variation of a linguistic variable with respect to the class of the speakers. Because the lowest and highest classes generally tend to use newly emerging forms less frequently than central classes, data points representing variable usage resemble a [[Concave function|concave]] curve when connected on a graph.

==Studies==

===The Philadelphia Study===
In [[The Philadelphia study]], William Labov examined a series of linguistic variables in various stages of speech integration in order to evaluate whether the interior classes were, in fact, the innovators of linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Labov2001 /&gt; In order to determine each speaker’s social position within the community, Labov created a socioeconomic status index based on education and occupation, each ranked on levels from 0 to 6, where 6 was the highest level of education or occupation. He studied a series of “new and vigorous” vowel changes, including the fronting and raising of (aw) and (ey) and the centralization of (ay).&lt;ref name=Labov1984&gt; Labov, William. 1984
“Field methods of the Project on Linguistic Change and Variation.” Language in Use. 43-70. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall. 1984. &lt;/ref&gt; The research found that members of the upper working class and lower middle class used these variables more frequently than members of either the lower or upper class. This corroborated his curvilinear hypothesis because the middle classes were leading the use of these "new and vigorous" linguistic changes.&lt;ref name=Labov2001/&gt;

===Norwich===
In his study of [[Norwich, England]], Peter Trudgill examined different cases of linguistic variation and whether or not class could be related to realizations of certain linguistic variables. One of the observed variables was the [[Received Pronunciation|(RP)]] quality of vowels in words like ''top'', ''hot'', and ''dog''.&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh2006&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. An Introduction to Sociolinguistics. Malden, Massachusetts:Blackwell Publishing, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine a subject’s class, Trudgill calculated a score for each subject based on six parameters: subject’s occupation, father’s occupation, income, education, locality, and housing.&lt;ref name=Ash2002 &gt;Ash, Sharon. "Social Class."" ''The Handbook of Language Variation and Change,'' 402-422. Malden, Mass: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill found that middle-class women were introducing the RP vowels in Norwich; working-class men were also introducing variation by borrowing a similar vowel associated with working-class speech from a nearby area.&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh2006 /&gt; The distribution of linguistic variation in Trudgill’s study thus abides by the curvilinear principle because members of the central classes led the change.

===Lower East Side===
In 1966, Labov published a study on linguistic variation on the [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Labov1966 &gt;Labov, William. The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the study, he approximated each subject’s class with score that factored in his or her occupation, income, and education.&lt;ref name=Ash2002 /&gt; Using these scores, Labov then grouped the subjects into 5 categories defined by sociologist Joseph Kahl: lower class, working class, lower middle class, upper middle class, and upper class (though Labov noted no subjects were considered upper class and that the presence of any upper-class people living on the Lower East Side would be unexpected).&lt;ref name=Labov1966 /&gt;

One variable considered was (oh), the mid-back rounded vowel present in ''caught'', ''talk'', and ''dog''. Labov found that members of the working class and lower middle class—the central socioeconomic classes of the Lower East Side—used higher vowels for (oh) than did either the lower class or the middle class subjects. Labov recognized this as a linguistic change in progress, driven by the central class in accordance with the curvilinear principle.&lt;ref name=Labov1966 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Cut to shape''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term referring to a [[postage stamp]] or [[postal stationery]] [[Indicia (philately)|indicium]] (printed stamp image) that has been cut to the shape of the design, such as an octagon, circle or oval, instead of simply cut into a [[cut square|square or rectangular shape]].&lt;ref name=linns&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary Of Philatelic Terms | publisher = [[Linn's Stamp News]] | url = http://www.linns.com/reference/terms/terms.asp?firstletter=c | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stamps cut to shape almost always command a lower price than those [[cut square]], and sometimes have little or no value, especially envelope indicia cut to shape.  Although many stamps unfortunately have been cut to shape by stamp collectors, some early stamps were produced without perforations and were often cut to shape by people before they affixed the stamps to their envelopes. This is true, for example, for the octagon-shaped 4 Annas stamp of India issued in 1854, which is most commonly found cut to shape on envelopes or pieces.  

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Four annas H3 F2 smaller.jpg|India 1854, cut square
Image:Inverted_Head_Four_Annas.jpg|[[Inverted Head 4 Annas|India 1854 (inverted head)]], cut to shape
&lt;/gallery&gt;

All of the surviving examples of the India 1854 (inverted head) are postally used. Only two (or three) are known cut square; another 24 or so are cut to shape (that is, in an octagonal shape).  One from the collection of the Earl of Crawford was exhibited in the World Philatelic Exhibition in Washington in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060207055505/http://www.washington-2006.org/wrarities.htm#indiaqueen#indiaqueen India's 1854 Blue and Pale Red Inverted Head]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "world's most famous stamp" — the unique 1856 [[British Guiana 1c magenta]] — is cut into an octagonal shape. Consequently, it has been referred to as being cut to shape,&lt;ref name=linns/&gt; although technically that term is incorrect as the stamp design is rectangular in shape.

A '''display window''', also '''shop window''' ([[British English]]) or '''store window''' ([[American English]]), is a [[window]] in a [[retailer|shop]] displaying items for sale or otherwise designed to attract [[customer]]s to the store. Usually, the term refers to larger windows in the front [[façade]] of the shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/story/2011-12-02/window-displays/51643926/1 Holiday window displays can help lure shoppers, study says]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first display windows in shops were installed in the late 18th century in [[London]], where levels of [[consumer revolution|conspicuous consumption]] were growing rapidly. Retailer [[Francis Place]] was one of the first to experiment with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in [[Charing Cross]], where he fitted the shop-front with large [[Flat glass|plate glass]] windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he "sold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&amp;dq=Robertson%27s+Book+of+Firsts:+Who+Did+What+For+the+First+Time&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C1QjUpCfHbCg7AaoqIDoDA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA|title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time|author=Patrick Robertson

Display windows at [[boutique]]s usually have dressed-up [[mannequin]]s in them.

==Window dressing==
Displaying [[merchandise]] in a store window is known as "[[window dresser|window dressing]]", which is also used to describe the items displayed themselves. 

As a [[figure of speech]], "window dressing" means something done to make a better impression, and sometimes implies something dishonest or [[deceptive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|author=Pearsall, Judy|title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sport|sports]], a '''division''' is a group of teams who compete against each other for a championship.

==League system==
In sports using a [[league system]] (also known as a pyramid structure), a division consists of a group of teams who play a sport at a similar competitive level. Teams can move up to a higher division of play or drop down to a lower one via the process of [[promotion and relegation]], based on their performance in the standings at the end of the season. The existence of divisions based on level of competition ensures that teams at one competitive level can play other teams at a similar competitive level, thus creating [[parity (sports)|parity]] and more exciting matches.

==Franchise system==
In [[North America]], where sports usually operate on a [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system)|franchise system]] rather than a league system, a division is a group of teams within a [[sports league|league]] which is organized along geographical lines rather than competitive success. Teams based in cities that are in a particular region of the continent are grouped together in the same division. For instance, in [[Major League Baseball]], both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s have East, Central, and West divisions; the teams in each division are mostly (but not always) located in the eastern, central, and western sections of North America respectively. In a franchise system, teams are not promoted or relegated as are teams in a league system. All teams in the league (and by extension, the divisions of the league) are at the same competitive level and remain so year after year.

North American professional sports leagues often construct their season schedules in a way such that teams in a division play matches against each other more often than other teams in the league. This not only has the effect of reducing travel costs, but also creates exciting [[list of sports rivalries|rivalries]] between the teams in the division. Moreover, the top teams in a division qualify for the postseason [[playoffs|playoff]] tournament that crowns the league champion, which heightens the rivalries between the teams in a division.

Geographically-based divisions can become skewed if an [[expansion team]] joins the league or if one of the franchises within a division moves to another city, necessitating a shuffling or [[realignment (sports)|realignment]] of the teams in a division. Furthermore, the results of the realignment may not always reflect geographical realities. For instance, in 1995, the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) moved to [[St Louis, Missouri]] and became the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St Louis Rams]]. The team retained its place in the [[NFC West]] division despite the fact that St. Louis is further east than [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], home of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Although Dallas is located in the south-central United States, the Cowboys are a member of the [[NFC East]] division due to their long-standing rivalries with the [[New York Giants]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and [[Washington Redskins]], all of whom are located on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]].

==U.S. college sports==
In [[college athletics|U.S. college sports]], a "division" has a meaning different from either sense listed above, although somewhat closer to that of the league system.

The major governing bodies for college sports, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], divide their member schools into large competitive groups. These groups are much larger than divisions in either the league or franchise system—for example, the NCAA's highest competitive level, [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], has more than 300 member schools. The vast majority of teams are members of [[List of college athletic conferences|conferences]], smaller groupings that usually have between 6 and 14 members. Conference champions, plus selected other teams, compete in national championship tournaments (with the exception of schools in [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|the highest level]] of NCAA [[college football|(American) football]], which have [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|never had an NCAA-recognized national championship]]).

As an example, the NCAA is split into three divisions:

* Division I – Usually the largest and most prominent schools, with the largest athletic budgets. All Division I member schools are allowed to award [[athletic scholarship]]s to students, although some schools and conferences voluntarily choose not to award athletic scholarships in some or all sports (most notably the [[Ivy League]], which prohibits such scholarships in all sports).
* [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] – Generally smaller schools that do not choose to take on the sometimes-massive expense of Division I athletics. The NCAA allows D-II schools to award scholarships, but places much more stringent limits on the amount of athletic aid awarded than at the D-I level.
* [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] – Schools, usually but not always small institutions, at which intercollegiate sports is treated more as a regular student activity. In keeping with this philosophy, the NCAA prohibits Division III schools from awarding athletic scholarships.

==="Division" within conferences===
The term ''division'' is also used in US college sports to indicate the groupings of members of a given [[List of college athletic conferences|conference]]. However, this usage is more recent. The first conference to divide its teams into divisions was the Southeastern Conference which, upon expanding to 12 members in 1992, divided into Eastern and Western divisions. Other conferences have undergone similar expansion and division. The usage in the section above is still maintained. For example, the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] are in Division I, but are also in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17999">The '''dual-route theory of reading aloud''' was first described in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, are involved in [[Reading (process)|reading]] aloud, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One mechanism, termed the '''lexical route''', is the process whereby skilled readers can recognize known words by sight alone, through a "dictionary" lookup procedure.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zorzi|first1=Marco|last2=Houghton|first2=George|last3=Butterworth|first3=Brian|title=Two routes or one in reading aloud?

Modeling reading : the dual-route approach | editors = Margaret J Snowling; Charles Hulme | work = The science of reading : a handbook | publisher = Blackwell Pub., | year = 2005 | location = Malden, MA | pages = 6–23 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/PDF/Coltheart%2005.pdf | oclc = 57579252 | isbn = 9781405114882}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal lexicon encompasses every learned word, even exception words like 'colonel' or 'pint' that don't follow letter-to-sound rules. This route doesn't enable reading of [[pseudoword|nonwords]] (example 'zuce').&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;  There is still no conclusive evidence whether the lexical route functions as a direct pathway going from visual word recognition straight to [[speech production]], or a less direct pathway going from visual word recognition to [[semantics|semantic]] processing and finally to speech production.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;

The '''nonlexical''' or '''sublexical route''', on the other hand, is the process whereby the reader can "sound out" a written word. This is done by identifying the word's constituent parts (letters, [[phonemes]], [[graphemes]]) and, applying knowledge of how these parts are associated with each other, for example how a string of neighboring letters sound together.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;  This mechanism can be thought of as a letter-sound rule system that allows the reader to actively build a phonological representation and read the word aloud.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990" /&gt;  The nonlexical route allows the correct reading of nonwords as well as regular words that follow spelling-sound rules, but not exception words.
The dual-route hypothesis of reading has helped researchers explain and understand various facts about normal and abnormal reading.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=behrmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrmann|first=M.|author2=Bub, D.|title=Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia: dual routes, single lexicon|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1992|volume=9|issue=3|pages=209–251|doi=10.1080/02643299208252059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dual route hypothesis to reading.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The mechanisms involved in dual-route processing, moving from the recognition of a written word to speech production.]]

==Transparency of phonological rules==
According to research, the amount of time required to master reading depends on the language's adherence to phonological rules.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprenger-Charolles|first=Liliane|author2=[[Linda Siegel|Siegel, Linda S.]] |author3=Jiménez, Juan E. |author4= Ziegler, Johannes C. |title=Prevalence and Reliability of Phonological, Surface, and Mixed Profiles in Dyslexia: A Review of Studies Conducted in Languages Varying in Orthographic Depth|journal=Scientific Studies of Reading|year= 2011|volume=15|issue=6|pages=498–521| doi=10.1080/10888438.2010.524463| url=http://lpp.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/pdf/2762.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[orthography|written language]] is described as transparent when it strongly adheres to spelling-sound rules and contains few exception words. Because of this, the English language (low transparency) is considered less transparent that French (medium transparency) and Spanish (high transparency) which contain more consistent grapheme-phoneme mappings. This difference explains why it takes more time for children to learn to read English, due to its frequent irregular orthography, compared to French and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;  The Spanish language's reliance on phonological rules can account for the fact that Spanish-speaking children exhibit a higher level of performance in nonword reading, compared to English and French-speaking children. Similarly, Spanish surface dyslexics exhibit less impairment in reading overall, because they can rely upon consistent pronunciation rules instead of processing many exception words as a whole in the internal lexicon.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;  The dual-route system thus provides an explanation for the differences in reading acquisition rates as well as dyslexia rates between different languages.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;

==Reading speed==

Skilled readers demonstrate longer reaction times when reading aloud irregular words that do not follow spelling-sound rules compared to regular words.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  When an irregular word is presented, both the lexical and nonlexical pathways are activated but they generate conflicting information that takes time to be resolved. The decision-making process that appears to take place indicates that the two routes are not entirely independent from one another.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  This data further explains why regular words, that follow spelling-sound rules but also have been stored in long-term memory, are read faster since both pathways can "agree" about the issue of pronunciation.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;

==Attentional demands of each route==
According to the current model of dual-route processing, each of the two pathways consumes different amounts of limited attentional resources.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  The nonlexical pathway is thought to be more active and constructive as it assembles and selects the correct subword units from various potential combinations. For example, when reading the word "leaf", that adheres to spelling to sound rules, the reader must assemble and recognize the two-letter grapheme "ea" in order to produce the sound "ee" that corresponds to it.  It engages in controlled processing and thus requires more attentional capacities, which can vary in amount depending on the complexity of the words being assembled.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  On the other hand, the processing that takes place in the lexical pathway appears to be more automatic, since the word-sound units in it are pre-assembled. Lexical processing is thus considered to be more passive, consuming less attentional resources.&lt;ref name=paap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paap|first=Kenneth R.|author2=Noel, Ronald W.|title=Dual-route models of print to sound: Still a good horse race|journal=Psychological Research|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=13–24|doi=10.1007/BF00867328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading disorders==

The dual-route hypothesis to reading can help explain patterns of data connected to certain types of [[Reading for special needs|disordered reading]], both [[dyslexia|developmental]] and [[Alexia (condition)|acquired]].&lt;ref name="Traxler 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Traxler |title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-9862-1 |oclc=707263897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dyslexia chart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Routes impaired in surface and phonological dyslexia]]

Children with reading disorders rely primarily on the sub-lexical route while reading.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jong CG, Licht R, Sergeant JA, Oosterlaan J |title=RD, ADHD, and their comorbidity from a dual route perspective |journal=Child Neuropsychol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=467–86 |year=2012 |pmid=21999484 |doi=10.1080/09297049.2011.625354 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that children can decode non-words, letter by letter, accurately but with slow speed. However, in decision tasks, they have trouble differentiating between words and pseudohomophones (non words that sound like real words but are incorrectly spelled), thereby showing that they had impaired internal lexicons.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;
Because children with reading disorders (RD) have both slow reading speeds and impaired lexical routes, there are suggestions that the same processes are involved in lexical route and fast naming of words.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;  Other studies have also confirmed this idea that rapid naming of words is more strongly correlated with orthographical knowledge (lexical route) than with phonological representations (sub-lexical route). Similar results were observed for patients with [[ADHD]].&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;
Research concludes that reading disorders and ADHD have common properties: lexical route processing, rapid reading and sublexical route processing deficits as well.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;

===Acquired surface dyslexia===

Surface dyslexia was first described by Marshall and Newcombe, and is characterized by the inability to read words that do not follow traditional pronunciation rules. English is also an example of a language that has numerous exceptions to the rules of pronunciation and thus presents a particular challenge to those with surface dyslexia. Patients with surface dyslexia may fail to read such words as yacht, or island for example, because they do not follow prescribed rules of pronunciation. The words will typically be sounded out using “regularizations”, such as pronouncing colonel as Kollonel.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; Words like state, and abdominal, are examples of words that surface dyslexia sufferers will not have a problem pronouncing, as they do follow proscribed pronunciation rules. &lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; Surface dyslexics will read some irregular words correctly if they are high frequency words such as “have” and "some”.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that surface dyslexics are able to read regular words by retrieving the pronunciation through semantic means. Or in other words, retrieving the words by meaning.&lt;ref&gt;oslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; 

Surface dyslexia is also semantically mediated. Meaning that there is a relationship between the word and its meaning and not just the mechanisms in how it is pronounced. People who suffer with surface dyslexia also have the ability to read words and non-words alike. This means the physical production of phonological sounds is not affected by surface dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mechanism behind surface dyslexia is thought to be involved with the phonologic output of the lexicon and is also often attributed to the disruption of semantics. It is also hypothesized that three deficits cause surface dyslexia. The first deficit is at the visual level in recognizing and processing the irregular word. The second deficit may be located at the level of the output lexicon. This is because patients are able to recognize the semantic meaning of irregular words even if they pronounce them incorrectly in spoken word. This suggests the visual word form system and semantics are relatively preserved. The third deficit is likely related to semantic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt;

While Surface dyslexia can be observed in patients with lesions in their temporal lobe, it is primarily associated with patients who have dementias. Such as Alzheimer’s or fronto-temporal dementia. Surface dyslexia is also a characteristic of semantic dementia, in which subjects lose knowledge of the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of surface dyslexics involves neuropsychological rehabilitation. The aim of the treatment is to improve the operation of the sub lexical reading route, or the patient’s ability to sound out new words. As well as the operation of the visual word recognition system, to increase the recognition of words. On a more micro level, treatment can also focus on the ability to sound out individual letters before the patient goes on to increasing the ability to sound out entire words.&lt;ref&gt;Brunsdon, &amp; Coltheart. (2005). Assessment and Treatment of Reading Disorders: A Cognitive Neuropsychological Perspective. Lecture presented in Macquarie University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired phonological dyslexia===
Acquired phonological dyslexia is a type of dyslexia that results in an inability to read nonwords aloud and to identify the sounds of single letters. However, patients with this disability can holistically read and correctly pronounce words, regardless of length, meaning, or how common they are, as long as they are stored in memory.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;  This type of dyslexia is thought to be caused by damage in the nonlexical route, while the lexical route, that allows reading familiar words, remains intact.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;

==Computational modeling of the dual-route process==

A [[computational model]] of a cognitive task is essentially a computer program that aims to mimic human cognitive processing&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Rastle, Kathleen |author3=Perry, Conrad |author4=Langdon, Robyn |author5= Ziegler, Johannes |title=DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 2001| volume=108|issue=1| pages=204–256| doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 |pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of model helps bring out the precise parts of a theory and disregards the ambiguous sections, as only the clearly understood parts of the theory can be converted into a computer program. The ultimate goal of a computational model is to resemble human behavior as closely as possible, such that factors affecting the functioning of the program would similarly affect human behavior and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;
Reading is an area that has been extensively studied via the computational model system. The dual-route cascaded model (DRC) was developed to understand the dual-route to reading in humans.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;
Some commonalities between human reading and the DRC model are:&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;

* Frequently occurring words are read aloud faster than non-frequently occurring words.
* Actual words are read faster than non-words.
* Standard sounding words are read aloud faster than irregular sounding words.

The DRC model has been useful as it was also made to mimic dyslexia. Surface dyslexia was imitated by damaging the orthographic lexicon so that the program made more errors on irregular words than on regular or non-words, just as is observed in surface dyslexia.&lt;ref name=behrmann /&gt;  Phonological dyslexia was similarly modeled by selectively damaging the non-lexical route thereby causing the program to mispronounce non words. As with any model, the DRC model has some limitations and a newer version is currently being developed.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses a [[breve]], {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;̆&amp;nbsp;]}}, to indicate a speech sound (usually a [[vowel]]) with '''less than normal''' or '''extra short''' duration. That is, {{IPA|[ă]}} is a very short vowel with the quality of {{IPA|[a]}}.

An example from English is the short [[schwa]] of the word ''police'' {{IPA|[pʰə̆ˈliˑs]}}. This is typical of [[vowel reduction]].

Before 1989, the breve was used for a [[Semi-vowel|non-syllabic vowel]] (that is, part of a [[diphthong]]), which is now indicated by an {{em|inverted}} breve placed under the vowel letter, as in ''eye'' {{IPA|[aɪ̯]}}. It is also sometimes used for [[flap consonant]]s which do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA, since a flap is in effect a very brief [[stop consonant|stop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">A '''flow show''' is a device on a [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] that is attached to the [[flow line]] and has a paddle that swings out as the flow of [[drilling fluid]] passes by it. The angle of the paddle increases as the volume of drilling fluid increases and pushes it out further and vice versa.

The purpose of the flow show is to allow the driller (and other rig personnel) to monitor the flow of drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole. The reason for monitoring the flow:

*If a high pressure zone is drilled and overcomes the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the fluid or gas in the high-pressure zone will begin to enter the [[borehole]] and increase the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before the flow becomes critical.
*If a low pressure zone is drilled and is overcome by the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the low pressure zone may begin to ''take'' fluid and decrease the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before losing too much drilling fluid (which is typically very expensive) down the hole and/or losing so much fluid that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the (decreasing) column of mud becomes so low that a blowout situation becomes imminent.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34751">'''German Luftwaffe and Navy Kriegsmarine Radar Equipment''' during World War II, relied on an increasingly diverse array of communications, IFF and RDF equipment for its function.  Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG ({{lang-de|Funkgerät}}), meaning "radio equipment". During the war,  Germany renumbered their radars. From using the year of introduction as their number they moved to a different numbering scheme.

==Search Light and Fighter Control==

No German ground radar was accurate enough for Flak fire direction. The operation method for Flak during the day was to use the radar to be used to set the optical fire control for the flak onto the target. Once acquired the flak was controlled by the optical equipment to complete the engagement. During the night the Radar would be used to indicate the target to the search light crews. The rest of the engagement would be carried out optically. During the day fighters would be directed with sufficient precision that they would be able to see their targets and during The night they would use their onboard AI radar to find the target after initial direction from the ground-based radars.

===Würzburg===
[[File: Würzburg-Riese at Gatow.JPG|thumb|''Würzburg-Riese'' radar]]
The Würzburg was first operational in the summer of 1940, had a parabolic shaped antenna with a diameter of about 3metres and in some models could be folded in half for transport. The Würzburg was produced in the thousands with various estimated figures being between 3000 and 4000 with up to 1500 sets of Würzburg Riese. The antenna of the Würzburg weighed over 9.5 tons and its parabolic surface had a diameter equal to 7.5 metres and a focal length of one metres and 70&amp;nbsp;cm. Only one German company had the technical skill to build these radars, and that was 
[[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin]].&lt;ref name="Galati2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galati|first=Gaspare |title=100 Years of Radar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoeQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-00584-3|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the unit was chosen at random by pointing at a map of Germany and [[Würzburg]] was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galati|first=Gaspare |title=100 Years of Radar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoeQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-00584-3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuMG 62 / FuMG 39 [[Würzburg radar|Würzburg]]''': 3D fire-control radar. Used to direct the flack optical directors and searchlights. Wavelength 50&amp;nbsp;cm approx. In response to jamming various models of Würzburg radar were developed to operate on various frequencies called "Islands".&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg A'''  First production version introduced in 1940. 50&amp;nbsp;cm operating wavelength. Operation range was approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km. Included an IFF system that worked with the FuG 25z airborne unit.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg B''' Integrated IR telescope to increase accuracy. Proved unsatisfactory and not placed into production.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg C''' Replaced the model A in production in 1941. Had lobe switching to improve accuracy. On this unit the integral IFF system was replaced by a system based on the FuG 25a airborne. To support this system which worked at approx 125-160&amp;nbsp;MHz two antenna were placed inside the main dish. A separate interrogation and receiving units were attached to show the IFF responses.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg D''' Replaced the model C in production in 1942. It now had a usable range of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km. Conical scan was used for fine accuracy. The IFF antenna was now fitted in the center of the dish rather than on the sides. Better instruments were fitted and generally it was the best of the small Würzburg.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''FuMG 65 Würzburg Riese(Giant)''': The electronics of the D model Würzburg combined with a 7-meter dish to improve resolution and range. Range approx 70&amp;nbsp;km. Version E was a modified unit to fit on railroad [[flatcar]]s to produce a mobile Flak radar system. Version G had the 2.4-meter antenna and electronics from a Freya installed. The antenna dipoles were inside the reflector. The reason for this was that the allies were flying very high recon flights which were above the maximum height of the Freya. The standard Würzburg Riese's 50&amp;nbsp;cm beam was too narrow to find them directly. By combining the two systems the Freya could set the Würzburg Riese onto the target.&lt;ref&gt;The Radar War: Germany's Pioneering Achievement 1904-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

=== Mannheim  ===
[[File:FuMG 64 Mannheim 41 T radars at Grove DK 1945.jpg|thumb|FuMG 64 captured by the British forces in 1945.]]
'''FuMG 63 Mainz''' The Mainz, introduced in 1941, was a development from the Wurzburg with its 3-meter solid metal reflector mounted on top of the same type of control car as used by the ‘Kurmark’. Its range was 25–35&amp;nbsp;km with an accuracy of ±10–20 meters, azimuth 0.1 degrees, and elevation ±0.3-0.5 degrees.  Only 51 units were produced before being superseded by the ‘Mannheim’.

'''FuMG 64 Mannheim''' The Mannheim was an advanced development from the ‘Mainz’. It also had a 3-meter reflector, which was now made from a lattice framework covered in a fine mesh. This was fixed to the front of a control cabin and the whole apparatus was rotated electrically. Its range was 25–35&amp;nbsp;km, with an accuracy of ±10–15 meters; azimuth and elevation accuracy of ±0.15 degrees. Though accurate enough to control Flak guns it was not deployed in large numbers. This was due to its cost (time and materials to manufacture was about 3 time that of a Würzburg D.

'''FuMG 75 Mannheim Riese''' Just as the Wurzburg’s performance was greatly improved when fitted with a 7-meter reflector, so was the Mannheim’s, and the result called a Mannheim Riese (Giant Mannheim).  There was an optical device for the initial visual acquisition of the target. With its narrow beam it was relatively immune from ‘Window’. Its accuracy and automatic tracking enabled it to be used in anti-aircraft missile research to track and control the missiles in flight. Only a handful were manufactured.

'''FuMG 68 Ansbach''' There was a need for a mobile radar with the range and accuracy of the ‘Mannheim’. The result, in 1944, was the Ansbach. It had a collapsible reflector of diameter 4.5&amp;nbsp;meters, operating on a wavelength of 53.6&amp;nbsp;cm, and peak power of 8&amp;nbsp;kW, giving it a normal range 25–35&amp;nbsp;km (70&amp;nbsp;km in search mode) with an accuracy of 30–40 meters. Azimuth and elevation accuracy was around ±0.2°. The antenna and reflector were remote controlled from a Bayern control van up to 30 meters away. The control system was based on the remote control system of the Michael microwave communication system, this was based on the Ward-Leonard AC/DC control system. The Ansbach was to be installed in large Flak batteries with six or more guns, but only a few were produced by the end of the war, and these didn’t see operational service

==Medium Range Search ==

=== Freya &amp; similar units ===
[[File:freya-radar.jpg|thumb|FuMG 401 "''Freya-Fahrstuhl''"]]
'''FuMG 450 [[Freya radar|Freya]] / FuMG 41G''': This was a 2D Early warning radar. (2D means unable to indicate height). It was used for fighter direction and target indication for the Würzburg. Operating wavelength of approx 2.4&amp;nbsp;meters (125&amp;nbsp;MHz). In response to jamming various models were developed to operate on various frequencies called "Islands". Over 1000 units delivered in various models

'''FuMG 401 / FMG 42''' FREYA - LZ (Models A - D). An Air portable version, the model differences were due to an operating frequency range being in 4 descrete bands between 91 and 200&amp;nbsp;MHz.

'''Freya-Rotschwarz and Freya-Grünschwarz''': These two systems were Freya modified to operate on the same frequency as the British radio navigation system GEE to avoid jamming. However, as by the time they were ready the Germans were jamming GEE it is not clear whether any were ever deployed.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuMG 451 A Freya Flamme''': Freya which had been built to use the "Island D" band were modified to be able to trigger the British IFF equipment. Ranges of up to 450&amp;nbsp;km were obtained. Fell from use as British IFF procedures improved.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuMG 401 Freya Fahrstuhl''': A 3D version of the Fraya. (3D means could measure height). Measurements made by moving the antenna up and down on a rack. Only a very rough estimation of height available. originally intended for early warning most of the systems produced went to help "jammed" Würzburg

'''Freya EGON''': EGON stood for Erstling Gemse Offensive Navigation system. Where Erstling was the codename of the '''Fug25a''' transceiver in the aircraft and Gemse was the codename for the receiver. The system operated on a principle similar to the British OBOE navigation system. An IFF signal was sent from a Freya, that had had its receiver antenna removed, to the aircraft. The '''Fug25a''' in the aircraft responded and the received signal was displayed as a range offset on the Freya display. Using a second transmitter and triangulation the position of the aircraft was resolved. Though the system was tested to guide night fighters it was found to be to limited by the number of aircraft that it could control at one time (the same limitation was found with Oboe). The "Y system" was used instead for night fighter control. The EGON system was used to control pathfinders for bombing raids over both England and Russia, however by now the Luftwaffe bomber force was running out of planes, pilots and fuel so the results were minimal. Work was done  using a third transmitter to improve system performance. Range with a normal Freya was up to 250&amp;nbsp;km, work was underway to use a Wasserman system instead of a Freya to increase range too 350&amp;nbsp;km. (the Freya signal was to weak to trigger the '''Fug25a''' at ranges beyond 250&amp;nbsp;km), but this was not completed.

== Long Range Search ==
[[File:Mammut-radar.JPG|thumb|FuMG 41/42 Mammut.]]
For area air defense (vs point defense) Freya's range was found to be insufficient. This led to attempts to use Freya technology to achieve greater range. This resulted in the Wassermann and Mammut. All though the Mammut units achieved their aims they were large installations, with large arrays built on bunkers. This resulted in long building times and vulnerability to air attacks. The Wassermann was a better solution in that being smaller they were harder to locate and quicker to build, 3–4 weeks. However sources indicate that they never achieved the desired range of 400&amp;nbsp;km, the best was approx 300&amp;nbsp;km. This may be why there were so many variants deployed.

'''FuMG 401 Mammut''': First deployed in 1942 this was a long range 2 D search radar. It consisted of 8 Freya class antenna arranged in a 4 x 2 configuration. It measured 25 meters wide and ten meters high and was mounted on four pylons fixed in concrete. Some installations had a second array mounted back-to-back. Each array could be electronically swung through about 100 degrees, so the dual sided array could look behind itself to continue to track bombers as they flew into Germany. Frequency was the same as Freya (125&amp;nbsp;MHz). Range was up to 300&amp;nbsp;km with a transmit power of 200 KW. Installations being very large took up to 4 months to build.

'''FuMG 402 Wassermann''': This system was deployed in 1942. It was basically 6 Freya antenna mounted on a rotation cylinder. Frequencies were similar to Freya (125&amp;nbsp;MHz) transmit power was 100 KW resulting in a usable range of approx 200&amp;nbsp;km. Three main versions were produced with sub variants in each class.

'''Wassermann L''': The original light version. Some sources indicate that it had structural problems.

'''Wassermann S''': The heavy version. first deployed late 1942 Some sources indicate it had more than 6 arrays.

'''Wassermann M''': The last family were the medium class units. Again it is not clear exactly how many Freya arrays were attached to the mast. In 1944 this version received a modification that allowed it to electronically tilt its beams by 16 degrees which allowed it to perform height determination turning its into a 3 D search radar.

'''Elefant &amp; See Elefant''': These bi-static radars were an attempt to combine jamming resistance with long range. They operated in two bands 23–28&amp;nbsp;MHz or 32–38&amp;nbsp;MHz. Range was approximately 400&amp;nbsp;km but under [[Skywave|certain RF conditions]] much greater ranges were obtained. Antenna were usually mounted on Wassermann towers (all units differed in detail from each other). 3 Elefants were in operation at the end of the war with one See Elefant. Sources are unclear what the difference between the two types were.

==Panoramic Search ==
[[File:Jagdschloß FuMG404.jpg|thumb|''FuMG 404'' captured in 1945 still in construction.]]
The first type of early-warning radar set giving panoramic display which come into operation in usually referred to as the Jagdschloss, although it’s official designation is Jagdschloss F, to distinguish it from later types, such as the Michael B and Z.

'''Jagdschloss F''': The antenna was 24 m wide and 3 m high, consisting of sixteen pairs of double horizontal transmit and receive dipoles. Above this, an 8.5 metre wide antenna array of eight vertical dipoles was mounted for the IFF.The first 62 Jagdschloss were of the Voll Wismar type using wide band antenna covering the band 1.90-2.20 metres. Another 18, used the band 1.20–1.90 meters. Range was 100&amp;nbsp;km. An optional feature known as Landbriefträger (Postman) was a remote PPI display for use with Jagdschloss. This allowed the PPI display from the radar station to be sent simultaneously to command HQ by HF cable, or by a UHF radio link.

'''Jagdschloss Michael B''': A ponderous aerial array of two rows of eighteen Würzburg mirrors measuring 56 metres long x 7 metres high was used in the Würzmann experimental early-warning radar, and formed the serial array for Jagdschloss Michael B with the array in a horizontal position. The wavelength employed, was
that of a Voll Wismar 53.0-63.8&amp;nbsp;cm. Range approx 250&amp;nbsp;km. None may have entered service, though one source mentions one entering service.

'''Forsthaus F''': This system was a development of the Jagdschloss Michael B using the so-called Euklid 25–29&amp;nbsp;cm. waveband employed by the Navy. Once more a
very long aerial array 48 metres long and about 8 metres high was used, employing a cylindrical paraboloid. A wave guide antenna (Hohlraumstrahler) was placed along the focal line with a second and a third wave guide parallel to it above and below respectively.Range was expected to be over 200&amp;nbsp;km. Probably none completed.

'''Forsthaus KF''': Development of the Forsthaus F. Reduced in size so that the system would fit in a railway carriage. Antenna 24 meters long. Range 120&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Dreh Freya''': This set, which was also known as '''Freya Panorama''', was first introduced in June 1944. It consisted of a Freya aerial of the Breitband type working in Bereich I (1.90-2.50), the frequency of which could be adjusted at will. The aerial was so built that it rotated through 360° and gave a remote
panoramic presentation. About 20 equipments were in use in January 1945. The range claimed for it was only about 100&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Jagdhütte''':This apparatus, which was produced by Siemens, gave a panoramic P.P.I. display of the German I.F.F. responses, using 24 metre or 36 metre rotating aerials. The wavelength employed was 2.40 metres and it was planned, with its aid, to trigger off the FuGe 25A. In this way friendly fighters were to be controlled from the ground at ranges up to about 300&amp;nbsp;km. It was fully realised that if the FuGe 25A frequency was ever jammed the Jagdhütte would be useless, but it was not considered likely that the Allies would attempt to jam it. Small numbers may have been completed at the wend of the war.

'''Jagdwagen''': Jagdwagen was designed as a mobile Panoramic radar to control fighters at close ranges immediately behind the front. It was a project of the firm of Lorenz. The aerials were considerably smaller than the Jagdhütte, the array being only 8 metres long. The aerial array was to be mounted on the Kumbach stand as used in the Egerland Flak set. The frequency bend used was that of the A.S.V. set Hohentwiel namely 53–59&amp;nbsp;cm. Range 40–60&amp;nbsp;km. Prototypes only.

'''Jagdhaus (FuMG 404)''': Jagdhaus was designed and built by Lorenz in 1944 as an early warning radar. It was the most powerful radar built by the Germans, with a peak pulse power of 300&amp;nbsp;kW, which Lorenz planned to increase to 750&amp;nbsp;kW. The whole assembly was the size of a house, which is possibly how it got its name; ‘haus’ being the German for ‘house’. The rotating upper part of the construction housed the separate parabolic transmit and receive antennae and reflectors, with the IFF above them as usual. It weighed 48 tons and rotated at 10 rpm. It operated on wavelengths of 1.4 to 1.8 metres, and had a range of about 300&amp;nbsp;km. It could measure altitude, azimuth and range. The control room was located below the antennae, from which its PPI image was also transmitted to command HQ at Charlottenberg by Landbrieftrager, similar to the Jagdschloss system. It is believed that only one Jagdhaus was constructed, which fell into Soviet hands when it was captured by their troops in 1945, during which time it was damaged. The Soviets compelled the Germans to repair it and instruct them in its operation.

== Airborne Intercept ==
[[File:Lichtenstein-radar.jpg|thumb|''Lichtenstein B/C FuG 202'' with 32-dipole "mattress" aerials]]
'''[[Lichtenstein radar|Lichtenstein]] B/C - FuG 202''': Low-UHF band frequency range, introduced in 1941 it was the initial AI radar. Deployed in large numbers with 32-dipole element ''Matratze'' (mattress) antenna arrays, it operated on the 61&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength. Its range was (in theory) 2–3&amp;nbsp;km but in practise was found to be dependent on factors such as height. Compromised to the Allies [[Junkers Ju 88#Ju 88R|on May 9, 1943]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galati|first=Gaspare |title=100 Years of Radar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoeQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-00584-3|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lichtenstein C-1 - FuG 212''': Introduced in 1943, this was an improved version of the FuG 202.

'''Lichtenstein SN2 - FuG 220''': Low-mid VHF band frequency range, introduced in 1943 in response to Allied jamming, and used an eight-dipole ''Hirschgeweih'' (atag's antlers) antenna array. Transmitter power of 2Kw on 3.3 meters. Range was increased to 6&amp;nbsp;km. Minimum range was 400 m which was found to be a problem, hence aircraft carried it and FuG202. Later versions did away for the need for the Fug 202. Compromised to the Allies [[Lichtenstein radar#FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2|in July 1944]].

'''Lichtenstein SN3 - FuG 228''': A higher powered version of the SN2. Range increased to 8&amp;nbsp;km. Only a small number accepted into service, perhaps only prototypes.

''' FuG 214 ''': This was an "add-on" unit to the SN2 which gave it an additional, ''rear''-facing antenna installation. This was in response to Allied night fighters accompanying the bomber steams to hunt the German Night fighters while the hunted the bombers. The idea was to prevent allied fighters attacking the German fighters from behind.

''' Neptun 1 - FuG 216''': A small number of experimental sets fitted to FW190 and BF109. 1.3 to 1.8 meters wavelength.

''' Neptun 2 - FuG 217''': A small number of sets fitted to FW190 and BF109. 1.6 to 1.8 meters wavelength. Some has a rear warning component.

'''Neptun 3 - Fug 218''': A replacement for SN2, deployed late 1944 after SN2 was jammed. Wavelength 1.6 to 1.9 meters, most often using same, eight-dipole "stag's antlers" antenna array with shorter dipole elements. Range up to 5&amp;nbsp;km.  Some were fitted to me 262 to create night fighters that could catch Mosquito intruders.

''' Neptun 4 - FuG 219''': Increased power version of the  FuG218, experimental sets only.

''' Berlin A - FuG 224''': The first centimetric (3 GHz) band radar. Based on a captured H2S radar unit, codenamed "Rotterdams". Unknown number built but under 100. Range 5K under ideal conditions, 10&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength.

''' Berlin N1 - FuG 240 N''': Combination of the Berlin A and the SN2. Only small numbers delivered.

''' Berlin N2''': Increased power Berlin  N, Range reported to be 9K.

'''Berlin N3/N4''': Experimental units.

'''Bremen - FuG 244''': (also known as Berlin D) Berlin A with the frequency changed to 3&amp;nbsp;cm (10 GHz) rather than 9&amp;nbsp;cm. Experimental.

'''Bremen O - FuG 245''': Another experiments 3&amp;nbsp;cm unit.

==Air to Surface Search ==

'''Neptun''': Early system - It failed its acceptance tests - the system was later reworked into an Airborne intercept set.

[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|'''Hohentwiel (FuG 200)''']]; UHF-band radar, operated at wavelength between 52 and 57&amp;nbsp;cm. Range was between 10&amp;nbsp;km for a small vessel like a surfaced submarine to 70&amp;nbsp;km for a large ship. Under the best circumstances it could see the coast at approx 150&amp;nbsp;km. It had separate antennae for transmit and receive. The transmit antenna was centrally mounted, pointing forward, while the two receive antennae were mounted either side, pointing outwards by 30 degrees, giving it a search beam width of about 120 degrees. Each antenna array consisted of sixteen horizontally polarised dipoles, mounted in four groups of four in a vertical stack.

A variant of the '''Hohentwiel''' the '''Tiefentwiel (FuMG407)'''; was tried as an Air Surveillance radar on the coast to try and detect low flying aircraft.

==Naval Surface Search - Land Based - ''Seetakt''==

'''FuMO 1 - Calis A''': Its 6.2 x 2.5m antenna consisted of 2 rows of eight full wave vertical dipoles. Its wavelength was 82&amp;nbsp;cm and its range depended on the height it was installed above sea level, but typically was about 15–20&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="KaufmannKaufmann2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kaufmann|first1=J.E|last2=Kaufmann|first2=H.W.  |last3= Jankovie-Potoenik |first3=A.|title=The Atlantic Wall: History and Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nHuSIG45WsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT289|accessdate=24 December 2017|date=19 September 2012|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78337-838-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the frequency low angle reflections from the surface, also known a clutter would have been an issue.

'''FuMO 215''': Improved range version of the FuMO214.

==Centimeter Radars  ==
All though the Germans were carrying out research at centimeter wavelengths at the start of the war the work was abandoned as it was decided that the war would be over before the research &amp; development could be completed. In February 1943 a RAF Stirling bomber was shot down over Rotterdam and a damaged H2S system was recovered. The Germans started a crash development program to use the information deduced from the captured system. All though a range of prototypes were produced, very few reached front line troops. Due to the device being recovered near Rotterdam the Germans used that name in several code names for the Centimeter (9&amp;nbsp;cm) systems, such as "Rotterdam Device".

'''Rotterdam''': To get the quickest start with development, German industry copied, as far as possible, the H2S system. Approximately 20 systems were manufactured for R&amp;D work. They led to the '''Roderich''' jammer and the '''Berlin''' &amp; '''Korfu''' receivers.

'''Jagdschloss Z''': The 9&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Jagdschloss F panoramic radar system. Prototypes only.

'''Forsthaus Z''': The 9&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Forsthaus panoramic search radar. Prototypes only.

'''FuMG 77''': Rotterheim. A combination of the 9&amp;nbsp;cm receiver/transmitter of the Berlin system with the Antenna and other systems from a Mannheim. Its range was about 30&amp;nbsp;km and it was found to be unaffected by allied jamming. Its name changed to Marbach V later in the war.

'''FuMG 76''': Marbach. A combination of the Berlin transmitter/receiver with the Ansback 4.5 meter reflector and systems. Controlled by the "Michael" remote control system. Sources suggest that 3 systems were completed.

'''FuMG 74''': Kulmbach. A 9&amp;nbsp;cm panoramic search radar. 6 meter antenna and remote controlled like the FuMG76. When combined with that radar it was known as the '''Egerland''' system. Only 2 completed. range of approx 50&amp;nbsp;km.

==Passive Search==
'''FuG 221 Freya-Halbe ''': This was a Freya modified to locate British airborne jammers. Development completed but due to lack of parts never deployed.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuG 221 Rosendahl'''; This was a Freya modified to locate British bombers by tracking their Monica warning radar emissions. By the time development was completed the British had ceased using Monica, so never deployed&lt;ref name = ADIK390 &gt;http://www.cdvandt.org/ADIK390all.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuG 223''': A family of passive airborne receivers tuned to various radar bands such as Freya and Würzburg. Designed to allow night fighters to home onto bombers fitted with jammers against those radars. The '''Fug223''' was a version build from surplus '''FuG 227''' components that detected reflected energy from an aircraft being illuminated by a ground radar. In this way it was an example of an early semi-active radar homing system. In order to work it seems that the radar beam had to illuminate the target and the night fighter so that the two receivers could be synchronized. Used by one test and development squadron at the end of the war.

'''FuG 227''': Built using some components from the '''FuG 220''' range of AI equipment. This was a passive device which allowed night fighters to home onto bombers which had their rear warning 'Monica' active. Monica was a short range VHF radar (200&amp;nbsp;MHz band) which was fitted to the tail of British heavy bombers facing down and back to give the rear turret gunner a warning display. Using this equipment the night fighters could achieve intercept with apparent ease. Extremely effective until the British captured a Me 110 with '''FuG227''' installed and realised its mode of operation. there after Monica was removed from bombers and '''FuG227''' ceased to have any value.

'''Klein Heidelberg''' was the code-name give to a passive radar system devised in 1941. The system was a bi-static radar system. What was unusual was that the transmitters were British rather than German! The system worked by using the reflections from the Chain Home (British coastal radar system) rather than transmitters associated with the receivers. Klein Heidelberg worked by sensing Chain Home (CH) transmission pulses directly with a small auxiliary antenna, close to the main antenna, whose receiver was tuned to a particular CH station whose exact location, bearing and range was known. The CH signal was then used to synchronise the KH with the CH transmission pulses. The CH pulse started a circular trace on a cathode ray tube (CRT) divided into forty sections. The main antenna received the reflection of these pulses from the target and displayed them on the CRT. Range was between 300–600&amp;nbsp;km. The display was 2D. Resolution was not very good but it allowed the Germans to see bomber formations forming up over England and the general path of the bomber streams. Its big advantage was it was not possible for the British to jam without jamming their own radars. The system entered service in late 1943 and by late 1944 six system were commissioned on the Dutch coast.

[[Naxos radar detector|'''FuG 350 Naxos''']] &amp; '''FuG 351 Korfu''': This was a family or radar detectors that operated in the 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;cm band. They were primarily designed to locate Allied H2S radar transmissions. A range of antenna were used some stationary and some rotating. There were intended to be air, land and maritime versions. However Naxos had a resolution problem that limited its ability to distinguish individual aircraft. This allowed the night fighter to locate the bomber stream but not usually individual bombers. This was not usually an issue with the maritime based system (primarily U boats) as there was usually only one aircraft detected at a time. To reduce this issue an improved version the '''Korfu''' was developed. It was intended to field '''Korfu''' as a replacement for Naxos in all three versions but due to a shortage of components only the land based version was fielded where is resolution could be used to the best effect.&lt;ref name = ADIK369&gt;http://www.cdvandt.org/ADIK369all.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuG 350 Naxos Z''': The original system, detected H2S radar system on bombers. Unable to distinguish individual bombers nor the 10 GHz [[H2X]] Allied bombing radar, but could reliably guide the fighter into the bomber stream.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZR''': Additional aerials added a tail warning system which allowed British night-fighters to be detected.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZX''': 3&amp;nbsp;cm version for detecting allied H2X radars. Not known to have ever been fielded.

'''FuG 350 Naxos RX''': 3&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Naxos ZR. Not known to have ever been fielded.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZD''': Combined Z and ZX, allowing 9&amp;nbsp;cm and 3&amp;nbsp;cm detection in the same system.

'''FuG 351 Korfu Z''': Entered production late 1944, due to shortage of components only ground-based versions deployed though an airborne version completed development. better range and discrimination than Naxos.

'''FuG 280 Kiel Z''': IR based passive receiver. 10 degree field of view - display via CRT. problems with discrimination between fires aircraft and other IR sources.&lt;ref name = ADIK369 /&gt;

''' Falter''': Based on the Fug 280 K but detected British IR recognition systems. Development not completed.&lt;ref name = ADIK369 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9320">'''Hebrew spelling''' ({{lang-he|כתיב עברי}} {{IPA|/ktiv ʕivˈri/}}, "Hebrew spelling") refers to the way words are spelled in the [[Hebrew language]]. The [[Hebrew alphabet]] contains 22 letters, all of which are primarily consonants.  This is because the Hebrew script is an [[abjad]], that is, its letters indicate consonants, not vowels or syllables. An early system to overcome this, still used today, is [[mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']], where four of these letters, [[Aleph|alef]], [[He (letter)|he]], [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] also serve as vowel letters. Later, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed.

==History==
{{Further information|Biblical Hebrew orthography}}
Throughout history, there have been two main systems of Hebrew spelling. One is vocalized spelling, the other is unvocalized spelling.

In vocalized spelling (''[[ktiv menuqad]]''), all of the vowels are indicated by vowel points (called [[niqqud]]). In unvocalized spelling (''[[ktiv hasar niqqud]]''), the vowel points are omitted, but some of them are substituted by additional vowel letters - [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] (''Ktiv malē''). This system is the spelling system commonly used in Israel today.

Vowel points are always optional in Hebrew. They can be used fully, partially or not used at all. The recommended approach endorsed today by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and other Israeli educational institutions is to use ''plēnē'' spelling (''matres lectionis'') when not adding vowel dots (which is the usual case), and place a vocalization sign on a letter only when ambiguity cannot be resolved otherwise. The [[defective script|"defective" spelling]] is recommended for a fully vocalized text, hence its use is becoming rare. Texts older than 50–60 years may be written in an unvocalized ''defective'' spelling (for example, the word ''ħamiším'' "fifty", was written חמשים on banknotes issued in [[Mandatory Palestine]] or the [[Bank of Israel]] in its early days. Today, the common spelling is חמישים). A vocalized ''plene'' spelling system is common in children books, when it is better to accustom the children to the more popular ''plene'' spelling, while still letting them benefit from the vowel dots as a reading aid in early learning stages.

A third system that was endorsed in the past by the Academy of the Hebrew Language as an optimal system, but abandoned due to low popularity, calls for the use of ''ħolám'' (וֹ), ''šurúq'' (וּ), ''dagéš'' in ''Bet'', ''Kaf'' and ''Pe'' (בּ, כּ, פּ vs. ב, כ, פ), ''Šin Smalít'' (שׂ) and ''mappíq'' (הּ), while abandoning all other vowel dots (in everyday writing). According to this system, ''matres lectionis'' are still introduced to mark vowels, but the letter ''Vav'' is used only as a consonant, while its variants ''ħolám'' and ''šurúq'' serve as vowel letters. This system also makes clear distinction between final ''He'' used as a vowel marker (e.g. ילדה {{IPA|/jalˈda/}} "a girl" ) and as a consonant (e.g. ילדהּ {{IPA|/jalˈdah/}} "her child"). This system was never extensively used, and the Academy of the Hebrew Language finally abandoned it in 1992, when new rules were published not assuming any use of vowel dots.

Rules for unvocalized spelling were first issued by the Hebrew Language Committee in 1890 (which became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] in 1953) and formally standardised in 1996. Even though the rules are established, some of the rules and specific spellings are disputed by writers and publishers, who often create their own in-house spelling system. Also, because having two spelling systems within the same language is confusing, some would like to reform it. In 2004, [[Mordechai Mishor]], one of the academy's linguists, proposed in a session of the Academy of the Hebrew Language a modest reform.&lt;ref name="KD"&gt;[http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn12-3spell.html Kernerman Dictionary News • Number 12 • July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage today==
There are three systems of spelling used for [[Modern Hebrew]].
#'''Ktiv hasar''' ("missing spelling"): This [[defective script]] may be found in the [[Sefer Torah]] read in [[synagogue]]. It is sometimes considered to be [[anachronism|anachronistic]] in everyday life, although it is still sometimes found in newspapers and published books.&lt;ref name="maamarim"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.articles.co.il/print.php?id=46399 |first = Einat |last = Kedem|publisher = articles.co.il |title=כתיב מלא (בעיות), כתיב חסר (היגיון)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the original Hebrew spelling. It is called the "missing spelling" because it does not use [[niqqud]].
#'''[[Ktiv menuqad]]''' ("dotted spelling" or "vowelized spelling"): This system of spelling is called "vowelized spelling" and "dotted spelling" because unlike "missing spelling," this system shows exactly how the vowels are in addition to using the dots system ("[[niqqud|nekudot]]"). It is rarely used in everyday life. However, it is used wherever someone wants their writings to be clear and unambiguous, such as children books, poetry, language instruction for newcomers, or ambiguous or foreign terms. However, it is very cumbersome and inconvenient in everyday life.
#'''Ktiv male''' or '''[[Ktiv hasar niqqud]]''' ("full spelling" or "spelling lacking niqqud"): This is the dominant system of spelling in Israel, personal correspondence, movie subtitles, etc.&lt;ref name="maamarim" /&gt;  Ktiv Male is created to be a niqqud-less spelling that uses ''matres lectionis'' (consonant that are also used as vowels: [[aleph]], [[He (letter)|he]], waw, yodh) instead of the vowel pointers.

To illustrate the problem with Ktiv haser:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|אויר}} -  {{IPA|/U'jar/}} = "was drawn" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|אוּיָר}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|חלקה}} -  {{IPA|/ħelˈqa/}} = "land plot" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|חֶלְקַה}} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; spelled the same as {{Hebrew|שנים}} -  {{IPA|/ˈʃanim/}} = "years" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|שָׁנִים}}

==Usage of multiple systems==
{{multiple image
 | align     = right
 | direction = horizontal

 | footer_align = left/right/center
 | footer_background = 
 | width     = 
 | image1    = Kosher McDonalds.JPG
 | width1    = 235
 | caption1  = A kosher (הכשר "the Kosher") [[McDonald's]], with the word kosher spelled without niqqud.
 | image2    = Kosher McDonald's restaurant in Ramat-Gan.jpg
 | width2    = 205
 | caption2  = Another kosher (הכּשר "the Kosher") McDonald's, with the word kosher spelled with partial niqqud to reduce ambiguity.
}}
In practice, many times two or more spelling systems are used in one text. The most common example of this is a word may be vowelized (using [[niqqud]], the "dots") partially, for instance with {{Hebrew|אוֹמץ}}, where only the vav ({{Hebrew|ו}}) is vowelized. This clarifies that the vowel is an "o" ({{Hebrew|וֹ}}) and not "u" ({{Hebrew|וּ}}). In addition, 3 letters (historically 6), can take a different sound depending on if there is a dot (called a [[dagesh]]) in the middle of the letter (a [[bet (letter)|bet]], [[Kaph|kaf]], and [[Pe (letter)|pe]]). In full spelling, the dot is not included, regardless if it is making one sound or the other. An example when a mixture of systems would be used is to clarify when the letter is taking a dagesh. An example of this is shown in the adjacent picture, where for the word kosher ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}} &lt;small&gt;(with niqqud)&lt;/small&gt;, {{hebrew|כשר}} &lt;small&gt;(full spelling)&lt;/small&gt;, {{IPA|/kaˈʃer/}}) may be written as כּשר (a mixture of the two systems) to be unambiguous that it is the letter כּ {{IPA-he|k|}} and not כ {{IPA-he|χ|}}. Words may be written in ''ktiv haser'' ("missing spelling") if it is unambiguous and clear enough (ex. חנכה {{IPA|/[[Hanukkah|ħanuˈka]]/}} instead of the "full" form חנוכה). In this case, the reader deciphers the word mostly by its context.

Also, some words are almost always written in the "missing" form (''ktiv haser'') in everyday life: לא ({{IPA|/lo/}}, no), אמא ({{IPA|/ima/}}, mother), אם ({{IPA|/im/}}, if), and כנרת ({{IPA|/kiˈneret/}}, [[Kinneret (archaeological site)|Kinneret]]).

ico-D members include professional design organisations, design promotion bodies, design media, design education institutions and individuals with a vested interest in professional design. Design media are affiliated through the International Design Media Network (IDMN). Individuals are affiliated through the ico-D's Friends Network which was established in 1991.&lt;ref name="IcogradaAbout" /&gt;

==International affiliations and alliances==
ico-D coordinates best international practices for communication design. It maintains affiliations with other international organisations such as [[Cumulus Association]],&lt;ref name="CumulusMemo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cumulusassociation.org/component/content/1-current-affairs/1130-icograda-and-cumulus-signed-memorandum-of-understanding/225 | title=Icograda and Cumulus signed Memorandum of Understanding | publisher=Cumulus | date=2012-01-28 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Guellerin, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFRRO]],&lt;ref name="IFRRO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifrro.org/members/international-council-communication-design | title=International Council of Communication Design | publisher=IFRRO | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO]],&lt;ref name="ISO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/about/organizations_in_liaison/organizations_in_liaison_details.htm?id=9266&amp;LiaisonList=True | title=Organizations in cooperation with ISO | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]], [[UNIDO]], [[WIPO]], and [[ECOSOC]].&lt;ref name="ECOSOC Civil Society Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&amp;type=ngo&amp;nr=257&amp;section=9|title=ECOSOC Civil Society Network|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding history==
[[Peter Kneebone]] proposed the idea to establish an international organisation for graphic design and was involved in Icograda's founding.&lt;ref name="Muesuem of London"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/festival/kneebone.htm | title=The Festival of Britain | publisher=Museum of London | date=2001-09-10 | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Industrial Artists (which changed its name in 1963 to the Society of Industrial Artists &amp; Designers, and is now the Chartered Society of Designers, or CSD) set up a working group under the chairmanship of [[Willy de Majo]], to promote the creation of an organisation to represent internationally the many professional graphic design associations throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/willy-de-majo-archive | title=Willy de Mayo Archive | publisher=University of Brighton Faculty of Arts | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such organisation existed. The profession was rapidly growing in importance, and also attempting to clarify its identity and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; It was involved in increasingly complex social and technological situations. National associations were developing, but international dialogue and action were intermittent and uncoordinated. It was important to create links between the professional associations in all countries, and between the profession and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;W.M. de Mayo, 1990. 'A vision realized'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary''&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural conference of Icograda took place at Watney House, London, from 26–28 April 1963, attended by delegates from 28 associations in 17 European countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"&gt;Peter Kneebone, 1990. 'Icograda: reflections on a history'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was chaired by [[Henri Kay Henrion|H.K. Henrion]] and supported by Kneebone as secretary. On 27 April, the meeting agreed to formally establish Icograda. Proposals that were ratified include the development and drafts of a ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', a ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers'', ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', an ''International Directory of Organizations Concerned with Graphic Design'' and the publication of a News Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Executive Board was elected at the meeting in London, composed of Willy de Majo (Great Britain, President), [[Wim Crouwel|Wim H. Crouwel]] (The Netherlands, Secretary General), Martin Gavier (Sweden, Treasurer), Peter Hatch (Great Britain, Vice President), Hans Neuburg (Switzerland, Vice President), Jukka Pellinen (Finland, Vice President), D. Stojannovic-Sip (Yugoslavia, Vice President), John Tandy (Great Britain, Member), Pieter Brattinga (The Netherlands, Member) and Paul Schwarz (The Netherlands, Honorary Treasurer). This Executive Board served from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same meeting, the first Icograda Congress and General Assembly in 1964 in Zurich was called in order to establish the aims and structures upon which the future of the organisation rested.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2013, Icograda celebrated its 50th anniversary and its 25th General Assembly.&lt;ref name="50thAnniversary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/events/calendar1081.htm |title=25 Icograda General Assembly: Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=Icograda |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and activities==

===1960s===
The first Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in 1964 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm | title=Congress History | publisher=Icograda | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by about 200 designers from 17 countries and 23 associations. The theme of the Congress was Commercial Artist or Graphic Designer".&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt; The Congress opened with the reading of a message by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] who wrote: “Every day designers of all kinds are becoming responsible for a greater proportion of man's environment. Almost everything that we see and use that was not made by the Almighty has come from some designer's drawing board. This is a very heavy responsibility and every effort by designers to improve standards, to encourage proper training and to develop a sense of social awareness is to be welcomed.”&lt;ref&gt;The original letter is housed at the Icograda Archive, University of Brighton&lt;/ref&gt; At the General Assembly, delegates Icograda's aims and objectives, and it was further agreed to establish an audio-visual archive and library, to publish a news bulletin and to award student scholarships. Jenny Toynbee from Edinburgh School of Art won the first student scholarship. Ernest Hoch's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/obit.html |title=The optimism of modernity : documents |publisher=Optimism-modernity.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/hoch-catalogue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/metric-typo/hoch77.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposals for a unified system of typographic measurement was accepted for further development.

In 1965 Icograda establishes the Signs and Symbols Commission. It first collaborates closely with the International Chamber of Commerce and then with the [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]. In the same year Icograda publishes ''Graphic journalism: Catalogue of Magazines and Annuals of Graphic Design and Allied Subjects'' featuring around 300 journals from 30 countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt;

In April 1966 the first Icograda International Student Project was judged in Belgrade. The theme was 'Public information signs' and the jury included Abram Games, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Paul Rand, Masaru Katzumie and Ivan Picelj.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hitchins, 2013, ''An Icograda love story'', article to be published in November 2013 as part of the Icograda Legacy Initiative collection&lt;/ref&gt; The second Icogarada Congress, 'Graphic Design and Visual Communication Technology', and General Assembly were then held from 11–16 July 1966 in Bled, then in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm |title=Congress History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buckminster Fuller|R Buckminster Fuller]] was one of the main speakers at the Congress. At the General Assembly, four key policy documents were ratified: ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', the ''Honorarium for Judges of International Competitions'' document and the revised ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', and the ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers''. [[:no:Knut Yran|Knut Yran]], head of design at Phillips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.philips.com/about/design/aboutus/designheritage/index.page |title=Philips - Design - Our design heritage |publisher=Design.philips.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Eindhoven, was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] from the Netherlands, Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory" /&gt; The first student seminar was also held in Bled from 11–13 July 1966 and the theme was 'Breaking the Language Barrier with Signs and Symbols'. In addition, the production of ''Equality of Man'', a film project for students and young people in support of the United Nations Human Rights Year, was the first of several Icograda collaborations with [http://asifa.net/ International Animated Film Association (ASIFA)]

The third Icograda Congress 'Design Destinations in a Changing World' was held in 1968 in Eindhoven.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory" /&gt; An exhibition of Belgian graphics was organised by Michel Olyff at the same time and the entire congress decamped to Brussels for a day. "Sachez que tout en ce monde n’est que signes et signes de signes" (beware that all in the world is only signs and signs of signs), were the words of Marcel Schwab quoted by Alderman van der Harten in opening the congress. Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, "but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Icograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political émigrés who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.

At the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.

===1970s===
In 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that "the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week."

The first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.

In 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.

In 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.

In 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from Düsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.

In 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.

The 1977 Zurich Congress − 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' − was complimented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne − 'A Town and its Image' − and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.

In 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef Müller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar − 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'

===1980s===
In 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. In the same year, ''World design sources directory 1980 = Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getcited.org/pub/101980835 |title=(1980) World design sources directory 1980: Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980 |publisher=Getcited.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Centre de Creation Industrielle, was published on behalf of Icograda and ICSID.

The first Icograda, ICSID and IFI Joint Congress took place in Helsinki from 1–8 August 1981, an event that had been under discussion since 1977. The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''. Also in 1981, Icograda organised a poster competition on behalf of UNESCO to celebrate the International Year of Disabled Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32403&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO.ORG &amp;#124; International Year of Disabled Persons |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000483/048396eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the first of six issues of ''icographic/volume 2'' was published on behalf of Icograda by Mobilia Press, with Jorge Frascara as associate editor. Each issue was devoted to a single theme and abstracts were included in four languages. Also in 1982, Haig David-West organised the first African regional meeting in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and in 1983, Haig David-West (the first ever elected Icograda Executive board member from Africa)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; edited the publication ''Dialogue on graphic design problems in Africa'', based on this meeting.

In 1983 the 10th General Assembly and Icograda Congress '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Design Interaction''' were held in Dublin.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The keynote address was given by [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] of the United Nations. In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where "I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable – the only answer".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating "rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to – but in that order – literacy"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; he called on the delegates to "offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see – literally see – both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said "I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task... History will once again make its awesome judgement of you – but from now on with greater respect because you cannot any longer be underestimated. You help all of us perceive and place ourselves in life. Now you must help all of us understand so that we can more wisely and assuredly manage all our futures".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Raymond Kyne was elected President&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and Robert Blaich won the President's Award for his promotion of Icograda-Philips design award.&lt;ref name="icograda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1920.htm |title=President's Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of member organisations had by grown to 50. A multidisciplinary design competition on the theme of ''Shu/Collectivity'', held under the auspices of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and sponsored by the Japan Design Foundation, was won by Charles Owen from the Illinois Institute of Technology.

In 1985, the 11th Icograda Congress ''The place and influence of graphic design in everyday life'' was organised by Philippe Gentil&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; in Nice, the first time that there were major presentations from India ('design without designers' by people whose needs were too urgent to await intervention by professionals) and Australia (from boomerang to bicentenary); from the design of books in China to street signs in Buenos Aires, and provocatively 'the backside of design' – what happens after the consultant has moved on to new, more rewarding problems. According to Stephen Hitchins (Icograda board member from 1987−1991),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ivan Chermayeff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgstudionyc.com/about-us/ivan-chermayeff |title=Ivan Chermayeff &amp;#124; Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv |publisher=Cgstudionyc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a long presentation totally devoid of visuals stating that he "wanted graphics to grow up" – comparing much of it "to WC Fields' definition of a virgin: a child about four years old, extremely ugly". So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, "a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over. At the 11th Icograda General Assembly (also in Nice) [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] was elected president. The President's Trophy went to Jan Railich, the chairman of the Brno Biennale.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Also in 1985, the ''World Directory of Design Schools and Programmes'' was published jointly by Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and edited by Maarten Regouin, secretary of the Icograda Education Working Group, which also coincided with Icograda's establishment of the Design History and Design Management working groups chaired by Michael Twyman and Abe Rosenfeld respectively.

In 1986 Icograda Excellence Awards were made for the first time at the Brno and Warsaw Biennales. The recipients were Christof Gassner and Henryk Tomaszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1922.htm |title=Excellence Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Amrik Kalsi, [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] and Peter Kneebone organised the ''Graphic Design for Development Seminar'' on behalf of Icograda and UNESCO. It was hosted in Nairobi, Kenya, from 6–10 July and attracted 91 participants from 14 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000833/083352eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/feature/current/articles1127.htm?query_page=1 |title=GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR DEVELOPMENT - PART 1 OF 2 |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID, IFI ''Design 87'' − with as its theme 'Design Response' − was held in Amsterdam from 16–20 August 1987.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the 12th Icograda General Assembly which took place from 21–22 August (also in Amsterdam), Niko Spelbrink was elected president and Mary V. Mullin became Secretary-General (and Director of the Icograda Secretariat – a position she held until 1999).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Susumu Sakane was awarded the President's Trophy.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Uwe Loesch won the first Icograda Excellence Award to be presented at the Lahti Biennale. Icograda published the ''History of Design Bibliography'' edited by [[Victor Margolin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~victor/index.html |title=victor's home page |publisher=Tigger.uic.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Projects in Graphic Design Education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frascara-noel.net/publications3.html |title=Publications |publisher=FrascaraNoel |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara.

In 1988, Nils Tvengsberg organised a special event in Oslo, from 13–15 May, to mark the 25th anniversary of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; All 11 presidents from 1963-onwards attended together with many former board members, partners, friends and supporters. It coincided with Norway's national day and according to Stephen Hitchins, "it was one of the more remarkable Icograda events in a history of remarkable events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list276 |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Nils Tvengsberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list372.htm |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to serve on the boards of both Icograda and ICSID simultaneously. His goal was to look at the possibility of joining their common interests. It would be over 20 years before this partnership, the International Design Alliance (IDA), would be headquartered in Montreal, contemplating the first IDA joint congress in 2011.

In 1989 the 13th Congress took place at Tel Aviv University, chaired by Abe Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The theme was 'Graphic Design Through High Technology?' At the General Assembly Simon de Hartog won the President's Award,&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; and Helmut Langer became President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Graphic Design, World Views. A celebration of ICOGRADA’s 25th Anniversary'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jdExAQAAIAAJ | title = Graphic design, world views: A celebration of Icograda's 25th anniversary | isbn = 9780870119002 | author1 = Frascara | first1 = Jorge | last2 = Associations | first2 = International Council of Graphic Design | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara, designed by Niko Spelbrink, and with a cover designed by [[Grapus]], was published jointly by Icograda and Kodansha, a major book on graphic design that celebrated Icograda's 25th anniversary.

The Icograda Foundation was established in 1991 for the advancement of worldwide understanding and education through the effective use of graphic design. A limited company, the Foundation was a registered charity funded by corporate sponsorships, individual donations, legacies, and various fundraising activities. Mary Mullin received the President's Award for her work in establishing the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles149.htm |title=Foundation |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comdevelopment Ltd |url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/the-icograda-foundation |title=The Icograda Foundation of HP4 3NE in Berkhamsted Hertfordshire |publisher=Companiesintheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/1003880 |title=Icograda Foundation |publisher=OpenCharities |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the 14th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in Montréal, from 25–29 August, attended by around 2,000 delegates.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the Icograda General Assembly (30–31 August 1991), [[Giancarlo Iliprandi]] was elected president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Highlights of the Assembly included: the hosting of the 3rd Marijke Singer Memorial Lecture presented by Margaret Catley Carlson, entitled ''Images for the Next Century''; the Icograda President's Award was bestowed on Mary V. Mullin for the inauguration of the Icograda Foundation and the Friends of Icograda;&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; establishment of the Icograda World Graphic Design Day;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/worlddesignday.htm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; World Communication Design Day |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishment of Icograda Steering Committee for the International Design Archive and Research Centre Project; and the establishment of Icograda Friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/categories/articles125.htm |title=Friends |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with seed donations contributed by 68 Japanese founders, chaired by Hiroshi Kojitani. In the same year, the first ''Icograda/IFI/ICSID Joint Newsletter'' was published.

In 1993 the 3rd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID and IFI was held in Glasgow, Ireland from 5–9 September.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Stephen Hitchins chaired the organising committee and there were 101 speakers and over 1,000 delegates. [[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been “the most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years”. Jeremy Myerson called it "a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, "Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is [[Yuri Soloviev]]'s story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it − keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

From 23–27 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto. The theme of the Congress was ''Shifting Frontiers''. At the 16th Icograda General Assembly, Jose Korn Bruzzone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/media/releases/articles911.htm |title=Jose Korn Bruzzone to Deliver Education Keynote at Icograda World Design Congress 2007 |publisher=Icograda |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Chile became President and the Icograda President's Award was presented to Marion Wesel-Henrion and J.

In 1996, Icograda released a policy document ''Digital Immortality: Encapsulating the Work of the World's Top 20th Century Designers for an Icograda Archive in digital form'' aimed to establish a comprehensive archive for Icograda and the work of leading graphic design masters. In the same year, Icograda participated in a meeting of the Icograda/ICSID/IFI working group founded to develop closer working relations between the three organisations which took place from 7–8 December in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The 17th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place from 21–23 October in Punte del Este, Uruguay.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; This was the first Icograda Congress to be hosted in the Southern Hemisphere and attracted ±1 000 delegates. The Congress theme was 'INTERCAMBIOS/EXCHANGES'. At this General Assembly in Punte del Este, the Icograda Assembly joined the ICSID and IFI General Assemblies to unanimously pass a resolution which called for closer contact between the "three sisters," paving the path towards the formation of the International Design Alliance (IDA), which was eventually established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |title=International Design Alliance |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528090348/http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy-A Schockaert from Belgium became President and Mary V. Mullin was again elected Secretary General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In early 1999, Mary V. Mullin resigned as the Icograda Secretary General and Director of the Icograda Secretariat after serving 12 years in the position. The Secretariat relocated from London to Brussels under the new leadership of Thierry van Kerm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thierry-van-kerm/6/609/13a |title=Thierry Van Kerm |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was appointed as Icograda Director in June of the same year.

''Sydney Design 99: Viewpoints in Time'', the 4th joint Icograda/ICSID/IFI Congress took place from 26–29 September in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Around 1 400 delegates from 45 countries attended the event. The 18th Icograda General Assembly followed immediately after the Congress, 30 September-1 October in Sydney. At the Assembly, David Grossman from Israel become President and Martha Bateman from South Africa was elected as Secretary General (Bateman was only the second person from Africa to serve on the Executive Board and the first to serve in a senior position). At this GA the Council officially separated the positions of Secretary General and Director of the Secretariat (paid position) functions.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the 19th Icograda General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the GA ratified a Joint motion of Icograda, ICSID and IFI to establish Design for the World. The Icograda President's Award was presented to Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO for the organisation's long track-record in supporting Icograda's activities.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

===2000s===
At the 17th Icograda General Assembly a motion was ratified to hold a special millennium congress in October 2000 in Seoul, South Korea. The theme was ''Oullim'', meaning 'great harmony'. The event was attended by around 1,600 delegates and was also the first Icograda event to be webcast live on the Internet. The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.

In 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15–16 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.

In March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting. Smaller versions of the ''Design Perspectives'' seminar were also hosted in Victoria, Canada, as well as in Seattle, USA. The Icograda Design Week in Brno took place from 17–21 June in the Czech Republic. The event included ''Over the fence: Design in Central and Eastern Europe'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar, a Regional Meeting attended by delegates from eight countries, the ''Identity/Integrity Icograda Conference'', ''East Meets West, Icograda Student Workshop'', a symposium and inauguration of the Icograda Education Network (IEN) and a workshop to conceptualise the formation of the International Design Media Network (IDMN). The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.

In September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.

The year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.

In January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members’ interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.

The ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8–11 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003−2005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.

In January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey. The Week's programme included ''6 Alfabe, Icograda Student Workshop'', an IEN Symposium, Regional Meeting, ''Building Bridges: Icograda Design Conference'', ''Design Perspectives Icograda Regional Design Seminar'', as well as the launch of the Icograda Design Media Network (IDMN). This was followed by the Icograda Design Week in São Paulo, Brazil, in April of the same year. The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations’ Secretariates to Montreal.

In January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport – Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.

''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.

In 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks. In January, ''So Tiny, So Many: Icograda Design Week in Hong Kong'' took place in China and consisted of a student workshop, an evening lecture series and a Regional Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1025.htm |title=2006 - HONG KONG (CHINA) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, ''Defining design on a changing planet: Icograda Design Week in Seattle'', took place in the USA.

In [[medicine]], an '''indication''' is a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mw4.m-w.com/medical/indication |title=Indication - Medical Definition and More from Merriam-Webster |access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An indication can commonly be confused with the term diagnosis. A diagnosis is a particular [medical] condition while an indication is a reason for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolterskluwercdi.com/blog/what%E2%80%99s-value-drug-indication/|title=What’s the Value of the Drug Indication? {{!}} Clinical Drug Information|website=www.wolterskluwercdi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of an indication is a [[contraindication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mw4.m-w.com/medical/contraindication |title=Contraindication - Medical Definition and More from Merriam-Webster |access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits.

In the United States, medication indications are determined by the [[FDA]] and are grouped into either labeled indications, which are FDA-approved or off-label indications which are not approved. Currently in the US, including the indication or purpose of use for a drug is not required on prescription labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kron|first=Kevin|last2=Myers|first2=Sara|last3=Volk|first3=Lynn|last4=Nathan|first4=Aaron|last5=Neri|first5=Pamela|last6=Salazar|first6=Alejandra|last7=Amato|first7=Mary G.|last8=Wright|first8=Adam|last9=Karmiy|first9=Sam|date=2018-06-01|title=Incorporating medication indications into the prescribing process|url=http://www.ajhp.org/content/75/11/774|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|language=en|volume=75|issue=11|pages=774–783|doi=10.2146/ajhp170346|issn=1079-2082|pmid=29674327}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, manufacturers of [[Prescription drug|prescription drugs]] are required to include an "Indications and usage" section on the [[prescribing information]] or [[package insert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.57|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Drugs==
{{globalize|section|date=November 2017}}
Most countries and jurisdictions have a licensing body whose duty is to determine whether to approve a drug for a specific indication, based on the relative ''safety'' of the drug and its ''efficacy'' for the particular use. In the United States, indications for medications are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and are included in the [[package insert]] under the phrase "Indications and Usage".

In the United States there are label indications and off-label indications&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/indications_for_drugs__approved_vs_non-approved/views.htm|title=Indications for Drugs: Approved vs. Non-approved by MedicineNet.com|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Label indications:''

Medication that have label indications mean that they were approved by the FDA. This means that they are [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] for the indication and manufacturers are allowed to market their drug for the indication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A drug can have more than one FDA labeled indication, this means they can be used for multiple medical conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid26335981"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmasian H, Tran TH, Chase HS, Friedman C | title = Medication-indication knowledge bases: a systematic review and critical appraisal | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1261–70 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26335981 | pmc = 5009909 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocv129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the evidence and consensus for use of the drug increases and strengthens, its class of indication is improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68056687|title=Off-Label Use - MeSH Result|publisher=[[Medical Subject Headings]]|access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferred drugs (and other treatments) are also referred to a "[[Therapy|first line]]" or "primary" while others are called "second line", "third line" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/second-line+drug|title=second-line drug|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=346494|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drug may be indicated as an "adjunct" or "[[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]]", added to a first line drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=adjunct|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adjunct|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Off-label:''

Off-label indications are drugs that are used for medical indications that have not been approved by the FDA. Off label indications often have some clinical significance to back the use, but they have not gone through the extensive testing required by the FDA to have an official labeled indication. Drug companies can not provide any official medication information (e.g [[Medication package insert|package inserts]]) for off label indications. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== FDA approval ===
The purpose for adding FDA-approved indications in the United States is to ensure that healthcare providers can easily identify appropriate use of drug therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM612697.pdf|title=Indications and Usage Section of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products — Content and Format |website=fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining FDA approval is based on the body of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of a drug treatment. The scientific evidence is gathered in the first 3 steps in the drug development process: discovery and development, pre-clinical research (testing safety), and clinical research (testing efficacy)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/default.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After there is adequate completion of research and development phases by the drug companies, they send a [[New Drug Application|New Drug Application (NDA)]] for approval to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the proposed scientific evidence for use in an intended population is evaluated by a team of physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/default.htm |title=Development &amp; Approval Process (Drugs) | author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/newdrugapplicationnda/default.htm|title=New Drug Application (NDA) | author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research | website=www.fda.gov |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if it is found that there is substantial evidence that benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, the proposed labeling in the [[Medication package insert|package insert]] is appropriate, and the manufacturing process is safe and adequate, then the drug is approved to go to market under that now FDA-approved indication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/newdrugapplicationnda/default.htm|title=New Drug Application (NDA) | author =Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after approval, the FDA CDER continues to do postmarking surveillance of the drug through [[MedWatch]] and [[Adverse Event Reporting System|FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/surveillance/ucm090385.htm |title=Surveillance - Postmarketing Surveillance Programs | author =Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on Drug Pricing ===
Indications can impact pricing of medications through [[Value-based pricing|Value-based Pricing]], also known as indication specific pricing or indication value-based pricing.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Pearson SD, Dreitlein B, Henshall C. [https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Final-Report-2015-ICER-Policy-Summit-on-Indication-specific-Pricing-March-2016_revised-icons-002.pdf Indication-specific pricing of pharmaceuticals in the United States health care system: a report from the 2015 ICER Membership Policy Summit]. Boston: Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, March 2016. &lt;/ref&gt; Since drugs can be used for different indications, this form of pricing would set different prices for each indication based on the value the drug offers for whatever it is being used to treat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This pricing scheme is often discussed in relation to [[oncology]] drugs, which are costly and not always successful in treating patients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Oncology drugs can be used for multiple different types of cancers so by applying indication-specific pricing, the drug would be priced based on how effective it is for treating each type of cancer. If the drug is more effective for Cancer A than Cancer B, then the patient taking the drug to treat Cancer A will pay more than the person using it for Cancer B because they are getting more value out of it.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

Currently, most medications in the United States are priced the same regardless of what they're being used for or how effective they are at improving outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Companies like CVS and Express Scripts in the US have began implementing pricing based on indication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/5/indication-specific-drug-pricing-simple-theory-complex-reality|title=Indication-Specific Drug Pricing – Simple in Theory, Complex in Reality|date=2018-05-06|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in countries like Italy, similar forms of pricing are already being used.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Flume M, Bardou M, Capri S, Sola-Morales O, Cunningham D, Levin LA, Touchot N|date=January 2016|title=Feasibility and attractiveness of indication value-based pricing in key EU countries|url=|journal=Journal of Market Access &amp; Health Policy|volume=4|issue=1|pages=30970|doi=10.3402/jmahp.v4.30970|pmc=4864834|pmid=27226845|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Express Scripts' "Oncology Care Value Program," uses indication-based pricing for certain oncology medications and was launched in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/drug-options/safeguardrx-improves-affordability-and-access-to-budget-busting-drugs|title=SafeGuardRx Improves Affordability and Access to Budget-Busting Drugs {{!}} Express Scripts|website=lab.express-scripts.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy on the other hand, uses a model similar to indication-based pricing where the amount the hospital pays for certain drugs varies based on what it's used for.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patients can receive reimbursements for treatments based on their response and either be fully or partially refunded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Italy's reimbursement system is run by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, which is the national authority that regulates drugs in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/en/node/4111|title=The Italian Medicines Agency {{!}} AIFA Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco|website=www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Incorporating Indication of Use on Prescription Drug Labels ===
There has been some thought on incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels as an approach to improve patient understanding of the medications they are on. This information can help healthcare providers reduce medication errors related to drugs that may look and sound alike.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Knowing the indication of the drug can also help providers determine if the dose of the drug is appropriate per indication, and this can greatly improve patient safety and drug effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiff GD, Seoane-Vazquez E, Wright A | title = Incorporating Indications into Medication Ordering--Time to Enter the Age of Reason | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 375 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–9 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27464201 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp1603964 | url = https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1603964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are still some challenges with incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels. Revealing the indication of use on prescription drug labels can breach patient confidentiality since the label will disclose private information publicly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some medications can also be used for multiple diseases and one disease may have multiple medications for its prevention or treatment, therefore adding an indication on prescription labels in these cases may cause some confusion and may not be able to actually fit onto the label.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugtopics.com/latest/case-indications-prescriptions/page/0/1|title=The Case for Indications on Prescriptions |website=Drug Topics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Medical tests==
{{Further|Indications of medical tests}}
Each test has its own indications and contraindications, but in a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its ''net benefit'' for that individual, which largely depends on the absolute difference between [[pre- and post-test probability]] of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. Additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings.&lt;ref name="pmid12783911"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarvik JG, Hollingworth W, Martin B, Emerson SS, Gray DT, Overman S, Robinson D, Staiger T, Wessbecher F, Sullivan SD, Kreuter W, Deyo RA | title = Rapid magnetic resonance imaging vs radiographs for patients with low back pain: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Jama | volume = 289 | issue = 21 | pages = 2810–8 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12783911 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.21.2810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.

The '''Iroquoian languages''' are a language family of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]]. They are known for their general lack of [[labial consonant]]s.

Evidence is emerging that what has been called the ''[[Laurentian language|Laurentian]]'' language appears to be more than one dialect or language.{{cn|Ahmmmm=Such a statement ought be rooted in a source|date= November 2016}} Ethnographic and linguistic field work with the Wyandot tribal elders ([[#refBarbeau1960|Barbeau 1960]]) yielded enough documentation for scholars to characterize and classify the Huron and Petun languages.

The  languages of the tribes that constituted the tiny [[Wenrohronon]]{{efn 
 |Historical examination of the Jesuits records suggest ca 1640-42 the Wenro may have had as few as three villages sandwiched between Buffalo &amp; [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]] ([[Niagara River|Niagara]] and [[Genesee River]]s).&lt;ref name="AmHeritageBk"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1961 |encyclopedia=,|location= |id= |title=The American Heritage Book of Indians|author=Editor: Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., by The editors of American Heritage Magazine|editor=pages 188-219|publisher=American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc.|lccn=61-14871}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }}, the powerful Susquehannock and the confederations of the '''[[Neutral Nation]]''' and the '''[[Erie (tribe)|Erie Nation]]''' are very poorly documented.  They are historically grouped together, and geographically the Wenro's range on the eastern end of Lake Erie placed them between the two much larger confederations. To the east of the Wenro, beyond the [[Genesee Gorge]], were the lands of the Iroquois and southeast, beyond the headwaters of the [[Allegheny River]], lay the Susquehannocks.&lt;ref name="AmHeritageBk"/&gt;  The Susquehannocks and Erie were militarily powerful and respected by neighboring tribes.&lt;ref name="AmHeritageBk"/&gt; These groups were called ''Atiwandaronk,'' meaning 'they who understand the language' by the surviving Huron ([[Wyandot people]]). By 1660 all of these peoples but the Susquehannocks and Iroquois were defeated and scattered, migrating to form new tribes or to be adopted into others&amp;mdash;the practice of adopting valiant enemies into the tribe was a common cultural tradition of the Iroquoian peoples.&lt;ref name="AmHeritageBk"/&gt;

The group known as the [[Meherrin]] were neighbors to the Tuscarora and the Nottoway ([[#refBinford1967|Binford 1967]]) in the American South and may have spoken an Iroquoian language.  There is not enough data to determine this with certainty.

==External relationships==
Attempts to link the Iroquoian, [[Siouan languages|Siouan]], and [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan]] languages in a [[Macro-Siouan languages|Macro-Siouan]] family are suggestive but remain unproven ([[#refMithun1999|Mithun 1999]]:305).

'''Layering''' in linguistics refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalisation]] can be detected while it is taking place. The other four are: [[divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialisation]], [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]], and [[de-categorialization|de-categorialisation]].

Layering refers to the phenomenon that a language can have and develop multiple expressions for the same function, that language, in the "[[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]]" as well as in the "[[grammatical]]" domain, tolerates and permanently creates multiple [[synonymy]]. "Within a broad functional domain, new layers are continually emerging. As this happens, the older layers are not necessarily discarded, but may remain to coexist with and interact with the newer layers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Hopper|Hopper]] 1991: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of grammaticalisation, new layers are added to older ones whereby the functional domain is broadened, i.e. several items may fulfil the same linguistic function.

An example from English: 'I am going to study' / 'I will study' / 'I shall study'.

{{About|the 2012 documentary film|the 2015 video game|Life Is Strange}}
'''''Life Is Strange''''' is a 2012 American documentary film of interviews giving an [[oral history]] portrait of the life of pre-World War II European Jews by filmmaker Isaac Hertz. The film juxtaposes the childhood memories of interviewees with archival footage. Interviewees include Israeli president [[Shimon Peres]], author [[Uri Orlev]], academics, Nobel laureates, and friends of the filmmaker, [[Walter Kohn]], [[Robert J. Aumann]], Alain Jakubowicz, Sammy Grundwerg, Ron Samuels, Zachary Cirino, Chaim Hertz, Arianne Brown, Artem Zuev and Jean-Michel Guirao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/30/entertainment/la-et-mn-life-is-strange-capsule-20120831 |title=Review: An oddly effective 'Life Is Strange' |date=August 30, 2012 |first=Sheri |last=Linden |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/holocaust-oral-histories-are-shared-in-the-shapeless-life-is-strange-6440735 |title=Holocaust Oral Histories are Shared in the Shapeless ''Life Is Strange'' |first=Chris |last=Klimek |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a partial '''list of linguistic example sentences''' illustrating various [[Linguistics|linguistic]] phenomena.

{{Dynamic list}}
{{TOC right}}

== Ambiguity ==
Different types of ambiguity which are possible in language.

=== Lexical ambiguity ===
Demonstrations of words which have multiple meanings dependent on context.
* Will, will Will will Will Will's will? – Will (a person), will (future tense helping verb) Will (a second person) will (bequeath) {{bracket|to}} Will (a third person) Will's (the second person) will (a document)? (Someone asked Will&amp;nbsp;1 directly if Will&amp;nbsp;2 plans to bequeath his own will, the document, to Will&amp;nbsp;3.)&lt;ref name="Han 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Han |first=Bianca-Oana |date=2015 |title=On Language Peculiarities: when language evolves that much that speakers find it strange |url=http://upm.ro/cercetare/studia%20website/Studia18.2015.pdf#page=140 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014032026/http://upm.ro/cercetare/studia%20website/Studia18.2015.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2015 |dead-url=no |journal=Philologia |publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior |issue=18 |page=140 |location=Târgu Mureș, Romania |issn=1582-9960 |format=PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo]]. – Buffaloes from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], NY, whom buffaloes from Buffalo bully, bully buffaloes from Buffalo.
* Police police Police police police police Police police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last= Sterbenz|first= Christina|year= 2014|title= 9 Sentences That Are Perfectly Accurate|publisher= Business Insider Australia|url= https://www.businessinsider.com.au/weird-sentences-2014-1|accessdate= 10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Cops from [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]], Poland, whom cops from Poland patrol, patrol cops from Poland.
* Rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses. ([[Robert J. Baran]]) – Rose [a person] rose [stood] to put rose [pink-colored] roes [fish eggs as fertilizer] on her rows of roses [flower].
* [[James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/38/3802.pdf |title=Operator Jumble |issue=3802 |website=ACM-ICPC Live Archive |publisher=Baylor University |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309185345/http://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/38/3802.pdf |archive-date=9 March 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=10 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – With punctuation: "James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'. 'Had had' had had a better effect on the teacher", or James, while John had had 'had had', had had 'had'. 'Had had' had had a better effect on the teacher
* [[That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is]] – Grammatically corrected as: "That that is, is. That that is not, is not. Is that it? It is".
* Can can can can can can can can can can. – "Examples of the [[can-can]] dance that other examples of the same dance are able to outshine, or figuratively to put into the trashcan, are themselves able to outshine examples of the same dance". It could alternatively be interpreted as a question, "Is it possible for examples of the dance that have been outshone to outshine others?" or several other ways.
* If police police police police, who police police police? Police police police police police police.&lt;ref name="Gärtner 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gärtner |first=Hans-Martin |title=Generalized Transformations and Beyond: Reflections on Minimalist Syntax |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSGSzYc45xoC&amp;pg=PA58 |date=2002 |publisher=Akademie Verlag |isbn=978-3-05-003246-7 |page=58 |volume=46 |series=Studia Grammatica |issn=0081-6469}}&lt;/ref&gt; – If the ''police police'' is what you might call the people who supervise, monitor, and maintain order amongst the regular police force, then who, in turn, supervises the police police? The answer: the ''police police police''. Hyphenating the noun constructs makes this easier to follow. Therefore, "{{bracket|The}} police-police {{bracket|, that the}} police-police-police police {{bracket|, themselves}} police {{bracket|the}} police", which means that "the police-police, who are policed by the police-police-police, are themselves responsible for policing the regular police force". In these sentences, the word ''police'' is used both as a collective noun ("police force") and as a verb ("to police {{bracket|someone or something}}"). This clause is also a [[reduced relative clause]], so the word ''that'', which could appear between the second and third words of the sentence, is omitted.
* [[Martin Gardner]] offered the example: "Wouldn't the sentence 'I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign' have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and Chips, as well as after Chips?"&lt;ref name="Gardner 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Gardner |title=Aha!

=== Syntactic ambiguity ===
{{see|Syntactic ambiguity}}
Demonstrations of ambiguity between alternative syntactic structures underlying a sentence.
* We saw her duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/Exercises/semantics.soln.html |title=Solutions: Semantics |date=1 June 2010 |website=School of Computer Science and Engineering |publisher=University of New South Wales |location=Sydney, Australia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619203653/http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/Exercises/semantics.soln.html |archive-date=19 June 2012 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.&lt;ref name="Fodor Lepore 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fodor |first1=Jerry |last2=Lepore |first2=Ernie |date=2004 |title=Out of Context |journal=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=83–84 |issn=0065-972X |doi=10.2307/3219726 |jstor=3219726 |registration=yes |quote=[[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] said, as everybody knows, 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas.' This sets up the infamous joke: 'How an elephant got into my pajamas I can't imagine. {{bracket|Laughter}}.' What, exactly, happened here? We take the following to be untendentious as far as it goes: the conventions of English are in force, and they entail that there are two ways to read the set-up sentence. Either it expresses the thought (I, in my pajamas, shot an elephant) or it expresses the thought (I) (shot (an elephant in my pajamas)).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana]]

=== Syntactic ambiguity, incrementality, and local coherence ===
Demonstrations of how ''incremental'' and (at least partially) ''local'' syntactic parsing leads to infelicitous constructions and interpretations.
* [[Reduced relative clause]]s
** [[Garden path sentence|The horse raced past the barn fell]].
** The coach smiled at the player tossed the frisbee (by the opposing team).&lt;ref name="Tabor Galantucci Richardson 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tabor |first1=Whitney |last2=Galantucci |first2=Bruno |last3=Richardson |first3=Daniel |title=Effects of merely local syntactic coherence on sentence processing |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=50 |issue=4 |date=2004 |pages=355–370 |issn=0749-596X |doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.01.001 |url=//psychology.uconn.edu/labs/solab/papers/tabor04eomlscosp.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701150939/http://psychology.uconn.edu/labs/solab/papers/tabor04eomlscosp.pdf |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** While the man was hunting the deer ran through the forest.&lt;ref name="Christianson Hollingworth Halliwell Ferreira 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christianson |first1=Kiel |last2=Hollingworth |first2=Andrew |last3=Halliwell |first3=John F. |last4=Ferreira |first4=Fernanda |title=Thematic Roles Assigned along the Garden Path Linger |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=2001 |pages=368–407 |issn=0010-0285 |doi=10.1006/cogp.2001.0752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ambiguity and anaphora resolution ===
* [[Donkey sentence|Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.]]&lt;ref name="Barker 1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/teach/5386/donkey.html |title=CSI 5386: Donkey Sentence Discussion |last=Barker |first=Ken |date=2 October 1999 |website=University of Ottawa School of Information Technology and Engineering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516212356/http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/teach/5386/donkey.html |archive-date=16 May 2007 |dead-url=yes |quote='Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;: there is some single thing Y in the universe such that for every X in the universe if X is a farmer and Y is a donkey and X owns Y, then X beats Y. So the problem with the donkey sentence is that the scope of the variable corresponding to the donkey must be ''contained within the antecedent'' of the implication to prevent requiring the unconditional existence of the donkey. But the scope of the donkey variable must ''contain the consequent'' of the implication to allow the anaphoric reference! |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punctuation ===
Punctuation can be used to introduce ambiguity or misunderstandings where none needed to exist. One well known example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/m/a-midsummer-nights-dream/summary-and-analysis/act-v-scene-1 |title=CliffsNotes: A Midsummer Night's Dream |issue=3802 |website=CliffsNotes |publisher=CliffsNotes |dead-url=no |access-date=18 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for comedic effect, is from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by William Shakespeare (ignore the punctuation to get the alternate reading).

:Enter [[Peter Quince|QUINCE]] for the Prologue
:'''Prologue'''

::That you should think, we come not to offend,
::But with good will. To show our simple skill,

::We do not come as minding to contest you,
::Our true intent is. All for your delight

Unfortunately, the joke fails because it depends on a mistaken grammatical analysis: in ''I will not put up with this sort of English'' the sequence ''up with this sort of English'' is not a constituent, ''up'' being a separate complement of the verb (in the traditional analysis it is an adverb). Churchill's example thus does not demonstrate the absurdity of using [[prepositional phrase|PP]] fronting instead of stranding: it merely illustrates the ungrammaticality resulting from fronting something which is not a constituent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pullum 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001702.html |title=A Churchill story up with which I will no longer put |last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |author-link=Geoffrey K.

== Combinatorial complexity ==
Demonstrations of sentences which are unlikely to have ever been said, although the combinatorial complexity of the linguistic system makes them possible.
* [[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]] ([[Noam Chomsky]]): example that is grammatically correct but based on semantic combinations that are contradictory and therefore would not normally occur.
* Hold the news reader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.&lt;ref name="Fry 1989"&gt;{{cite episode |last=Fry |first=Stephen |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0526461/quotes?item=qt2070024 |series=A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie |network=BBC |date=20 January 1989 |title=Series&amp;nbsp;1, Episode&amp;nbsp;2 |quote=Hold the news reader's nose squarely waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semantics and context ==
Demonstrations of sentences where the semantic interpretation is bound to context or knowledge of the world.
* The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam: ambiguous use of a pronoun: The word "it" refers to the table being made of Styrofoam; but "it" refers to the large ball if we replace "Styrofoam" with "steel" without any other change in its syntactic parse.&lt;ref name="Etzioni 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Etzioni |first=Oren |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2630816|date=2014 |title=The battle for the future of data mining |journal=Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining|registration=yes|quote=The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bee landed on the flower because it had pollen: The pronoun "it" refers to the "flower" but changes to the "bee" if we replace "had" with "wanted".

=== Relevance conditionals ===
Conditionals where the prejacent ("if" clause) is not strictly required for the consequent to be true.
* There are biscuits on the table if you want some
* If I may be honest, you're not looking good&lt;ref name="Language Log"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1469 |title=Language Log}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* King [[Edward II]] of England was killed, reportedly after [[Adam Orleton|Adam of Orleton]], one of his gaolers, received a message, probably from Mortimer, reading "''{{lang|la|Edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est}}''". This can be read either as "''{{lang|la|Edwardum occidere nolite; timere bonum est}}''" ("Do not kill Edward; it is good to be afraid {{bracket|to do so}}") or as "''{{lang|la|Edwardum occidere nolite timere; bonum est}}''" ("Do not be afraid to kill Edward; {{bracket|to do so}} is good"). This ambiguous sentence has been much discussed by various writers, including [[John Harington (writer)|John Harington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collier |first=John Payne |author-link=John Payne Collier |date=1825 |chapter=Edward&amp;nbsp;II |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/aselectcollecti06collgoog#page/n406 |editor1-last=Reed |editor1-first=Isaac |editor1-link=Isaac Reed |editor2-last=Gilchrist |editor2-first=Octavius |editor2-link=Octavius Graham Gilchrist |title=A Selection of Old Plays in Twelve Volumes |volume=II |publisher=Septimus Prowett |location=London |page=393 |lccn=12002796 |oclc=2075486 |quote=Sir J.&amp;nbsp;Harington has an Epigram (L.&amp;nbsp;i.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;83.)

* Although at first glance the single character sentence [[:ja:子子子子子子子子子子子子|子子子子子子子子子子子子]] does not seem to make sense, when this sentence is read using the right readings of the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|子}} (but without the right meaning), it means "the young of cat, kitten, and the young of lion, cub". It is told in the work [[Ujishūi Monogatari]] that the Japanese poet [[Ono no Takamura]] used this reading to [[Ono no Takamura#Takamura in later literature|escape death]].

* ''{{lang|cs|Jedli na hoře bez holí}}'', meaning either "they ate [[elderberries]] on a mountain using a stick" or "they ate on a mountain without any sticks" or "they ate elderberry using a stick to eat their sorrow away"; depending on the phrasing or a correct placement or punctuation, at least 7 meanings can be obtained. Replacing "na hoře" by "nahoře", one obtains 5 more meanings. If separating words using spaces is also permitted, the total number of known possible meanings rises to 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ja.kub.cz/index.php?id=detail&amp;idk=71 |publisher=Sbírka kalambůrů Jakuba Těšínského |title=Registrační záznam kalambůru č. 71 |date=31 July 2010 |access-date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Gyeongsang dialect]], the repetition of the syllable {{lang|ko|가}} ("ga") with the right intonation can form meaningful phrases. For example:

** "{{lang|ko|가가 가가가}}" which means "Since they took it away"
** "{{lang|ko|가가 가가가?}}" which means "Are they the one with the surname Ga?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rigvedawiki.net/%EA%B0%80%EA%B0%80%20%EA%B0%80%EA%B0%80 |title=가가 가가 |date=26 February 2015 |website=[[Rigveda Wiki|리그베다 위키]] |language=ko |trans-title=Gaga Gaga |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010201814/http://rigvedawiki.net/%EA%B0%80%EA%B0%80%20%EA%B0%80%EA%B0%80 |archive-date=10 October 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=10 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A famous example for lexical ambiguity is the following sentence: "''{{lang|de|Wenn hinter Fliegen Fliegen fliegen, fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach.}}''", meaning "When flies fly behind flies, then flies fly in pursuit of flies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yourdailygerman.com/2016/12/09/crazy-german-sentence-structure/ |title=German is easy: "Lord of the Flies" |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo#Siehe_auch |title=German Wikipedia article on the "Buffalo" sentence |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} It takes advantage of some German nouns and corresponding verbs being homonymous. While not noticeable in spoken language, in written language the difference shows: "Fliegen" ("flies"), being a noun, is written with a capital "F", whereas "fliegen" ("to fly"), being a verb, is not. The comma can be left out without changing the meaning. There are several variations of this sentence pattern, although they do not work as smoothly as the original.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1277">In [[economics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''normative statement''' expresses a value judgment about whether a situation is desirable or undesirable.

The '''Phonetics Laboratory''' is the [[phonetics]] laboratory at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. It is located at 41 [[Wellington Square, Oxford]].

The laboratory focusses on experimental tests of linguistic assumptions and empirical linguistics.  It provides teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Research students in the laboratory are normally reading for a higher degree in Experimental Linguistics, though students from other disciplines touching on the subject of speech are sometimes based in Phonetics.

The Phonetics Laboratory was established in 1980. It occupies the basement of 41 Wellington Square, a mid-Victorian brick building, expanded since.  It has experimental areas (sound-insulated recording booths), and general experimental space.  The lab also supports signal processing research via software, speech corpora, and processor clusters.

==Working Papers==
The Phonetics Lab has published collections of working papers (ongoing research and research getting ready for peer-reviewed publication) since 1996.   The 2009 Working Papers are titled "Papers in Phonetics and Computational Linguistics."

==Founding and leadership==
The group was founded in 1994 as '''English Language Advocates'''.&lt;ref name="Ziegler-McPherson"&gt;Christina Ziegler-McPherson, "English Only Groups" in ''Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (Vol. 1: ed. Kathleen R. Arnold: Greenwood, 2011), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;, by [[John Tanton]], M.D., a Petoskey, Michigan eye surgeon and a leading figure in the national immigration reform movement, along with three former board members of [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]] who had resigned to protest that organization’s decision not to defend an Arizona official English law it had sponsored.&lt;ref name="Salomone"&gt;Rosemary C. Salomone, ''True American'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2010), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanton co-founded US English in 1983 with U.S. Senator [[S.I. Hayakawa]] of California, but had resigned from it earlier following the disclosure of a joke deemed racially insensitive in an internal memo he had written).&lt;ref name="SPLCAug2015"/&gt; The organization is part of Tanton's broader "loose-knit" network of anti-immigration organizations; others include [[Californians for Population Stabilization]], the [[Center for Immigration Studies]], [[NumbersUSA]], and [[Social Contract Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/john-tantons-network Jonh Tanton's Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309060821/https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/john-tantons-network |date=2017-03-09 }}, ''Intelligence Report'', [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015{{When|date=October 2018}}, ProEnglish "is one of the few remaining groups in Tanton's network in which he remains actively involved."&lt;ref name="SPLCAug2015"/&gt; ProEnglish is a project of '''US Inc.''', a Petoskey, Michigan-based 501(c)(3) group that is also part of the Tanton network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinc.org/about-us/ About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620203734/https://usinc.org/about-us/ |date=2018-06-20 }}, US Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

ProEnglish has also worked for the adoption of official English laws at the local level, most notably in [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://judiciary.house.gov/_files/hearings/Hearings%202012/Porter%2008022012.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727074113/https://judiciary.house.gov/_files/hearings/Hearings%202012/Porter%2008022012.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ProEnglish vocally opposed the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|comprehensive immigration reform bill]] sponsored by the "[[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]]," a bipartisan group of U.S. senators. ProEnglish carried out a radio ad campaign against U.S. Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], who was part of the Gang of Eight.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

In 2014, ProEnglish criticized [[The Coca-Cola Company]] for airing a [[Super Bowl commercials|Super Bowl commercial]] that showed people of different ethnicities singing "[[America, the Beautiful]]" in a variety of languages. ProEnglish condemned Coca-Cola (saying the ad fostered "disunity") and urged its supporters to contact the company to express opposition.&lt;ref name="Segal"/&gt;

===Litigation history===
In 2005, ProEnglish was helping pay the legal fees of at least two employers who had an "English-only rule" requiring employees to speak only English while on the job.&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt; ProEnglish paid the legal fees of Terri Bennett, a former nursing student at [[Pima Community College]] (PCC) in [[Tucson, Arizona]], "who claimed she was wrongly suspended for complaining when fellow students spoke Spanish to one another in class."&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"&gt;Carol Ann Alaimo, [http://tucson.com/news/local/education/ex-student-who-sued-pima-college-must-pay-k/article_5f157fed-024d-59da-9731-6e0476dcffe1.html Ex-student who sued Pima College must pay $111K] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017232059/http://tucson.com/news/local/education/ex-student-who-sued-pima-college-must-pay-k/article_5f157fed-024d-59da-9731-6e0476dcffe1.html |date=2015-10-17 }}, ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' (October 15, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alaimo2013"/&gt; At trial, the evidence showed that Bennett had called [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] classmates "spics, beaners and illegals" and the [[Spanish language]] "gibberish."&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"/&gt; A jury unanimously rejected the Bennett's claims, and in 2015 ordered her to pay $111,000 in attorney's fees to PCC.&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"/&gt;

In 2008, ProEnglish, along with the [[Pacific Legal Foundation]], filed a lawsuit in [[United States federal court|federal court]] challenging 2004 [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Service]] regulations that required federally funded healthcare providers to provide translation services for patients who do not speak English. The challengers claimed that the regulations were an "illegal intrusion" on healthcare providers. U.S. District Judge [[Barry Ted Moskowitz]] dismissed the suit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00028586/ Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Filed by ProEnglish Over HHS Guidelines on Translation Services for Patients] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223447/http://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00028586/ |date=2017-03-08 }}, Kaiser Health News (June 11, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''EEOC v. Kidmans'' (2005), ProEnglish helped fund the litigation costs of a small [[drive-in restaurant]] in [[Page, Arizona]], that was sued by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] after it refused to retract an English-on-the-job rule. The restaurant said that the rule was adopted to stop "trash talking" in the [[Navajo language]] among employees, most of whom are [[Navajo people|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/05/01/343415/ Fighting Words How a tiny drive-in restaurant in Arizona became the center of a bitter battle over English-only rules in the workplace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201045327/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/05/01/343415/ |date=2017-12-01 }}, CNN Money (May 1, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The EEOC and the restaurant owners ultimately negotiated a settlement, in which the employees "may require employees to speak English while dealing with the public, but not at other times."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Barron, [https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/2910 Not just freedom fries at this English-only drive-in?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620181101/https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/2910 |date=2018-06-20 }}, ''The Web of Language'' (November 23, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Structured English Immersion==
ProEnglish opposes the method of teaching English language learning (ELL) students that teaches them basic courses in their native language while they learn English, known as ‘bilingual education,’ as a failed 40-year experiment. Instead, it favors the method known as ‘structured English immersion,’ in which ELLs are taught in English while being given supplemental learning assistance on the side.

Accordingly, it backed successful citizen initiative that ended bilingual education programs in California (1998), Arizona (2000), and Massachusetts (2002), as well as one unsuccessful such citizen’s initiative in Colorado (2002).  ProEnglish Chair Dr. Rosalie Porter co-chaired the English for the Children initiative in Massachusetts that passed with 68 percent of the vote. Much research comparing students in bilingual programs to students in structured English immersion consistently shows far better results in English immersion classes. {{cite book |last= Imhoff|first= Gary|date= 1990|title= Learning In Two Languages|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}

==Repealing Executive Order 13166==
[[Executive Order 13166]], also known as “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” states that any entity receiving federal funds must provide translations or interpreters for the services it provides in the language spoken by persons likely to use those services. It states that failure to do so is likely to constitute “discrimination on the basis of national origin” as prohibited by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights law.
	
An [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on August 11, 2000, the order directed all federal agencies to draft plans to “improve access to federally conducted or federally assisted programs for persons who, as a result of national origin, are limited in their English proficiency.” The mandate also applies to all state and local government agencies and their subdivisions, and government contractors that receive federal funds.&lt;ref name="Maceri"/&gt;

The most usual meaning is in reference to instruction manuals, and means "Read the F'ing Book" more politely rendered as "Read the Fine Book."

'''"RTFB"''' is a [[parody|parodical]] extension to the [[Internet slang]] term "[[RTFM]]" and its extension "RTFS".

"RTFB" is short for "read the fucking binary", in a similar way as "RTFM" means "read the fucking manual" and "RTFS" means "read the fucking source". While both "RTFM" and "RTFS" have legitimate uses, "RTFB" is usually intended only as a parody of them. While any user, no matter how tech-savvy, can be expected to read the [[Owners manual|manual]], and experienced [[computer programmer]]s can deduce the working logic of a [[computer program]] directly from reading its human-readable [[source code]], "RTFB" expects users to directly read the [[machine language]] code that the [[microprocessor]] executes natively. Today's microprocessors are usually so complex that, except for trivial textbook programs, this is a difficult task even for experienced programmers, and because of anti-[[reverse-engineering]] laws, may even be illegal.

RTFB has also been used meaning "Read the fucking [[Bible]]" in relation to WWJD ([[What would Jesus do?|What Would Jesus Do]]) jokes.

A more recent use, applied to members of the legislative branch, means "read the fucking bill". It is a reaction to the practice of passing massive legislation where the final bill is available for only a few hours before it is voted upon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31002">'''Referring expression generation''' ('''REG''') is the subtask of [[natural language generation]] (NLG) that received most scholarly attention. While NLG is concerned with the conversion of non-linguistic information into natural language, '''REG''' focuses only on the creation of [[referring expression]]s (noun phrases) that identify specific entities called ''targets''.

This task can be split into two sections. The ''content selection'' part determines which set of properties distinguish the intended target and the ''linguistic realization'' part defines how these properties are translated into natural language.
A variety of algorithms have been developed in the NLG community to generate different types of referring expressions.

==Types of referring expressions==
A [[referring expression]] (RE), in linguistics, is any [[noun phrase]], or surrogate for a noun phrase, whose function in discourse is to ''identify'' some individual object (thing, being, event...) The [[technical terminology]] for ''identify'' differs a great deal from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably ''refer'', and a thing identified is a ''referent'', as for example in the work of [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]]. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to [[pragmatics]], the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to understand the nature of [[knowledge]], [[perception]] and [[cognition]] more generally.

Various devices can be used for reference: [[determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[proper name]]s... Reference relations can be of different kinds; referents can be in a "real" or imaginary world, in discourse itself, and they may be singular, plural, or collective.

===Pronouns===
The simplest type of referring expressions are [[pronouns|pronoun]] such as ''he'' and ''it''.  The linguistics and natural language processing communities have developed various models for predicting anaphor referents, such as centering theory,&lt;ref name="Poesio et al."&gt;M Poesio, R Stevenson, B di Eugenio, J Hitzeman (2004). Centering: A Parametric Theory and Its Instantiations.  ''Computational Linguistics'' 30:309-363 [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J04-3003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and ideally referring-expression generation would be based on such models.  However most NLG systems use much simpler algorithms, for example using a pronoun if the referent was mentioned in the previous sentence (or sentential clause), and no other entity of the same gender was mentioned in this sentence.

===Definite noun phrases===
There has been a considerable amount of research on generating definite noun phrases, such as ''the big red book''.  Much of this builds on the model proposed by Dale and Reiter.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; This has been extended in various ways, for example Krahmer ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Erk,Verleg"&gt;E Krahmer, S van Erk, A Verleg (2003).  Graph-Based Generation of Referring Expressions. Computational Linguistics 23:53-72 [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J03-1003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; present a graph-theoretic model of definite NP generation with many nice properties.  In recent years a shared-task event has compared different algorithms for definite NP generation, using the TUNA&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/corpus-496.php]&lt;/ref&gt; corpus.

===Spatial and temporal reference===
Recently there has been more research on generating referring expressions for time and space.  Such references tend to be imprecise (what is the exact meaning of ''tonight''?), and also to be interpreted in different ways by different people.&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter, S Sripada, J Hunter, J Yu, and I Davy (2005). Choosing Words in Computer-Generated Weather Forecasts. ''Artificial Intelligence'' 167:137-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence it may be necessary to explicitly reason about false positive vs false negative tradeoffs, and even calculate the utility of different possible referring expressions in a particular task context.&lt;ref name="Turner et al."&gt;R Turner, Y Sripada, E Reiter (2009) Generating Approximate Geographic Descriptions. ''Proceedings of the 12th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG)'', pages 42–49, Athens. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0607.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for good expressions===
Ideally, a good referring expression should satisfy a number of criteria:
* ''Referential success'': It should unambiguously identify the referent to the reader.
* ''Ease of comprehension'': The reader should be able to quickly read and understand it.
* ''Computational complexity'': The generation algorithm should be fast
* ''No false inferences'': The expression should not confuse or mislead the reader by suggesting false [[implicature]]s or other pragmatic inferences.  For example, a reader may be confused if he is told ''Sit by the brown wooden table'' in a context where there is only one table.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"&gt;R Dale, E Reiter (1995). Computational interpretations of the Gricean maxims in the generation of referring expressions. ''Cognitive Science'', 18:233–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-2000 era===
REG goes back to the early days of NLG. One of the first approaches was done by Winograd&lt;ref&gt;T Winograd (1972). Understanding Natural Language. ''Academic Press'', New York. Section 8.3.3, Naming Objects and Events&lt;/ref&gt; in 1972 who developed an "[[incremental algorithm|incremental]]" REG algorithm for his [[SHRDLU]] program. Afterwards researchers started to model the human abilities to create referring expressions in the 1980s. This new approach to the topic was influenced by the researchers Appelt and Kronfeld who created the programs KAMP and BERTRAND&lt;ref name="Appelt"&gt;D Appelt (1985). Planning English referring expressions. ''Artificial Intelligence'', 26:1–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelt&amp;Kronfeld"&gt;D Appelt, A Kronfeld (1987). A computational model of referring. ''In Proceedings of the 10th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)'', pages 640–647, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Kronfeld (1990). Reference and Computation: An Essay in Applied Philosophy of Language. ''Cambridge University Press'', Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and considered referring expressions as parts of bigger speech acts.

Some of their most interesting findings were the fact that referring expressions can be used to add information beyond the identification of the referent&lt;ref name="Appelt&amp;Kronfeld" /&gt; as well as the influence of communicative context and the [[Gricean maxim]]s on referring expressions.&lt;ref name="Appelt" /&gt; Furthermore, its skepticism concerning the naturalness of minimal descriptions made Appelt and Kronfeld's research a foundation of later work on REG.

The search for simple, well-defined problems changed the direction of research in the early 1990s. This new approach was led by Dale and Reiter who stressed the identification of the referent as the central goal.&lt;ref name="Dale1989"&gt;R Dale (1989). Cooking up referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 68–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dale1992"&gt;R Dale (1992). Generating Referring Expressions: Constructing Descriptions in a Domain of Objects and Processes. ''TheMIT Press'', Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter (1990). The computational complexity of avoiding conversational implicatures. ''In Proceedings of the 28th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 97–104, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter, R Dale (1992). A fast algorithm for the generation of referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)'', pages 232–238, Nantes.&lt;/ref&gt;
Like Appelt&lt;ref name="Appelt" /&gt; they discuss the connection between the [[Gricean maxim]]s and referring expressions in their culminant paper&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; in which they also propose a formal [[#Problem definition|problem definition]]. Furthermore, Reiter and Dale discuss the [[#Full Brevity|Full Brevity]] and [[#Greedy Heuristics|Greedy Heuristics]] algorithms as well as their [[#Incremental Algorithm|Incremental Algorithm]](IA) which became one of the most important algorithms in REG.

===Later developments===
After 2000 the research began to lift some of the simplifying assumptions, that had been made in early REG research in order to create more simple algorithms. Different research groups concentrated on different limitations creating several expanded algorithms. Often these extend the IA in a single perspective for example in relation to:

Generating referring expressions: Making referents easy to identity. ''Computational Linguistics'', 33:229–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many simplifying assumptions are still in place or have just begun to be worked on. Also a combination of the different extensions has yet to be done and is called a "non-trivial enterprise" by Krahmer and van Deemter.&lt;ref name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter"&gt;E Krahmer, K van Deemter (2012). Computational Generation of Referring Expressions: A Survey. ''Computational Linguistics'' 38:173-218 [https://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J12/J12-1006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important change after 2000 was the increasing use of [[#Evaluation of REG systems|empirical studies]] in order to evaluate algorithms. This development took place due to the emergence of transparent [[#Corpus-based Evaluation|corpora]]. Although there are still discussions about what the best evaluation metrics are, the use of experimental evaluation has already led to a better comparability of algorithms, a discussion about the goals of REG and more task-oriented research.

Furthermore, research has extended its range to related topics such as the choice of ''[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Knowledge Representation]](KR) Frameworks''. In this area the main question, which KR framework is most suitable for the use in REG remains open. The answer to this question depends on how well descriptions can be expressed or found. A lot of the potential of KR frameworks has been left unused so far.

Some of the different approaches are the usage of:

* ''[[Graph search]]'' which treats relations between targets in the same way as properties.&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Erk,Verleg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Viethen&amp;Dale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Goudbeek,Theune"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Krahmer, M Theune, J Viethen, I Hendrickx (2008).

&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

==Problem definition==
Dale and Reiter (1995) think about referring expressions as distinguishing descriptions.

They define:
* The ''referent'' as the entity that should be described
* The ''context set'' as set of salient entities
* The ''contrast set'' or ''potential distractors'' as all elements of the context set except the referent
* A ''property'' as a reference to a single [[attribute-value pair]]
Each entity in the domain can be characterised as a set of [[attribute-value pair]]s for example &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;type, dog&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;gender, female&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;age, 10 years&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The problem then is defined as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be the intended referent, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the contrast set. Then, a set &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of attribute–value pairs will represent a distinguishing description if the following two conditions hold:
# Every attribute–value pair in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; applies to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: that is, every element of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; specifies an attribute–value that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; possesses.
# For every member &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, there is at least one element &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that does not apply to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:  that is, there is an &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that specifies an attribute–value that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; does not  possess. &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is said to rule out &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, to generate a referring expression one is looking for a set of properties that apply to the referent but not to the distractors.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter" /&gt;

The problem could be easily solved by conjoining all the properties of the referent which often leads to long descriptions violating the second [[Gricean maxim#Maxim of Quantity|Gricean Maxim of Quantity]]. Another approach would be to find the shortest distinguishing description like the [[#Full Brevity|Full Brevity algorithm]] does.
Yet in practice it is most common to instead include the condition that referring expressions produced by an algorithm should be as similar to human-produced ones as possible although this is often not explicitly mentioned.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

==Basic algorithms==

===Full Brevity===
The Full Brevity algorithm always finds a minimal distinguishing description meaning there is no shorter distinguishing description in regard to properties used.

Therefore, it iterates over &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,4,...&lt;/math&gt; and checks every description of a length of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; properties until a distinguishing description is found.

Two problems arise from this way of creating referring expressions. Firstly the algorithm has a high complexity meaning it is [[NP-hard]] which makes it impractical to use.&lt;ref&gt;M R Garey, D S. Johnson (1979). ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP–Completeness''. W. H. Freeman, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly human speakers produce descriptions that are not minimal in many situations.&lt;ref&gt;D R Olson (1970). Language and thought: Aspects of a cognitive theory of semantics. ''Psychological Review'', 77:257–273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Sonnenschein (1984). The effect of redundant communication on listeners: Why different types may have different effects. ''Journal of Psycholinguistic Research'', 13:147–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Pechmann (1989). Incremental speech production and referential overspecification. ''Linguistics'', 27:98–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P E Engelhardt, K G.D Bailey, F Ferreira (2006). Do speakers and listeners observe the Gricean Maxim of Quantity?. ''Journal of Memory and Language'', 54:554–573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Greedy Heuristics===
The Greedy Heuristics algorithm&lt;ref name="Dale1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dale1992"/&gt; approximates the Full Brevity algorithm by iteratively adding the most distinguishing property to the description. The most distinguishing property means the property that rules out most of the remaining distractors. The Greedy Heuristics algorithm is more efficient than the Full Brevity algorithm.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

Dale and Reiter(1995)&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; present the following algorithm for the Greedy Heuristic:

Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the set of properties to be realised in our description; let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the set of properties known to be true of our intended referent &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (we assume that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty); and let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the set of distractors (the contrast set). The initial conditions are thus as follows:
 &lt;math&gt;C = \{ \langle &lt;/math&gt;all distractors&lt;math&gt;\rangle \}&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;math&gt;P = \{ \langle &lt;/math&gt;all properties true of &lt;math&gt;r\rangle \}&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;math&gt;L = \{\}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to describe the intended referent &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the contrast set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, we do the
following:
 1. Check Success:
    '''if''' &lt;math&gt;|C| = 0&lt;/math&gt; '''then''' return &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as a distinguishing description
    '''elseif''' &lt;math&gt;P = \empty&lt;/math&gt; '''then''' fail
    '''else''' '''goto''' Step 2.
 2. Choose Property:
    '''for each''' &lt;math&gt;p_i \in P&lt;/math&gt; '''do''': &lt;math&gt;C_i \leftarrow C \cap \{x|p_i(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
    Chosen property is &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest set.
    '''goto''' Step 3.
 3. Extend Description (wrt the chosen &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;):
    &lt;math&gt;L \leftarrow L \cup \{p_j\}&lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt;C \leftarrow C_j&lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt;P \leftarrow P - \{p_j\}&lt;/math&gt;
    '''goto''' Step 1.

===Incremental Algorithm===
The Incremental Algorithm (IA) by Dale and Reiter&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; was the most influential algorithm before 2000. It is based on the idea of a ''preferential'' order of attributes or properties that speakers go by. So in order to run the Incremental Algorithm, first a preference order of attributes has to be given. Now the algorithm follows that order and adds those properties to the description which rule out any remaining distractors. Furthermore, Dale and Reiter&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; stress the attribute type which is always included in their descriptions even if it does not rule out any distractors.

Also the type values are part of a ''subsumption hierarchy'' including some ''basic level values''. For example, in the ''pet'' domain ''chihuahua'' is subsumed by ''dog'' and ''dog'' by ''animal''. Because ''dog'' is defined as a basic level ''dog'' would be preferred by the algorithms, if ''chihuahua'' does not rule out any distractors.

The Incremental Algorithm is easy to implement and also computationally efficient running in [[polynomial time]]. The description generated by the IA can contain redundant properties that are superfluous because of later added properties. The creators do not consider this as a weakness, but rather as making the expressions less "psycholinguistically implausible".&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter" /&gt;

The following algorithm is a simplified version of Dale and Reiter’s Incremental Algorithm&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; by Krahmer and van Deemter&lt;ref name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter"/&gt; that takes as input the referent ''r'', the ''D'' containing a collection of domain objects and a domain-specific ordered list ''Pref'' of preferred attributes. In the notation ''L'' is the description, ''C'' the context set of distractors and the function RulesOut({{angbr|A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, V}}) returns the set of objects which have a value different to V for attribute A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Evaluation of REG systems==
Before 2000 evaluation of REG systems has been of theoretical nature like the one done by Dale and Reiter.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; More recently, empirical studies have become popular which are mostly based on the assumption that the generated expressions should be similar to human-produced ones. [[Corpus linguistics|Corpus]]-based evaluation began quite late in REG due to a lack of suitable data sets. Still corpus-based evaluation is the most dominant method at the moment though there is also evaluation by human judgement.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Corpus-based evaluation===
First the distinction between [[text corpora]] and experimental corpora has to be made. [[Text corpora]] like the GNOME corpus&lt;ref name="Poesio et al."/&gt; can contain texts from all kind of domains. In REG they are used to evaluate the ''realization'' part of algorithms. The ''content selection'' part of REG on the other hand requires a corpus that contains the properties of all domain objects as well as the properties used in references. Typically those fully "semantically transparent"&lt;ref&gt;K van Deemter, I van der Sluis, A Gatt (2006). Building a semantically transparent corpus for the generation of referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 130–132, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; created in experiments using simple and controlled settings.

These experimental corpora once again can be separated into ''General-Purpose Corpora'' that were collected for another purpose but have been analysed for referring expressions and ''Dedicated Corpora'' that focus specifically on referring expressions. Examples of General-Purpose Corpora are the Pear Stories,&lt;ref&gt;W W Chafe (1980). ''The Pear Stories: Cognitive, Cultural, and Linguistic Aspects of Narrative Production.'' Ablex, Norwood, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; the Map Task corpus&lt;ref&gt;A A Anderson, M Bader, E Gurman Bard, E Boyle, G Doherty, S Garrod, S Isard, J Kowtko, J McAllister, J Miller, C Sotillo, H Thompson, R Weinert (1991). The HCRC map task corpus. ''Language and Speech'', 34:351–366.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Coconut corpus&lt;ref&gt;B Di Eugenio, P W Jordan, R H Thomason, J D Moore (2000). The agreement process: an empirical investigation of human–human computer-mediated collaborative dialogs. ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'', 53:1017–1076.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bishop corpus,&lt;ref&gt;P Gorniak, D Roy (2004). Grounded semantic composition for visual scenes. ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research'', 21:429–470.&lt;/ref&gt; the Drawer corpus&lt;ref&gt;J Viethen, R Dale (2006). Algorithms for generating referring expressions: Do they do what people do?. ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 63–70, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; and the TUNA corpus&lt;ref name="Gatt Sluis Deemter"&gt;A Gatt, I van der Sluis, K van Deemter (2007). Evaluating algorithms for the generation of referring expressions using a balanced corpus. ''Proceedings of the 11th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG)'', pages 49–56, Schloss Dagstuhl.&lt;/ref&gt; count to the Dedicated Corpora. 
The TUNA corpus which contains web-collected data on the two domains furniture and people has been used in three shared REG challenges already.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Evaluation metrics===
To measure the correspondence between corpora and the results of REG algorithms several Metrics have been developed.

To measure the ''content selection'' part the [[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Dice coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;L R Dice (1945). Measures of the amount of ecologic association between species. ''Ecology'', 26:297–302.&lt;/ref&gt; or the MASI (Measuring Agreement on Set-valued Items)&lt;ref&gt;R Passonneau (2006). Measuring agreement on set-valued items (MASI) for semantic and pragmatic annotation. ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)'', pages 831–836, Genoa.&lt;/ref&gt; metric are used. These measure the overlap of properties in two descriptions. In an evaluation the scores are usually averaged over references made by different human participants in the corpus. Also sometimes a measure called Perfect Recall Percentage (PRP)&lt;ref name="Gatt Sluis Deemter"/&gt; or Accuracy&lt;ref&gt;A Gatt, A Belz, E Kow (2008). The TUNA challenge 2008: Overview and evaluation results. ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 198–206, Salt Fork, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; is used which calculates the percentage of perfect matches between an algorithm-produced and a human-produced reference.

For the ''linguistic realization'' part of REG the overlap between strings has been measured using metrics like [[BLEU]]&lt;ref&gt;K Papineni, S Roukos, T Ward, W Zhu (2002). BLEU: A method for automatic evaluation of machine translation. ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 311–318, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[NIST (metric)|NIST]].&lt;ref&gt;G Doddington (2002). Automatic evaluation of machine translation quality using n-gram co-occurrence statistics. ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Human Language Technology Research (HLT)'', pages 138–145, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem that occurs with string-based metrics is that for example "The small monkey" is measured closer to "The small donkey" than to "The little monkey".

A more time consuming way to evaluate REG algorithms is by letting humans judge the ''Adequacy'' (How clear is the description?) and ''Fluency'' (Is the description given in good and clear English?) of the generated expression. Also Belz and Gatt&lt;ref&gt;A Belz, A Gatt (2008). Intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation measures for referring expression generation. ''Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', Columbus, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated referring expressions using an experimental setup. The participants get a generated description and then have to click on the target. Here the extrinsic metrics reading time, identification time and error rate could be evaluated.

'''Rongowhakaata''' "'''Rongo'''" '''Pere Halbert''' (2 February 1894 – 11 April 1973) was a [[Māori people|Māori]] tribal leader, interpreter, historian and [[genealogist]]. He was considered "an eminent authority on Māori literature".&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt; Halbert's book ''Horouta: The History of the Horouta Canoe, Gisborne and East Coast'', published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1999, is considered a classic of tribal history.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt;

==Early life==
Halbert was born on 2 February 1894 in Waerenga-a-Hika, [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], to Hetekia Te Kani Pere (or Halbert), a farmer, and his wife, Riripeti Rangikohera Ranginui. His grandfather was noted Māori politician [[Wi Pere]]. Halbert attended school in Gisborne up until 1911. He then attended [[Nelson College]] from 1911 to 1914, where he was a [[prefect]] and excelled at sports and music.&lt;ref name="dnzb"/&gt;

On 11 September 1915, he married Patehepa Tamatea and together they had seven children. For a time they ran a dairy farm at Pukepapa, near Waituhi.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

==Career==

Halbert became a licensed interpreter in 1915.&lt;ref name="pbh-interpeting"/&gt; His strong command of the [[Māori language]] combined with his knowledge of Māori literature gained him important roles such as assisting the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] with Māori place names, and revising the sixth edition of H. W. Williams's Māori dictionary. Later he acted as an adviser on Māori texts for the [[Polynesian Society]]. Halbert was a founding member of the Gisborne Art Gallery and Museum in 1955, and the first chairman of the Maori Museum Committee, advising on the Māori collections.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

As a historian and genealogist, Halbert contributed to John Hikawera Mitchell's ''Takitimu'' (1944), a record of the migration of the [[Ngati Kahungunu]].&lt;ref name="takitimu"/&gt; He also contributed to the Whakatane and District Historical Society's first memoir, ''Te Tini o Toi'', as well as papers on the dating of Maori genealogies.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

From 1940 onwards Halbert devoted most of his time to studying the history and genealogy of the East Coast [[iwi]].&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt; In 1999 his book ''Horouta: The History of the Horouta Canoe, Gisborne and East Coast'' was posthumously published by [[Reed Publishing]].&lt;ref name="Beattie" /&gt;

Poor health forced Halbert's retirement from the Maori Purposes Fund Board in 1968. He died at Lavington Private Hospital in [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], Auckland on 11 April 1973 and was buried at Taruheru Cemetery in Gisborne. He was survived by three daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Halbert was preparing a major historical and genealogical work. He left three main collections of papers: a manuscript called 'Horouta', 130 complete [[whakapapa]] charts, and a series of maps and historical data with iwi and [[hapū]].&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

The '''Rosetta Project''' is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to develop a contemporary version of the historic [[Rosetta Stone]] to last from 2000 to [[Timeline of the far future#Technology and culture|12,000]] AD; it is run by the [[Long Now Foundation]]. Its goal is a meaningful survey and near permanent archive of 1,500 [[language]]s. Some of these languages have fewer than one thousand speakers left. Others are considered to be dying out because government centralization and [[globalization]] are increasing the prevalence of [[English language|English]] and other major languages. The intention is to create a unique platform for [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research and education, as well as a functional linguistic tool that might help in the recovery or revitalisation of lost languages in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/2012-03-24/3903626 The Rosetta Project], Presented by Maria Zijlstra on Lingua Franca, 24 March 2012, ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/02011/03/07/dr-laura-welcher-the-rosetta-project-the-language-commons/ Dr. Laura Welcher – The Rosetta Project &amp; The Language Commons], March 7th, 2011, by Austin Brown, Blog of the Long Now&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is creating this broad language archive through an open contribution, open review process similar to the strategy that created the original ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.  The resulting archive will be publicly available in three different media: a [[HD-Rosetta]] micro-etched [[nickel]] [[alloy]] disc three inches (7.62 cm) across with a 2,000 year life expectancy; a single volume monumental reference book; and a growing online archive. &lt;!-- I thought the metal was going to be [[Monel]]; did they change it, or did whoever write this not know the name/that we have an article on it? --&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:World population spoken languages.svg|thumb|200px|Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages (in red) are predicted to disappear in the next century]]

Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages are predicted to disappear in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Much linguistic description, especially the description of languages with few speakers, remains hidden in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic diversity, the Long Now Foundation plans a broad online survey and near-permanent physical archive of 1,500 of the approximately 7,000 human languages.

The project has three overlapping goals:

# to create an unprecedented platform for comparative linguistic research and education
# to develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that might help with the recovery of lost or compromised languages in unknown futures
# to offer an aesthetic object that suggests the immense diversity of human languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this diversity

The 1,500-language [[corpus linguistics | corpus]] expands on the parallel-text structure of the original Rosetta Stone through archiving ten descriptive components for each of the 1,500 selected languages.

The goal is an [[Open-source software|open source]] "[[Linux]] of [[Linguistics]]"—an effort of collaborative online scholarship drawing on the expertise and contributions of thousands of academic specialists and native speakers around the world. The project is also organising formal archive research groups at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], the American [[Library of Congress]], and the American [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (and its offices in [[Dallas]]).

The resulting Rosetta archives are publicly available in three different media:

# a free and continually growing online archive, also available as a DVD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/interactive/ |website=Rosettaproject.org |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a single-volume monumental reference book;{{cn|date=June 2018}}
# an extreme-longevity micro-etched disc.

A "Version 1.0" of the [[HD-Rosetta]] disc was completed on November 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/2008/11/03/macro-to-micro-etching/ Macro to micro etching], November 3rd, 2008, by Alexander Rose, The Long Now Foundation's Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The disc contains over 13,000 pages of information using over 1,500 languages,&lt;ref name="weardisk"/&gt; which can be read after magnifying by 650 times with a microscope.

In early 2017, the Rosetta Wearable Disk was released.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=This Necklace Contains All of the World’s Languages |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/necklace-contains-all-worlds-languages-180961876/ |website=Smithsonian.com (Smart News) |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed using a similar manufacturing process as the first edition of the Rosetta Disk, the main difference being that the final archive is about 2 cm in diameter, thus enabling wearing as an ornament on the human body. One side has instructions in eight different languages and scripts (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian), and the other an archive of over 1000 human languages assembled in 2016. By November 2017, the initial run of 100 disks had all been sold, but new releases are planned.&lt;ref name="weardisk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosetta Wearable Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/wearable/ |website=The Rosetta Project: A Long Now Foundation Library of Human Language |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay |title=Philatelic Terms Illustrated, 4th edition |publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]] |year=2003 |location=London |pages=26 |isbn=0-85259-557-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the stamp shows two denominations separated by a plus sign, but in many cases the only [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]] shown is for the postage rate, and the postal customer simply pays the higher price when purchasing the stamps.

==The first semi-postals==
The first semi-postal was actually a [[Postcard|postal card]]; to commemorate the [[Uniform Penny Post]] in 1890, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] issued a card with a face value of one penny, but sold it for sixpence, with the difference given to a fund for postal workers. The first semi-postal stamps were issued by the Australian colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], who both marked the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of Queen Victoria in 1897 with stamps denominated in pennies, but sold for shillings, a 12x increase over the face value.

==Twentieth century issues==
[[File:Stamp NZ 1945 health.jpg|upright|thumb|A 1945 New Zealand "Health" stamp charging 2 pence for postage and a premium of 1 penny for charity.]]
Semi-postals became widespread in European countries at the beginning of the 20th century. In many cases they have become standard annual issues, such as the [[Pro Juventute]] series of [[Switzerland]] started in 1913.  Many countries issued semi-postal stamps to raise money for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] in [[World War I]]. The surcharges are typically a fraction of the face value; at one point the [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] was officially boycotting stamps with surcharges greater than 50 per cent of face value, saying that such issues were exploitive of [[stamp collecting|stamp collectors]]. The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] [[Royal Mail]], a relative newcomer to semi-postals, issued its first stamp of this type in 1975 with a 4½p denomination and a premium of 1½p for charitable causes making the total cost 6p, with funds going to health and handicap charities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The stamp issue was not considered a success and there have been few UK semi-postal issues since.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some non-European countries followed suit (such as [[New Zealand]], which has issued [[health stamp]]s annually since 1929); the New Zealand associated territories of the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] often issue Christmas or Easter stamps in two sets of values, with one set having a charitable surcharge. But semi-postal stamps are still predominantly European. By contrast, the [[United States]] is a newcomer to semi-postals, with its first semi-postal being the [[Breast cancer research stamp]] issued in July 1998.  Through 2016 four additional stamps were issued, three for other causes and the fourth a reissue of the Breast cancer stamp.  A subsequent law allowed five more stamps to be issued at two year intervals over the next decade.  The first, for [[Alzheimer's disease]], was released in November, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Postal Service to Issue Semipostal Stamps |publisher=[[United States Postal Service|USPS]] |date=2 October 2017 |url=https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2017/pr17_057.htm |accessdate=2 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-postal issues are not always issued on a regular basis for health and similar causes; they have been on occasion issued as a means of raising funds for disaster relief. These are usually sold as charity stamps, though occasionally, as with the 1971 refugee relief stamps of [[India]], the excess cost has been levied as an obligatory tax. One of the highest value semi-postal stamps is the [[Falkland islands]]' "rebuilding fund" stamp, issued in 1982 after the Anglo-Argentinian war over the islands. This was aimed primarily at collectors, and had a postal value of £1 with an added £1 surcharge.

Charitable disaster relief stamps are commonly found in smaller island nations as a result of natural disasters, as in the case of [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]' 1980 hurricane relief issues, and [[Tonga]]'s 1982 cyclone relief stamp. In these cases, existing issues are often used, [[overprint]]ed with text indicating the reason for the surcharge.

The Harvard Semitic Museum was founded in 1889, and moved into its present location at 6 Divinity Avenue in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in 1903.

From the beginning, it was the home of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, a departmental library, a repository for research collections, a public educational institute, and a center for archaeological exploration. Among the museum's early achievements were the first scientific excavations in [[the Holy Land]] (at [[Samaria]] in 1907–1912) and excavations at [[Nuzi]] and Tell el-Khaleifeh in the [[Sinai]], where the earliest alphabet was found.

The museum's artifacts include [[pottery]], [[cylinder seal]]s, [[sculpture]], [[coin]]s, [[clay tablet|cuneiform tablet]]s, and Egyptian [[mummy]] [[sarcophagi]]. Many are from museum-sponsored excavations in [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Israel]], and [[Tunisia]].  The museum holds plaster casts of the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], the [[Laws of Hammurabi]], and the [[Victory stele of Esarhaddon|Stele of Esarhaddon]], as well as a full-scale model of an [[Iron Age]] [[Israelite]] house.  The museum is dedicated to the use of these collections for the teaching, research, and publication of Near Eastern archaeology, history, and culture. 

==History==
Architectural firm A. W. Longfellow broke ground on the present Harvard Semitic Museum site on September 27, 1900.  Construction was completed in spring of 1902, and the public portions of the museum were opened on February 5, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weissman|first=Ann Waymire|title=Governance and the Academic Museum: A Case History of the Semitic Museum|year=2012|publisher=Harvard Extension School|location=Cambridge, MA|page=22|type=Thesis|chapter=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The museum's facilities were repurposed during World War II, and it was closed to the public from August 1942 through April 1946. Twelve years later it was closed again to the public, lasting from 1958 through 1982.  

The museum reopened in April 1982, and then Harvard President Derek Bok spoke at the reopening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weissman|first=Ann Waymire|title=Governance and the Academic Museum: A Case History of the Semitic Museum|year=2012|publisher=Harvard Extension School|location=Cambridge, MA|page=50|type=Thesis|chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Harvard announced a new consortium, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, whose members are the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]], the Harvard Semitic Museum, the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]], and the [[Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments]].

==Functions==
===Exhibition and education===
The Semitic Museum, through the collaborative efforts of departmental faculty, curators, museum curatorial staff, and students; mounts exhibits, often in conjunction with university courses, which not only serve the university community, but also attract the general public. The museum has an active public outreach program featuring tours for school groups and teacher training workshops. The museum also sponsors, either alone or in conjunction with other institutions, a number of public lectures each year. Through these educational efforts, the museum seeks to promote a wider understanding of the civilizations of the Near East and their great cultural legacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Semitic Museum|title=About|url=http://www.semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k66717&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup105529|work=Semitic Museum Website|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching with the collection===
There are many opportunities for Harvard University students and faculty to make use of the museum collections and facilities.  Objects can be used for coursework, viewing assignments, research papers, senior theses, dissertations, and teaching displays.  The basement seminar room is available for sections scheduled to view the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Semitic Museum|title=About|url=http://www.semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k66717&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup105529|work=Semitic Museum Website|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard] College|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and publication===
The Harvard Semitic Museum sponsors archaeological field research into the complex societies of the Near East, with special emphasis on those ancient cultures related to the world of the Bible. Each year more than 100 staff, students, and volunteers participate in the Ashkelon Excavations (The Leon Levy Expedition), led by Honorary Museum Director Lawrence E. Stager, Dr. Daniel M. Master, and Dr. Adam Aja. The museum, through its Harvard Semitic Series and Harvard Semitic Monographs, publishes archaeological, historical, philological, and cultural studies of the Near East, many of which present the research of the department faculty and their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Semitic Museum|title=About|url=http://www.semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k66717&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup105529|work=Semitic Museum Website|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38954">'''Specific language impairment''' ('''SLI''') is diagnosed when a child's language does not develop normally and the difficulties cannot be accounted for by generally slow development, physical abnormality of the speech apparatus, [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[apraxia]], acquired brain damage or [[hearing loss]]. [[Twin study|Twin studies]] have shown that it is under [[Heredity|genetic]] influence. Although language impairment can result from a single-gene mutation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lai, C. S., Fisher, S. E., Hurst, J. A., Vargha-Khadem, F., &amp; Monaco, A. P.|first=|year=2001|title=A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder|url=http://www.nature.com.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/nature/journal/v413/n6855/abs/413519a0.html|journal=Nature|volume=413 |issue=6855|pages=519–523|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is unusual. More commonly SLI results from the combined influence of multiple genetic variants, each of which is found in the general population, as well as environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=D. V. M|date=2002-07-01|title=The role of genes in the etiology of specific language impairment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021992402000874|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=35|issue=4|pages=311–328|doi=10.1016/S0021-9924(02)00087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Specific language impairment (SLI) is diagnosed when a child has delayed or disordered language development for no apparent reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D ; Norbury, C. F. |chapter=Speech and language impairments |editors=Anita Thapar; Sir Michael Rutter; Bishop, Dorothy ; Daniel Pine; Scott, Steven M.; Jim Stevenson; Taylor, Eric; Eds |title=Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2008 |pages=782–801 |isbn=1-4051-4549-8 |oclc=473789535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the first indication of SLI is that the child is later than usual in starting to speak and subsequently is delayed in putting words together to form sentences. [[Spoken language]] may be immature. In many children with SLI, understanding of [[language]], or ''receptive'' language, is also impaired, though this may not be obvious unless the child is given a formal assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. |title=Uncommon understanding: development and disorders of language comprehension in children |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-86377-260-9 |oclc=776282908 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although difficulties with use and understanding of complex sentences are a common feature of SLI, the diagnostic criteria encompass a wide range of problems, and for some children other aspects of language are problematic (see below). In general, the term SLI is reserved for children whose language difficulties persist into school age, and so it would not be applied to toddlers who are late to start talking, most of whom catch up with their peer group after a late start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donna J. Thal |author2=Jeanette Katich | chapter=Predicaments in early identification of specific language impairment : does the early bird always catch the worm? | title=Assessment of Communication and Language (Communication and Language Intervention Series) |editors=Donna J. Thal; Kevin N. Cole; Dale, Philip S. | publisher=Brookes Publishing Company |location= |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |isbn=1-55766-193-6 |oclc=34772171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The terminology for children's language disorders is extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings. In part this confusion reflects uncertainty about the boundaries of SLI, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms "developmental dysphasia" or "developmental aphasia" were used to describe children with the clinical picture of SLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ingram TT, Reid JF |title=Developmental aphasia observed in a department of child psychiatry |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=31 |issue=157 |pages=161–72 |date=June 1956 |pmid=13328151 |pmc=2011959 |doi= 10.1136/adc.31.157.161|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired [[aphasia]]. This is misleading, as SLI is not caused by brain damage.

Some synonyms currently in use for specific language impairment are language impairment, developmental language delay (DLD), language disorder, and language-learning disability. Researcher [[Bonnie Brinton]] argues that the term "specific language impairment" is misleading because the disorder does not only affect language, but also affects reading, writing, and social/pragmatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujiki|first=Martin|last2=Spackman|first2=Matthew P.|last3=Brinton|first3=Bonnie|last4=Hall|first4=Andrea|date=2004-06-01|title=The Relationship of Language and Emotion Regulation Skills to Reticence in Children With Specific Language Impairment|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781463|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=637–646|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/049)|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In medical circles, terms such as ''specific developmental language disorder'' are often used, but this has the disadvantage of being wordy, and is also rejected by some people who think SLI should not be seen as a "disorder". In the [[Education in the United Kingdom|UK educational system]], ''speech, language and communication needs'' (SLCN) is currently the term of choice, but this is far broader than SLI, and includes children with speech and language difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.

===Subtypes (Rapin and Allen 1987)===
Although most experts agree that children with SLI are quite variable, there is little agreement on how best to subtype them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. V. M |chapter=Specific language impairment: diagnostic dilemma |editors=Hans Van Balkom; Verhoeven, Ludo Th |title=Classification of developmental language disorders: theoretical issues and clinical implications |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2004 |pages= 309–326 |isbn=1-4106-0902-2 |oclc=53721852}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted classification system. In 1983 [[Isabelle Rapin|Rapin]] and Allen&lt;ref&gt;Rapin, I., &amp; Allen, D. (1983). Developmental language disorders: nosologic considerations. In U. Kirk (Ed.), Neuropsychology of language, reading, and spelling (pp. 155–184). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a classification of developmental language disorders based on the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] features of language impairment, which was subsequently updated by Rapin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rapin I |title=Practitioner review: developmental language disorders: a clinical update |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=643–55 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8894945 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that Rapin is a child neurologist, and she refers to different subtypes as "syndromes"; many of those coming from the perspective of education or [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language therapy]] reject this kind of medical label, and argue that there is not a clear dividing line between SLI and normal variation.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, P. S., &amp; Cole, K. N. (1991). What's normal? Specific language impairment in an individual differences perspective. Language, Speech and Hearing Services in Schools, 22, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although most experts would agree that children with characteristics of the Rapin subtypes can be identified, there are many cases who are less easy to categorise, and there is also evidence that categorisation can change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Classification of children with specific language impairment: longitudinal considerations |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1195–204 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10515515 |doi= 10.1044/jslhr.4205.1195|url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/5/1195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapin's subgroups fall into three broad categories:

====Receptive/expressive developmental language disorder====
Receptive/expressive phonologic/syntactic deficit syndrome is the most common form of SLI, in which the child's most obvious problems are a tendency to speak in short, simplified sentences, with omission of some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features, such as past tense -ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leonard, Laurence B. |title=Children with specific language impairment |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-585-27859-8 |oclc=45728290 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common also to see simplified [[speech production]] when the child is young. For instance, clusters of [[consonant]]s may be reduced, so that "string" is pronounced as "ting". Vocabulary is often limited, with a tendency to use "general all-purpose" terms, rather than more specific words.&lt;ref name="RiceBode1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=M. L.|last2=Bode|first2=J. V.|title=GAPS in the verb lexicons of children with specific language impairment|journal=First Language|volume=13|issue=37|year=1993|pages=113–131 |issn=0142-7237 |doi=10.1177/014272379301303707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonard LB |title=Is expressive language disorder an accurate diagnostic category? |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=115–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19029534 |pmc=2718760 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/08-0064) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Auditory verbal agnosia|Verbal auditory agnosia]] is a very rare form of language impairment, in which the child appears unable to make sense of speech sounds. It typically occurs as a symptom of [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], in which case a diagnosis of SLI would not be appropriate, as there is a known neurological origin of the language difficulties.

====Expressive developmental language disorder syndromes====
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)]]￼￼ – in the child with DVD, comprehension is adequate; the onset of speech is very delayed and extremely limited with impaired production of speech sounds and short utterances. The poor speech production cannot be explained in terms of structural or neurological damage of the [[Speech organ|articulators]]. There is much disagreement about diagnostic criteria, but the label most often used for children whose intelligibility declines markedly when they attempt complex utterances, compared to when they are producing individual sounds or [[syllable]]s.

Another key feature is inconsistency of speech sound production from one occasion to another.  Although the term "[[Developmental coordination disorder|dyspraxia]]" suggests a pure output disorder,&lt;ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Non-specific nature of specific language impairment: a review of the literature with regard to concomitant motor impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11344592 |doi= 10.1080/13682820010019874|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many – perhaps all – of these children have difficulty in doing tasks that involve mentally manipulating speech sounds, such as [[phonological awareness]] tasks. Children with DVD also typically have major literacy problems, and [[receptive language]] levels may be poor on tests of [[vocabulary]] and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wells, Bill |author2=Stackhouse, Joy |title=Children's speech and literacy difficulties: a psycholinguistic framework |publisher=Singular Pub. Group |location=San Diego, Calif |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=1-86156-030-3 |oclc=246491090 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonologic programming deficit syndrome – the child speaks in long but poorly intelligible utterances, producing what sounds like [[neologism|jargon]]. Outside Rapin's group, little has been written about this subtype, which is not generally recognised in diagnostic frameworks.

====Higher order processing disorders====
Lexical deficit disorder – the child has word finding problems and difficulty putting ideas into words. There is poor comprehension for connected speech. Again, there is little research on this subtype, which is not widely recognised.

[[Pragmatic language impairment]] – the child speaks in fluent and well-formed utterances with adequate articulation; content of language is unusual; comprehension may be over-literal and language use is odd. The child may chatter incessantly and be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic. There has been a great deal of controversy about this category, which is termed ''pragmatic language impairment (PLI)'' in the UK. Debate has centred over the question of whether it is a subtype of SLI, part of the autistic spectrum, or a separate condition.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2000). Pragmatic language impairment: a correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum? In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In DSM-5, the term ''Social Communication Disorder'' has been introduced; this is equivalent to PLI.

===Relationship with other neurodevelopmental disorders===
Although textbooks draw clear boundaries between different neurodevelopmental disorders, there is much debate about overlaps between them.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D., &amp; Rutter, M. (2008). Neurodevelopmental disorders: conceptual approaches. In M. Rutter, D. Bishop, D. Pine, S. Scott, J. Stevenson, E. Taylor &amp; A. Thapar (Eds.), Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (pp. 32–41). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Many children with SLI meet diagnostic criteria for [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Snowling MJ |title=Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different? |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=858–86 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15535741 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.858 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have features of [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2008). Specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism: Using genetics to unravel their relationship. In C. F. Norbury, J. B. Tomblin &amp; D. V. M. Bishop (Eds.), Understanding developmental language disorders: from theory to practice (pp. 67–78). Hove: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
SLI is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test for SLI. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of SLI:
*The child has language difficulties that interfere with daily life or academic progress
*Other causes are excluded: the problems cannot be explained in terms of hearing loss, general developmental delay, [[autism]], or physical difficulty in speaking
*Performance on a standardized language test (see assessment, below) is significantly below age level
There is considerable variation in how this last criterion is implemented. Tombin et al. (1996) proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Zhang X |title=A system for the diagnosis of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1284–94 |date=December 1996 |pmid=8959613 |doi= 10.1044/jshr.3906.1284|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Assessment will usually include an interview with the child's caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language and nonverbal ability. There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by [[Speech-Language Pathology#National approaches to speech and language pathology|speech and language professionals]] (therapists or SALTs in the UK, speech-language pathologists, SLPs, in the US and Australia).
A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of SLI is the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation.

The Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test is a quick (ten minute) simple and accurate screening test developed and standardized in the UK. It is suitable for children from 3;4 to 6;8 years;months and can be administered by professionals and non-professionals (including parents) alike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gardner H, Froud K, McClelland A, van der Lely HK |title=Development of the Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test to assess key markers of specific language and literacy difficulties in young children |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=513–40 |year=2006 |pmid=17050469 |doi=10.1080/13682820500442644 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been demonstrated to be highly accurate (98% accuracy) in identifying impaired children who need specialist help vs non-impaired children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Lely HK, Payne E, McClelland A |title=An investigation to validate the grammar and phonology screening (GAPS) test to identify children with specific language impairment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e22432 |year=2011 |pmid=21829461 |pmc=3145645 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022432 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it potentially a feasible test for widespread screening.

The Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2) is a parent questionnaire suitable for testing language skills in school-aged children.
Informal assessments, such as language samples, may also be used. This procedure is useful when the normative sample of a given test is inappropriate for a given child, for instance, if the child is bilingual and the sample was of monolingual children. It is also an ecologically valid measure of all aspects of language (e.g. semantics, syntax, pragmatics, etc.).

To complete a language sample, the SLP will spend about 15 minutes talking with the child. The sample may be of a conversation (Hadley, 1998), or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, the SLP will tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. ''Frog Where Are You?'', Mayer, 1969), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back.

Language samples are typically transcribed using computer software such as the systematic analysis of language software (SALT, Miller et al. 2012), and then analyzed. For example, the SLP might look for whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.

==Prevalence==
Epidemiological surveys, in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Buckwalter P, Zhang X, Smith E, O'Brien M |title=Prevalence of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1245–60 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9430746 |doi= 10.1044/jslhr.4006.1245|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson CJ, Beitchman JH, Young A, etal |title=Fourteen-year follow-up of children with and without speech/language impairments: speech/language stability and outcomes |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=744–60 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10391637 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the prevalence of SLI in five-year-olds at around 7%. However, neither study adopted the stringent "discrepancy" criteria of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] or [[ICD-10]]; SLI was diagnosed if the child scored below cut-off on standardized language tests, but had a nonverbal IQ of 90 or above and no other exclusionary criteria.

==Developmental course and outcome==
Longitudinal studies indicate that problems are largely resolved by five years in around 40% of 4-year-olds with SLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Edmundson A |title=Language-impaired 4-year-olds: distinguishing transient from persistent impairment |journal=J Speech Hear Disord |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=156–73 |date=May 1987 |pmid=3573746 |doi= 10.1044/jshd.5202.156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry low levels of literacy are common, even for children who receive specialist help,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Fey ME, Tomblin JB, Zhang X |title=A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments |journal=J.

Res. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1142–57 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12546484 |doi= 10.1044/1092-4388(2002/093)|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educational attainments are typically poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Adams JW, Bishop DV, Stothard SE |title=Educational attainments of school leavers with a preschool history of speech-language impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=173–83 |year=2001 |pmid=11344593 |doi= 10.1080/13682820120976|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkin|first1=Z.|last2=Conti-Ramsden|first2=G.|title=Evidence of reading difficulty in subgroups of children with specific language impairment|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=22|issue=3|year=2006|pages=315–331|issn=0265-6590|doi=10.1191/0265659006ct310xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the nonverbal IQ of children with SLI decreases over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Botting, N |title=Non-verbal cognitive development and language impairment |journal= Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=317–326 |date=March 2004 |pmid= 15755307|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00355.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SLI is associated with a high rate of [[psychiatric disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Nancy |title=Language impairment and psychopathology in infants, children, and adolescents |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7619-2025-0 |oclc=45749780 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2004) found that 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with SLI scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Social difficulties and victimization in children with SLI at 11 years of age |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=145–61 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15072535 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/013) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with SLI find elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clegg J, Hollis C, Mawhood L, Rutter M |title=Developmental language disorders—a follow-up in later adult life.

Better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Bishop DV, Stothard SE, Chipchase B, Kaplan C |title=Psychosocial outcomes at 15 years of children with a preschool history of speech-language impairment |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=759–65 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16898989 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01631.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic and environmental risks==
It is now generally accepted that SLI is a strongly [[genetic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV |title=What Causes Specific Language Impairment in Children? |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=217–221 |date=October 2006 |pmid=19009045 |pmc=2582396 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence comes from studies of twins. Two [[twins]] growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, seen almost exclusively in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability.

There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of SLI in identical twins, indicating that environmental factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with SLI who has an identical twin with normal language.

SLI is not usually caused by a [[mutation]] in a single gene.  Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and SLI results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2009). Genes, cognition and communication: insights from neurodevelopmental disorders. The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156, 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized, however, that a mutation of the FOXP2 gene may have an influence on the development on SLI to a certain degree, as it regulates genes pertinent to neural pathways related to language.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Bishop, D. (2009). Genes, Cognition, and Communication: Insights from Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156(1), 1–18. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04419.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of non-genetic factors have been found selectively to impact on [[language development]] in children. Later-born children in large families are at greater risk than earlier born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garside, Roger F. |author2=Fundudis, Trian |author3=Kolvin, Israel |title=Speech retarded and deaf children : their psychological development |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-12-270150-X |oclc=6308388 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, genetic mutation, hereditary influences, and environmental factors may all have a role in the development and manifestation of SLI.  It is important, therefore, to not associate the development to a single factor, but recognize that it is oftentimes the result of complex interactions between any or all of these factors.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

==Causal theories==
Much research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children.  A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ceponiene R, Cummings A, Wulfeck B, Ballantyne A, Townsend J |title=Spectral vs. temporal auditory processing in specific language impairment: a developmental ERP study |journal=Brain Lang |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=107–20 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19457549 |pmc=2731814 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.04.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tallal P |title=Improving language and literacy is a matter of time |journal=Nat.

==Associated factors==
Males are more affected by SLI than females. In clinical samples, the sex ratio of affected males: females is around 3 or 4:1.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. J. (1991). Causes and associations of severe and persistent specific speech and language disorders in children. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 33, 943–962.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this association is not known: no linkage has been found to [[genes]] on the [[sex chromosomes]].
Poor [[motor skills]] are commonly found in children with SLI.&lt;ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71"/&gt; [[Brain scans]] do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with SLI, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of [[White matter|white]] or [[grey matter]] in specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jernigan TL, Hesselink JR, Sowell E, Tallal PA |title=Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=539–45 |date=May 1991 |pmid=2021369 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.1991.00530170103028|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, unusual brain [[gyri]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson T, Plante E |title=Gyral morphology in the posterior Sylvian region in families affected by developmental language disorder |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=81–94 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8976499 |doi= 10.1007/bf01875369|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no consistent "neural signature" for SLI has been found.

==Intervention==
Intervention is usually carried out by speech and language therapists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning. In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using [[imitation]] and [[data collection|elicitation]] methods, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] toward [[Social Interaction Approach|interventions]] that develop children's social use of [[language]], often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, T. (1996). Social-interactional approaches to child language intervention. In J. Beitchman, N. J. Cohen, M. M. Konstantareas &amp; R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behavior Disorders: Developmental, Biological and Clinical Perspectives (pp. 493–514). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which modern approaches to remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, particularly with preschool children.&lt;ref&gt;Tannock, R., &amp; Girolametto, L. (1992). Reassessing parent-focused intervention programs. In S. F. Warren &amp; J. Reichle (Eds.), Causes and effects in communication and language intervention (pp. 49–81). Baltimore MD: Paul Brooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

A radically different approach has been developed by [[Paula Tallal|Tallal]] and colleagues, who have devised a computer-based intervention, [[Fast Forword]], that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P. (2000). Experimental studies of language learning impairments: From research to remediation. In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 131–155). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory underlying this approach maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity.

For all these types of intervention, there are few adequately controlled trials that allow one to assess clinical efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Law J, Garrett Z, Nye C |title=The efficacy of treatment for children with developmental speech and language delay/disorder: a meta-analysis |journal=J.

A '''spotface''' or '''spot face''' is a [[machining|machined]] feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is [[facing (machining)|faced]], providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces [[casting|cast]] or [[forging|forged]], where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]], and location are subject to wider [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of '''spotfacing''' ('''spot facing''') is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow [[counterbore]], just deep enough "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a [[boss (engineering)|boss]], creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, without the need for finishing all over (FAO). 

The cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are [[counterbore]] cutters and [[endmill]]s. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in [[numerical control|CNC]] machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs [[milling cutter#Face mill |face mills]]. 

'''Backspotfacing''' ('''back spot facing''') is analogous to backboring, meaning that the tool manages to reach to the far side of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with [[boring bar]]s reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut (for example, in the [[G-code#G76_bore_on_mill|G76 fine boring cycle]]), or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion. Such back-cutting operations can obviate second operations,&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Hider |editor-first=Julia |date=2018-03-15 |title=Back-spotfacing tool frees production from costly bottlenecks |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=https://www.mmsonline.com/blog/post/back-spotfacing-tool-frees-production-from-costly-bottlenecks |accessdate=2018-03-16 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their attendant setup time and part rehandling time. Sometimes the limiting factor in applying this advantage is the difficulty of [[swarf|chip]] clearance; the operator needs to intervene because chip nests prevent the tool from passing freely and opening and closing freely.&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; In such cases, improved chipbreaking via different [[tipped tool|inserts]] in the main operation may help, and backspotfacing tools powered by [[cutting fluid|coolant pressure]] and using through-tool coolant feed may succeed where others cannot (opening, cutting, and retracting despite some chips),&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; not only obviating a second operation but also making the main operation less reliant on operator intervention and program stops ([[G-code#M00|M00 or M01]]) than a lesser backspotfacing tool would.&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; 

Some fastener designs can obviate spotfacing for some applications. For example, a [[self-aligning nut]] allows the nut to find its own perpendicularity to the thread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup arrangement). 

[[Technical standard|Standards]] exist for the sizes of spotfaces, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between [[standards organization]]s. For example, in [[Boeing]] Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spot-faced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the [[ASME]] Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">The '''Starfish Project''' is a [[UK]]-based [[non-profit|not-for-profit]] therapy programme which helps people who [[stuttering|stammer]] or [[stuttering|stutter]] to overcome their speech  through the use of [[diaphragmatic breathing]] (also known as ''costal breathing'').  The programme also teaches participants to reassess negative emotions surrounding their stammering through the use of avoidance reduction therapy (see [[stuttering therapy]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/about-starfish-project.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Participants attend a three-day residential course near [[Hailsham]] in the UK during which a diaphragmatic breathing technique and non-avoidance strategies are taught. Following this initial course, participants are able to attend additional follow-up courses at the same venue without charge from the Starfish Project as often as they feel necessary.  Course participants are also encouraged to make use of a list of phone contacts of other course participants and can attend free support meetings at various locations around the UK. 

Anne Blight, founder of the Starfish Project, has been working with people who stammer for many years, first as a volunteer with the Association for Stammerers in the UK, then with its successor organisation The British Stammering Association. Anne Blight was previously involved in the early days of [[McGuire Programme]] before founding the Starfish Project in 1998.

In 2016, the Starfish Project announced its first courses outside of the UK. The Starfish Project had been invited to start courses for people who stammer in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC) countries. Courses are scheduled quarterly in [[Dubai]] with instruction in English and monthly at various cities within the GCC countries with instruction in Arabic.  

Although diaphragmatic breathing may be an effective way for people who stammer to manage their condition, it should not be regarded as a cure and, while anecdotally effective, the existence of beneficial outcomes for people who stammer from diaphragmatic breathing-based therapies such as the Starfish Project is not supported by specific peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/what-the-papers-say.htm] and [http://www.starfishproject.co.uk/what-the-papers-say-more.htm] for a selection of third-party newspaper and magazine clippings.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar breathing technique is used by several other stammering treatment initiatives including the programme offered by the [[Del Ferro Institute]] in [[Amsterdam]] (where the application of diaphragmatic breathing to stammering was first developed) and the [[McGuire Programme]].

In [[library and information science]] [[document]]s (such as books, articles and pictures) are classified and searched by '''subject''' – as well as by other attributes such as author, genre and document type. This makes "subject" a fundamental term in this field. Library and information specialists assign subject labels to documents to make them [[findable]]. There are many ways to do this and in general there is not always consensus about which subject should be assigned to a given document.&lt;ref&gt;This is, for example, measured by so-called inter-indexer consistency studies. See: Saracevic, T. (2008). Effects of inconsistent relevance judgments on information retrieval test results: A historical perspective. Library Trends, 56(4), 763–783. http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~tefko/LibraryTrends2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To optimize subject indexing and searching, we need to have a deeper understanding of what a subject is. The question: "what is to be understood by the statement 'document A belongs to subject category X'?" has been debated in the field for more than 100 years (see [[#Theoretical views|below]]).

==Definition==

Hjørland defined subjects as the ''epistemological potentials of documents''. This definition is in line with the request oriented understanding of indexing quoted below. The idea is that a document is assigned a subject to ease retrieval and findability. And the criteria for what should be found – what constitutes knowledge – is in the end an epistemological question.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (1992). The Concept of "Subject" in Information Science. Journal of Documentation, 48(2), 172–200. http://www.iva.dk/bh/core%20concepts%20in%20lis/1992JDOC_Subject.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical views==
===Charles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903)===

For Cutter the stability of subjects depends on a social process in which their meaning is stabilized in a name or a designation. A subject "referred [...] to those intellections [...] that had received a name that itself represented a distinct consensus in usage" (Miksa, 1983a, p.&amp;nbsp;60)&lt;ref&gt;Miksa, F. (1983a): Melvin Dewey and the Corporate Ideal. Pp. 49–100 IN: Melvin Dewey: The Man and the Classification. Ed. by G. Stevenson &amp; J. Kramer-Greene. Albany, NY: Forest Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and: the "systematic structure of established subjects" is "resident in the public realm" (Miksa, 1983a, p.&amp;nbsp;69); "[s]ubjects are by their very nature locations in a classificatory structure of publicly accumulated knowledge (Miksa, 1983a, p. 61). Bernd Frohmann adds: 

"The stability of the public realm in turn relies upon natural and objective mental structures which, with proper education, govern a natural progression from particular to general concepts. 
Since for Cutter, mind, society, and SKO [Systems of Knowledge Organization] stand one behind the other, each supporting each, all manifesting the same structure, his discursive construction of subjects invites connections with discourses of mind, education, and society. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC), by contrast, severs those connections. [[Melvil Dewey]] emphasized more than once that his system maps no structure beyond its own; there is neither a "transcendental deduction" of its categories nor any reference to Cutter's objective structure of social consensus. It is content-free: Dewey disdained any philosophical excogitation of the meaning of his class symbols, leaving the job of finding verbal equivalents to others. His innovation and the essence of the system lay in the notation. The DDC is a poorly semiotic system of expanding nests of ten digits, lacking any referent beyond itself. In it, a subject is wholly constituted in terms of its position in the system. The essential characteristic of a subject is a class symbol which refers only to other symbols. Its verbal equivalent is accidental, a merely pragmatic characteristic...
.... 
The conflict of interpretations over "subjects" became explicit in the battles between "bibliography" (an approach to subjects having much in common with Cutter's) and Dewey's "close classification". William Fletcher spoke for the scholarly bibliographer.... Fletcher's "subjects", like Cutter's, referred to the categories of a fantasized, stable social order, whereas Dewey's subjects were elements of a semiological system of standardized, techno-bureaucratic administrative software for the library in its corporate, rather than high culture, incarnation". (Frohmann, 1994, 112–113).&lt;ref&gt;Frohmann, B. (1994). The Social Construction of Knowledge Organization: The Case of Melvin Dewey. Advances in Knowledge Organization, 4, 109–117.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cutter's early view on what a subject is, is probably wiser than most understandings that dominated the 20th century – and also the understanding reflected in the ISO-standard quoted below. The early statements quoted by Frohmann indicate that subjects are somehow shaped in social processes. When that is said, it should be added that they are not particularly detailed or clear. We only get a vague idea of the social nature of subjects.

===S. R. Ranganathan (1892–1972)===

A system, which has en explicit theoretical foundation is Ranganathan's [[Colon Classification]]. Ranganathan provided an explicit definition of the concept of "subject":

{{Quote
|Subject – an organized body of ideas, whose extension and intention are likely to fall coherently within the field of interests and comfortably within the intellectual competence and the field of inevitable specialization of a normal person.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan, S. R. (1967). Prolegomena to library classification (p. 82). London: Asia Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
 
A related definition is given by one of Ranganathan's students: 

{{Quote
|A subject is an organized and systematized body of ideas. It may consist of one idea or a combination of several...&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, M. A. (1976). Colon Classification. In: A.Maltby (ed.): ''Classification in the 1970s: A second look (rev. ed.; pp. 51–80). London: Clive Bingly.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ranganathan's definition of "subject" is strongly influenced by his Colon Classification system. The colon system is based on the combination of single elements from facets to subject designation. This is the reason why the combined nature of subjects are emphasized so strongly. It  leads, however, to absurdities such as the claim that gold cannot be a subject (but is alternatively termed "an isolate"). This aspect of the theory has been criticized by Metcalfe (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;318).&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J. (1973). When is a Subject not a Subject? IN: Towards a theory of Librarianship. Ed. by Conrad H. Rawski. New York: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Metcalfe's skepticism regarding Ranganathan's theory is formulated in hard words (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;317): "This pseudo-science imposed itself on British disciples from about 1950 on...". 

It seems unacceptable that Ranganathan defines the word subject in a way that favors his own system. A scientific concept like "subject" should make it possible to compare different ways of establishing access to information. Whether or not subjects are combined or not should be examined once their definition has been given, it should not determined a priori, in the definition.

Besides the emphasis on the combined, organizing and systematizing nature of subjects contains Ranganathan's definition of subject the pragmatic demand, that a subject should be determined in a way that suits a normal person's competency or specialization. Again we see a strange kind of wishful thinking mixing a general understanding of a concept with demands put by his own specific system. One thing is what the word subject means, quite another issue is how to provide subject descriptions that fulfill demands such as the specificity of a given information retrieval language which fulfill demands put on the system, such as [[precision and recall]]. If researchers too often define terms in ways that favor specific kinds of systems, that are such definitions not useful to provide more general theories about subjects, subject analysis and IR.  Among other things are comparative studies of different kinds of systems made difficult. 

Based on these arguments (as well as additional arguments which have been used in the literature) we may conclude that Ranganathan's definition of the concept "subject" is not suited for scientific use. Like the definition of "subject" given by the ISO-standard for [[topic maps]] may Ranganathan's definition be useful within his own closed system. The purpose of a scientific and scholarly field is, however, to examine the relative fruitfulness of systems such as [[topic maps]] and Colon classification. For such purpose is another understanding of "subject" necessary.

===Patrick Wilson (1927–2003)===

In his book Wilson (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Patrick (1968). Two Kinds of Power. An Essay on Bibliographical Control. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; examined – in particular by thought experiments – the suitability of different methods of examining the subject of a document. The methods were:

* identifying the author's purpose for writing the document,
* weighing the relative dominance and subordination of different elements in the picture, which the reading imposes on the reader,
* grouping or count the document's use of concepts and references,
* construing a set of rules for selecting elements deemed necessary (as opposed to unnecessary) for the work as a whole.

Patrick Wilson shows convincingly that each of these methods are insufficient to determine the subject of a document and is led to conclude (&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Patrick (1968). Two Kinds of Power. An Essay on Bibliographical Control. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;89): "The notion of the subject of a writing is indeterminate..." or, on p.&amp;nbsp;92 (about what users may expect to find using a particular position in a library classification system): "For nothing definite can be expected of the things found at any given position". In connection to the last quote has Wilson an interesting footnote in which he writes that authors of documents often use terms in ambiguous  ways ("hostility" is used as an example). Even if the librarian could personally develop a very precise understanding of a concept, he would be unable to use it in his classification, because none of the documents use the term in the same precise way.  Based on this argumentation is Wilson led to conclude: "If people write on what are for them ill-defined phenomena, a correct description of their subjects must reflect the ill-definedness". 

Wilson's concept of subject was discussed by Hjørland (1992) who found that it is problematic to give up the precise understanding of such a basic term in LIS. Wilson's arguments led him to an agnostic position which Hjørland found unacceptable and unnecessary. Concerning the authors' use of ambiguous terms, the role of the subject analysis is to determine which documents would be fruitful for users to identify whether or not the documents use one or another term or whether a given term in a document is used in one or another meaning. Clear and relevant concepts and distinctions in classification systems and controlled vocabularies may be fruitful even if they are applied to documents with ambiguous terminology.

==="Content oriented" versus "Request oriented" views===

Request oriented indexing is indexing in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being indexed. The indexer ask himself: "Under which descriptors should this entity be found?" and "think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant" (Soergel, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;230).&lt;ref&gt;Soergel, Dagobert (1985). Organizing information: Principles of data base and retrieval systems. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Request oriented indexing may be indexing that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group. For example, a library or a database for feminist studies may index documents different compared to a historical library.  It is probably better, however, to understand request oriented indexing as policy based indexing: The indexing is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the indexing. In this way it is not necessarily a kind of indexing based on user studies. Only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request oriented indexing be regarded as a user-based approach.

The problem of whether the subject is in the content of a document (objectively) or in the mind of the individual users (subjectively) or in a community (intersubjectively, as a social construction) is a part of the philosophical [[subject–object problem]].

===The subject knowledge view===

Rowley &amp; Hartley (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;109)&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, Jennifer &amp; Hartley, Richard (2008). Organizing knowledge. An Introduction to Managing Access to Information. 4th edition. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "In order to achieve good consistent indexing, the indexer must have a through appreciation of the structure of the subject and the nature of the contribution that the document is making to the advancement of knowledge within a particular discipline". This is accordance with Hjørland's definition given above.

===Other views and definitions===

In the ISO-standard for [[topic maps]] the concept of subject is defined this way: 

"Subject
Anything whatsoever, regardless of whether it exists or has any other specific characteristics, about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever." ISO 13250-1, here cited from draft: http://www1.y12.doe.gov/capabilities/sgml/sc34/document/0446.htm#overview)

This definition may work well with the closed system of concepts provided by the topic maps standard. In broader contexts, however, is not fruitful because it does not contain any specification of what to identify in a document or in a discourse when ascribing subject identification terms or symbols to it. If different methods of subject analysis imply different results, which of these results can then be said to reflect the (true) subject? (Given that the expression "a true subject assignment" is meaningful at all, which is an important part of the problem). Different persons may have different opinions about what the subject of a specific document is. How can a theoretical understanding of the term "subject" be helpful deciding principles of subject analysis?

==Related concepts==
===Indexing words versus concepts versus subjects===

A proposal for the differentiation between concept indexing and subject indexing was given by Bernier (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Bernier, C.L. (1980). Subject Indexes. In: Kent, A.; Lancour, H. &amp; Daily, J.E. (eds.), Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 29. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker, Inc.: 191–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion subject indexes are different from, and can be contrasted with, indexes to concepts, topics and words. Subjects are what authors are working and reporting on. A document can have the subject of Chromatography if this is what the author wishes to inform about. Papers using Chromatography as a
research method or discussing it in a subsection do not have Chromatography as subjects. Indexers can easily drift into indexing concepts and words rather than subjects, but this is not good indexing. Bernier does not, however, differentiate author's subjects from those of the information seeker. A user may want a document about a subject, which is different from the one intended by its author. From the point of view of information systems, the subject of a document is related to the questions that the document can answer for the users (cf. the  distinction between a content oriented and a request-oriented approach). 

Hjørland &amp; Nicolaisen (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger &amp; Nicolaisen, Jeppe (2005). Bradford's Law of Scattering: Ambiguities in the Concept of "Subject". In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science: 96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the concept of subject in relation to [[Bradford's law]] of scattering and made a distinction between three kinds of scattering:
* lexical scattering – the scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts,
* semantic scattering – the scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts,
* subject scattering – the scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

===Isness===

"The FRSAR Working Group is aware that some controlled vocabularies provide terminology to express other aspects of works in addition to subject (such as form, genre, and target audience of resources). While very important and the focus of many user queries, these aspects describe isness or what class the work belongs to based on form or genre (e.g., novel, play, poem, essay, biography, symphony, concerto, sonata, map, drawing, painting, photograph, etc.) rather than what the work is about." (IFLA, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Ofness===

"Those LIS authors who have focused on the subjects of visual resources, such as artworks and photographs, have often been concerned with how to distinguish between the "aboutness" and the "ofness" (both specific and generic depiction or representation) of such works (Shatford, 1986). In this sense, "aboutness" has a narrower meaning than that used above. A painting of a sunset over San Francisco, for instance, might be analyzed as being (generically) "of" sunsets and (specifically) "of" San Francisco, but also "about" the passage of time." (IFLA, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;11).

'''''Tajweed''''' ({{lang-ar|تجويد}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tajwīd}}'', {{IPA-ar|tædʒˈwiːd|IPA}}, meaning "[[elocution]]"), Tajweed is an Arabic word, which literally means to beautify or adorn something. In the context of the recitation of the Quran Tajweed refers to a set of rules for the correct pronunciation of the letters with all its qualities and applying the various of recitation.  sometimes rendered as '''''tajweed''''', refers to the rules governing pronunciation during [[recitation]] of the [[Quran]]. The term is derived from the [[triliteral]] root ''{{transl|ar|ALA|j-w-d}}'' meaning "to make well, make better, improve". ''Tajweed'' is a  ''[[fard]]'' (compulsory-one must learn this best they can) when reciting the Quran to the best of one's ability.

== Arabic alphabet and grammar ==
{{Arabic alphabet}}
{{main article|Arabic alphabet|Arabic grammar|Sun and moon letters}}

The Arabic alphabet has 28 basic [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s, plus hamzah (ء).

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن و ہ ي}}&lt;/span&gt;

The Arabic word for "the" is ال ''al-'' (i.e. the letter ''[[Aleph|alif]]'' followed by ''[[lām]]''). The ''lām'' in ''al-'' is pronounced if the letter after it is "''qamarīyah''" ("lunar"), but if the letter after it is "''shamsīyah''" ("solar"), the ''lām'' after it becomes part of the following letter (is [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]]). "Solar" and "lunar" became descriptions for these instances as the words for "the moon" and "the sun" (''al-qamar'' and ''ash-shams'', respectively) are examples of this rule.

Lunar letters:
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|ا ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م هـ و ي}}&lt;/span&gt; 

Solar letters:
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن}}&lt;/span&gt;

== Emission points ==

There are 17 [[Place of articulation|emission points]] (''makhārij al-ḥurūf'') of the letters, located in various regions of the throat, tongue, lips, nose, and the mouth as a whole for the prolonged (''mudd'') letters.

The [[manner of articulation]] (''ṣifat al-ḥurūf'') refers to the different attributes of the letters. Some of the characteristics have opposites, while some are individual. An example of a characteristic would be the [[fricative consonant]] sound called ''ṣafīr'', which is an attribute of air escaping from a tube.

===Thickness and thinness===
{{see also|Emphatic consonants|Pharyngealization}}
The [[emphatic consonant]]s {{lang|ar|{{large|[[ḫāʾ|خ]] [[ṣād|ص]] [[ḍād|ض]] [[ṭāʾ|ط]] [[ẓāʾ|ظ]] [[ġayn|غ]] [[qāf|ق]]}}}}, known as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mufakhkham}}'' letters, are pronounced with a “heavy accent” (''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafkhīm}}''). This is done by either [[pharyngealization]] /ˤ/, i.e. pronounced while squeezing one's [[Larynx|voicebox]], or by [[velarization]] /ˠ/. The remaining letters&amp;nbsp;– the ''muraqqaq''&amp;nbsp;– have a “light accent” (''tarqīq'') as they are pronounced normally, without pharyngealization (except {{lang|ar|{{big|ع}}}}, which is often considered a pharyngeal sound).

{{lang|ar|{{large|[[ر]]}}}}&amp;nbsp;(''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|rāʼ&amp;nbsp;}}'') is heavy when accompanied by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|[[fatḥah]]}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|[[ḍammah]]}}'' and light when accompanied by a ''[[kasrah]]''. If its vowel sound is cancelled, such as by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|[[sukūn]]}}'' or the end of a sentence, then it is light when the first preceding voweled letter (without a ''sukun'') has a ''kasrah''. It is heavy if the first preceding voweled letter is accompanied by a ''fatḥah'' or ''ḍammah''. For example, the {{lang|ar|{{large|ر}}}} at the end of the first word of the ''[[Al-Asr|Sūrat "al-ʻAṣr"]]'' is heavy because the {{lang|ar|{{big|[[ʿayn|ع]]}}}}&amp;nbsp;(''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ʻayn}}'') has a ''fatḥah'':

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{Script/Arabic| وَالْعَصْرٍ }}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-top:0.5em;"&gt;
{{lang|ar|{{large|[[Lamedh|ل]]}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|lām}}'') is only heavy in the word ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Allāh}}''. If, however, the preceding vowel is a ''kasrah'', then the {{lang|ar|{{large|ل}}}} in ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Allāh}}'' is light, such as in the ''[[Basmala|Bismillah]]'':
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{Script/Arabic|  بِسْمِ الله}}&lt;/span&gt;

== Prolongation ==

Prolongation refers to the number of [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] (beats of time) that are pronounced when a voweled letter (''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|fatḥah}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ḍammah}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|kasrah}}'') is followed by a [[Arabic alphabet#Long vowels|''mudd'' letter]] (''alif'', ''yāʼ'' or ''wāw''). The number of morae then becomes two. If these are at the end of the sentence, such as in all the verses in "[[al-Fatiha]]", then the number of morae can be more than two, but must be consistent from verse to verse. Additionally, if there is a ''[[Arabic diacritics#Maddah|maddah]]'' sign over the ''mudd'' letter, it is held for four or five morae when followed by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|hamzah}}'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|ء}}}}) and six morae when followed by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|[[shadda]]h}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readwithtajweed.com/tajweed_MaddSukoon.htm |title=Madd sukoon |publisher=readwithtajweed.com |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the end of the last verse in "[[al-Fatiha]]" has a six-mora ''maddah'' due to the ''shaddah'' on the {{lang|ar|{{large|ل}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|lām}}'').

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic| صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ ٱلمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ ٱلضَّآلِّين }}&lt;/span&gt;

== ''Sākinah'' (vowelless) letters ==

===''Nūn sākinah'' and ''tanwīn''===
''Nūn sākinah'' refers to instances where the letter ''[[Nun (letter)|nūn]]'' is accompanied by a ''[[Nunation|tanwīn]]'' or ''[[sukun]]'' sign. There are then four ways it should be pronounced, depending on which letter immediately follows:
{{anchor|izhar}}
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|iẓhār&amp;#x202f;}}'' ("clarity"): the ''nūn'' sound is pronounced clearly without additional modifications when followed by "letters of the throat" ({{lang|ar|{{large|ء ه ع ح غ خ}}}}). Consider the ''nūn'' with a ''sukun'' pronounced regularly in the beginning of the last verse in "[[al-Fatiha]]": 
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic| صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ }}&lt;/span&gt; 
{{anchor|iqlab}}
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|iqlāb&amp;#x202f;}}'' ("conversion"): the ''nūn'' sound is converted to a {{IPA|/m/}} sound if it is followed by a {{lang|ar|{{large|[[bāʾ|ب]]}}}}. Additionally, it is pronounced in a ''ghunnah'' (a [[nasalization]] held for two morae). Consider the ''nūn'' sound on the tanwīn on the letter [[Dalet|dāl]] that is pronounced as a [[Mem|mīm]] instead in the chapter [[Al-Kafirun]]: 
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|وَلَا أَنَا عَابِدٌ مَا عَبَدْتُمْ}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{anchor|idgham}}
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|idghām&amp;#x202f;}}'' ("merging"): the ''nūn'' sound is not pronounced when followed by a {{lang|ar|{{large|[[Lamedh|ل]]}}}} or {{lang|ar|{{large|[[Resh|ر]]}}}}. There is also a ''ghunnah'' if it is followed by {{lang|ar|{{large|و م ي}}}} or another {{lang|ar|{{large|ن }}}}. ''Idghām'' only applies between two words and not in the middle of a word. Consider for example the ''nūn'' that is not pronounced in the fifth line (the [[Shahada]]) in the [[Adhan|Call to Prayer]]: 
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|  أَشْهَدُ أَن لَّا إِلٰهَ إِلَا ٱللهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً رَّسُولُ ٱللهِ}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{anchor|ikhfa}}{{anchor|ikhfa'}}
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ikhfāʼ&amp;nbsp;}}'' ("concealment"): the ''nūn'' sound is not fully pronounced (i.e. the tongue does not make full contact with the roof of the mouth as in a regular [[Alveolar nasal|/n/]] sound) if it is followed by any letters other than those already listed, includes a ''ghunnah''. Consider the ''nūn'' that is suppressed in the second verse of the chapter [[Al-Falaq]]: 
&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic| مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ}}&lt;/span&gt;

===''Mīm sākinah''===
The term ''mīm sākinah'' refers to instances where the letter ''[[Mem#Arabic mīm|mīm]]'' is accompanied by a ''[[sukun]]''. There are then three ways it should be pronounced, depending on which letter immediately follows:
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|idgham mutamathilayn&amp;#x202f;}}'' ("labial merging") when followed by another ''mīm'' (usually indicated by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|shaddah}}''): the ''mīm'' is then merged with the following ''mīm'' and includes a ''ghunnah'';
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ikhfāʼ shafawī&amp;nbsp;}}'' ("labial concealment"): the ''mīm'' is suppressed (i.e. lips not fully closed) and, when followed by a {{lang|ar|{{large|ب}}}}, includes a ''ghunnah'';
# ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|iẓhār shafawī&amp;#x202f;}}'' ("labial clarity"): the ''mīm'' is pronounced clearly with no amendment when followed by any letters other than those already listed.

{{anchor|qalqalah}}

== ''Qalqalah'' ==

The five ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|qalqalah}}'' letters are the consonants {{lang|ar|{{large|[[qāf|ق]] [[ṭāʾ|ط]] [[bāʾ|د]] [[ǧīm|ج]]}}}} {{lang|ar|{{large|[[dāl|ب]]}}}}. ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Qalqalah}}'' is the addition of a slight "bounce" or [[reduced vowel]] sound /[[mid-central vowel|ə]]/ to the consonant whose vowel sound is otherwise cancelled, such as by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|sukūn}}'', [[shadda|''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|shaddah}}'']], or the end of sentence.&lt;ref name=qalqalah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://studyislaam.org/hifdh/mod/resource/view.php?id=71 |title=Hifdh:qalqalah |publisher=Albaseera.org |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2011-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323171956/http://studyislaam.org/hifdh/mod/resource/view.php?id=71 |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "lesser bounce" occurs when the letter is in the middle of a word or at the end of the word but the reader joins it to the next word. A "medium bounce" is given when the letter is at the end of the word but is not accompanied by a ''shaddah'', such as the end of the first verse of the [[Al-Falaq|''Sūrat'' "al-Falaq"]]:&lt;ref name=qalqalah/&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic| قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ}}&lt;/span&gt;

The biggest bounce is when the letter is at the end of the word and is accompanied by a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|shaddah}}'', such as the end of the first verse of [[Al-Masadd|''Sūrat'' "al-Masad"]]'':&lt;ref name=qalqalah/&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic| تَبَّتْ يدَاۤ  اَبِی  لَهَبٍ وَّتَبَّ }}&lt;/span&gt;

== ''Waṣl'' ==
Waṣl is the rule of not pronouncing alif as a glottal stop /ʔ/, assimilating to its adjacent vowel. It is indicated with the diacritic waṣlah, a small ṣād on the letter alif (ٱ). In Arabic, words starting with alif not using a hamzah (ا) are capable to get a waṣlah.

&lt;span style="font-size:x-large;line-height:normal;"&gt;{{script/Arabic|بِسْمِ ٱللهِ ٱلرَّحْمٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ}}&lt;/span&gt;

In most of cases the vowel that must be used before alif waṣlah is obvious (the short or long vowel before alif waṣlah); but if it is before a syllable ending on another ḥarakah plus sukūn, then these are the rules:

{| class="wikitable"
! Last syllable plus sukūn as last ḥarakah || Acquired valor of sukūn after alif waṣlah || Example
|-
| Fatḥah /a/ || Kasrah /i/ || {{script/Arabic|مَنِ ٱبْنُ فُلَانٍ؟}}&lt;br /&gt;''Who's the son of so-and-so?''
|-
| Kasrah /i/ || Fatḥah /a/|| {{script/Arabic|مِنَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ}}&lt;br /&gt;''From the school''.
|-
| Ḍammah /u/ || Ḍammah /u/ || {{script/Arabic|وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''And Peace be upon you''.
|-
| Tanwin /-n/ || Tanwin + kasrah /-ni/ || {{script/Arabic|مُحَمَّدٌ ٱلكَرِيمُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''Muhammad the generous''.&lt;br /&gt;/muħamːaduni lkariːm/
|}

In the case of Tanwin and alif waṣlah, the intrusive kasrah between them is not graphically represented.

{{anchor|waqf}}

== ''Waqf'' ==
Waqf is the Arabic pausa rule; all words whose last letter end on a harakah become mute (sukūn) when being the last word of a sentence.

{| class="wikitable"
! Last letter of a word with a ḥarakah || Inherited valor of the ending ḥarakah in pausa (waqf) || Examples
|-
| {{script/Arabic|ء (أ إ ئ ؤ) ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي}}&lt;br /&gt; Ending on any ḥarakah || Sukūn /∅/ || {{script/Arabic|بَيْتْ}} - {{script/Arabic|بَيْتٌ}} house&lt;br /&gt;{{script/Arabic|اَلرَّبّْ}} - {{script/Arabic|اَلرَّبُّ}} The Lord
|-
| {{script/Arabic|ـًا ـًى}} ||{{script/Arabic|ـَا ـَى}} || {{script/Arabic|مُسْتَشْفَى}} - {{script/Arabic|مُسْتَشْفًى}} hospital&lt;br /&gt;{{script/Arabic|شُكْرَا}} - {{script/Arabic|شُكْرًا}} Thank you
|-
| {{script/Arabic|ة}}&lt;br /&gt; Ending on any ḥarakah || {{script/Arabic|هْ}} || {{script/Arabic|مَلِكَهْ}} - {{script/Arabic|مَلِكَةٍ}} queen
|}

In the case of the proper name عمرو /ʕamrun/, it is pronounced /ʕamr/ in pausa, and the last letter و wāw has no phonetical valor. And in fact, عمرو is a triptote (something irregular in most proper nouns, since they are usually diptotes).

{| class="wikitable"
!  || عمرو&lt;br /&gt;/ʕamr/ (a proper name)
|-
! Nominative
| {{script/Arabic|عمرٌو}}
|-
! Accusative
| {{script/Arabic|عمرًو}}
|-
! Genitive
| {{script/Arabic|عمرٍو}}
|-
! Pausal form (waqf)
| {{script/Arabic|عمرْو}}
|}

'''Tangut''' (also '''Xīxià''' or '''Hsi-Hsia''' or '''Mi-nia''') is an ancient northeastern [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]]&lt;ref name="Driem2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Languages of the Himalayas, Volume One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC&amp;pg=PA460|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12062-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; once spoken in the [[Western Xia]], also known as the Tangut Empire. It is classified by some linguists as a [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] language, which includes the [[Northern Qiang language|Northern]] and [[Southern Qiang language]]s and the [[Rgyalrong languages]], among others.

Tangut was one of the official languages of the Western Xia (known in Tibetan as ''Mi nyag'' and in Chinese as 彌藥 Míyào), which was founded by the [[Tangut people]] and obtained its independence from the [[Song dynasty]] at the beginning of the 11th century. The Western Xia were annihilated when [[Genghis Khan]] invaded in 1226.&lt;ref name="IDP02"&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 1995|title=IDP News Issue No. 2 |journal=IDP Newsletter |issue=2 |pages=2–3 |url= http://idp.bl.uk/downloads/newsletters/IDPNews02.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03 |issn=1354-5914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tangut language has its own script, the [[Tangut script]].

The latest known text written in the Tangut language, the [[Tangut dharani pillars]], dates to 1502,&lt;ref name="Mote2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick W. Mote|title=Imperial China 900-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SQWW7QgUH4gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01212-7|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the language was still in use nearly three hundred years after the destruction of the Tangut Empire.

==Rediscovery ==

Modern research into the Tangut languages began in the late 19th century and early 20th century when [[Stephen Wootton Bushell|S. W. Bushell]], Gabriel Devéria, and Georges Morisse separately published decipherments of a number of Tangut characters found on [[Western Xia coinage|Western Xia coins]], in a Chinese-Tangut bilingual inscription on a stele at [[Wuwei, Gansu]], and in a copy of the Tangut translation of the [[Lotus Sutra]].

The majority of extant Tangut texts were excavated at [[Khara-Khoto]] in 1909 by [[Pyotr Kozlov]], and the script was identified as that of the Tangut state of Xixia. Such scholars as [[Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov]], [[Ishihama Juntaro]] (石濱純太郎), [[Berthold Laufer]], [[Luo Fuchang]] (羅福萇), [[Luo Fucheng]] (羅福成), and [[Wang Jingru]] (王靜如) have contributed to research on the Tangut language. The most significant contribution was made by the Russian scholar [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky]] (1892–1937), who compiled the first Tangut Dictionary and reconstructed the meaning of a number of Tangut grammatical particles, thus making it possible to actually read and understand Tangut texts. His scholarly achievements were published posthumously in 1960 under the title "Tangutskaya Filologiya" (Tangut Philology) and the scholar was eventually (and posthumously) awarded the Soviet [[Lenin Prize]] for his work. The understanding of the Tangut language is far from perfect: Although certain aspects of the morphology ([[Ksenia Kepping]], ''The Morphology of the Tangut Language'', Moscow: Nauka, 1985) and grammar ([[Tatsuo Nishida]], ''Seika go no kenkyū'', etc.) are understood, the syntactic structure of Tangut remains largely unexplored.

The Khara-Khoto documents are at present preserved in the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. These survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]], but a number of manuscripts in the possession of Nevsky at the time of his arrest by the [[NKVD]] in 1937 went missing, and were returned, under mysterious circumstances, to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts only in October 1991.&lt;ref name="vanDriem"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Driem |first=George |year=1993 |title=Ancient Tangut manuscripts rediscovered |journal=  Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=137–155 |publisher= La Trobe University, Australia|issn=0731-3500 |format=PDF |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/vandriem1993ancient.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections amount to about 10,000 volumes, of mostly Buddhist texts, law codes and legal documents dating from mid-11th up to early 13th centuries. Among the Buddhist texts a number of unique compilations, not known either in Chinese or in Tibetan versions, were recently discovered. Furthermore, the Buddhist canon, the [[Chinese classics]], and a great number of indigenous texts written in Tangut have been preserved. These other major Tangut collections, though much smaller in size, belong to the [[British Library]], the National Library in Beijing, the Library of Beijing University and other libraries.

==Reconstruction==
{{further information|List of Tangut books}}
The connection between the writing and the pronunciation of the Tangut language is even more tenuous than that between Chinese writing and the modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]]. Thus although in Chinese more than 90% of the characters possess a phonetic element, this proportion is limited to about 10% in Tangut according to Sofronov. The reconstruction of Tangut pronunciation must resort to other sources.

The discovery of the ''[[Pearl in the Palm]]'', a Tangut-Chinese bilingual glossary, permitted Ivanov (1909) and Laufer (1916) to propose initial reconstructions and to undertake the comparative study of Tangut. This glossary in effect indicates the pronunciation of each Tangut character with one or several Chinese characters, and inversely each Chinese character with one or more Tangut characters. The second source is the corpus of Tibetan transcriptions of Tangut. These data were studied for the first time by Nevsky (Nevskij) (1925).

Nonetheless, these two sources were not in themselves sufficient for a systematic reconstruction of Tangut. In effect, these transcriptions were not written with the intention of representing with precision the pronunciation of Tangut, but instead simply to help foreigners to pronounce and memorize the words of one language with the words of another which they could understand.

The third source, which constitutes the basis of the modern reconstructions, consists of monolingual Tangut dictionaries: the ''Wenhai'' (文海), two editions of the ''Tongyin'' (同音), the ''Wenhai zalei'' (文海雜類) and an untitled dictionary. The record of the pronunciation in these dictionaries is made using the principle of  ''[[fanqie|fǎnqiè]]'', borrowed from the Chinese lexicographic tradition. Although these dictionaries may differ on small details  (e.g. the ''Tongyin'' categorizes the characters according to syllable initial and [[Syllable#Rime|rime]] without taking any account of tone), they all adopt the same system of 105 rimes. A certain number of rimes are in complementary distribution with respect to the place of articulation of the initials, e.g. rimes 10 and 11 or rimes 36 and 37, which shows that the scholars who composed these dictionaries had made a very precise phonological analysis of their language.

In distinction to the transcription in foreign languages, the Tangut ''fanqie'' makes distinctions among the rhymes in a systematic and very precise manner. Due to the ''fǎnqiè'', we now have a good understanding of the phonological categories of the language. Nonetheless, it is necessary to compare the phonological system of the dictionaries with the other sources in order to "fill in" the categories with a phonetic value.

N. A. Nevsky reconstructed Tangut grammar and provided the first Tangut–Chinese–English–Russian dictionary, which together with the collection of his papers was published posthumously in 1960 under the title ''Tangut Philology'' (Moscow: 1960). Later, substantial contribution to the research of Tangut language was done by {{nihongo|[[Tatsuo Nishida]]|西田龍雄}}, [[Ksenia Kepping]], [[Gong Hwang-cherng]] (龔煌城), M.V. Sofronov and [[Li Fanwen]] (李範文). [[Marc Miyake]] has published on Tangut phonology and diachronics.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyake |first=Marc |title=Complexity from Compression: A Sketch of Pre-Tangut |url=https://www.academia.edu/4154714/Complexity_from_Compression_A_Sketch_of_Pre-Tangut |accessdate=2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four Tangut dictionaries available: the one composed by N.A. Nevsky, one composed by Nishida (1966), one composed by Li Fanwen (1997, revised edition 2008) and one composed by [[Yevgeny Kychanov]] (2006).

There is growing a school of [[Tangut studies]] in China. Leading scholars include [[Shi Jinbo]] (史金波), Li Fanwen, Nie Hongyin (聶鴻音), Bai Bin (白濱) in mainland China, and Gong Hwang-cherng and Lin Ying-chin (林英津) in Taiwan. In other countries, leading scholars in the field include Yevgeny Kychanov and his student K. J. Solonin in Russia, Nishida Tatsuo and {{nihongo|[[Shintarō Arakawa]]|荒川慎太郎}} in Japan, and Ruth W. Dunnell in the United States.

==Phonology==
The Tangut syllable has a CV structure and carries one of two distinctive tones, flat or rising. Following the tradition of Chinese phonological analysis the Tangut syllable is divided into initial (声母) and rhyme (韻母) (i.e. the remaining syllable minus the initial).

===Consonants===
The consonants are divided into the following categories:

The rhyme books distinguish 105 rhyme classes, which are, in turn, classified in several ways:/grade (等), type (環), and class (攝).

Tangut rhymes occur in three types (環). They are seen in the tradition of Nishida, followed by both Arakawa and Gong as 'normal' (普通母音), 'tense' (緊候母音), and 'retroflex' (捲舌母音). Gong leaves normal vowels unmarked and places a dot under tense vowels and an -r after retroflex vowels. Arakawa differs only by indicating tense vowels with a final -q.

The rhyme books distinguish four vowel grades (等). In early phonetic reconstructions, all four were separately accounted for, but it has since been realized that grades three and four are in complementary distribution, depending on the initial. Consequently, the reconstructions of Arakawa and Gong do not account for this distinction. Gong represents these three grades as V, iV, and jV. Arakawa accounts for them as V, iV, and V.

In general rhyme class (攝), corresponds to the set of all rhymes under the same rhyme type which have the same main vowel.

Gong further posits phonemic vowel length and points to evidence that indicates that Tangut had a distinction that Chinese lacked. There is no certainty that the distinction was vowel length and so other researchers have remained skeptical.

Miyake reconstructs the vowels differently. In his reconstruction, the 95 vowels of Tangut formed from a six-vowel system in Pre-Tangut because of preinitial loss. (The two vowels in parentheses appeared only in loanwords from Chinese, and many of the vowels in class III were in complementary distribution with their equivalents in class IV.)

{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Two Finger Salute.JPG|thumb|A student at [[State University of New York at Purchase|Purchase College]] demonstrating the two-finger salute.]]
The '''two-finger salute''' is a [[salute]] given using only the middle and index fingers, while bending the other fingers at the second knuckle, and with the palm facing the signer. This salute is used by the [[Polish Armed Forces]], other uniformed services, and, in some countries, the [[Cub Scouts]].

==Two-finger salute in Poland==

[[Image:Ludwik Solski.jpg|thumb|A two-fingers salute. Drawing by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], 1904.]]
The '''Polish two-finger salute''' is only used while wearing a headdress with the emblem of the Polish eagle (such as military hat [[rogatywka]]) or without this emblem (such as [[Boonie hat]] or helmet). The salute is performed with the middle and index fingers extended and touching each other, while the ring and little fingers are bent and touched by the thumb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/pictures/women2004/b040922n.jpg A woman giving a Polish salute.] ''nato.int'' Accessed June 6,  2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The tips of the middle and index fingers touch the peak of the cap, two fingers meaning ''honour'' and ''fatherland'' (''Honor i Ojczyzna'').{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}
[[File:OddawanieHonorow.png|left|thumb|Salute as in Polish military regulation]]
It is not clear when the two-fingers salute appeared in Polish military forces. Some see its origin in [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]'s 1794 [[:Image:686px-Smuglewicz Kosciuszko.jpg|oath]]. Others state that it came from Polish soldiers in the [[Congress Kingdom]] army around 1815 ([[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]). At that time, apparently the Tsar's [[Congress Poland|Viceroy in Poland]] [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]] said that Poles salute him with two fingers, while using the other two to hold a stone to throw at him. Another legend attributes the salute to the remembrance of [[Battle of Olszynka Grochowska]] in 1831, when a soldier who lost in the battle all his fingers but the middle and index ones, saluted his superior with the wounded hand, and died after it.

It symbolized God and Country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Archibald L.|title=Between Hitler and Stalin: The Quick Life and Secret Death of Edward Smigly-Rydz Marshal of Poland|date=2010|isbn=978-160844-563-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-fingers salute caused problems for Polish units serving with the Allies on the western front during [[World War II]]. Allied officers, seeing what they perceived as a [[Cub Scout]]'s salute, thought that Polish soldiers were deliberately being disrespectful. As a result, many soldiers were [[arrest]]ed, until the misunderstanding could be explained. This led to the temporary use of the full hand salute when saluting foreign officers.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Cub Scouting==

[[File:Wolf Scouts experience colors aboard Marine air station 121115-M-OB827-038.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]]s of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] saluting.]] 
Many [[Cub Scout]] sections also use a two-finger salute. The salute was devised by [[Robert Baden-Powell]] and originally represented the two ears of a wolf cub, since the original programme was based on [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baden-Powell, Robert [http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/wolfcubshandbook.pdf ''The Wolf Cub's Handbook''], Arthur Pearson (p.15)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cubs in several national associations now use the three-finger Scout salute used by the rest of the [[Scout Movement]].
