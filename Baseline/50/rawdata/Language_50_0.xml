{{About|the language and script used for ancient Hebrew and Aramaic||Assyrian script (disambiguation){{!}}Assyrian script}}

'''Ashuri''' refers to the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] language and script mentioned in the [[Megillah (Talmud)|Tractate Megillah]] and the [[Talmud|Talmud Bavli]].

==Lashon Ashuri==
The mention of Lashon Ashuri, or Assyrian language, is referenced twice in the Tractate Megillah, in Megillah 17a:9 and Megillah 18a:23, where the Rabbi interchanges Ashuri with [[Hebrew]]. Hebrew is also referred to as [[Lashon Hakodesh]], or ''Holy Tongue''. The interchanging of Ashuri with Hebrew prompts the understanding that Ashuri, Hebrew, and Lashon Hakodesh are one and the same language.

==Ktav Ashuri==
Ktav Ashuri ({{lang-he-n|כְּתָב אַשּׁוּרִי}}, ''{{transl|he|ktav ashurí}}''), or Assyrian script, is a traditional calligraphic form of the alphabet shared between [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. Over some centuries, certain ornaments were simplified or removed for use outside traditional religious calligraphy, to become the modern print form of the Hebrew alphabet, which it most closely resembles.

Mention of the Ashuri script first appears in rabbinic writings of the [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic periods, referring to the formal script used in certain [[Jewish]] ceremonial items, such as [[sefer Torah|sifrei Torah]], [[tefillin]], and [[mezuzah|mezuzot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm|title=Judaism 101: Hebrew Alphabet|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|date=|website=www.jewfaq.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sometimes called the "square" script, the term is used to distinguish the Ashuri script from the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. 

In the Tractate Sanhedrin 22a:2 and 22a:4 it states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
למה נקרא אשורית שעלה עמהם מאשור (Why is Ashuri referred to as Ashuri?)&lt;br&gt;
The ''baraita'' continues: '''Why''' is this script '''called ''Ashurit''? Because it ascended with''' the Jewish people '''from Ashur''' when they returned from their exile in Babylonia.

למה נקרא שמה אשורית שמאושרת בכתב (Why is Ashuri approved in writing?)&lt;br&gt;
The ''baraita'' continues: If this script predates the exile to Babylonia, '''why is it called ''Ashurit''? Because it is ''meusheret'',''' beautiful and straight, '''in script.'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Talmud states that Ashuri was authorized (''meusheret'') in writing, and that the script ascended with the Jewish people from Ashur, upon their return from the Babylonian exile. This is how the Assyrian script became in use for the Jewish people. The reference of the script as beautiful and straight is a subjective understanding of the Rabbi, in the Talmud itself it is only asked why the Ashuri in the Tractate Megillah is referred to as Ashuri, to which the baraita continues because it was authorized for writing, ascending from Ashur.

[[Image:Example of Ashuri Ashkenaz Alphabet on Parchment.jpg|thumb|This is a sample of the Ashuri alphabet written according to the Ashkenaz scribal custom on parchment (klaf)]]

== Ritual use of the script ==
There are many rules concerning the proper formation of letters if the written text is to be valid for religious purposes.

[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Mizrahi]], and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] Jews each have their own calligraphic tradition regarding certain details of how each letter is formed, although the overall shape is similar. Generally, while each tradition favors their own calligraphic style, none consider the other traditions ''passul'' (invalid) for [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] or any other ritually used scroll or parchment.

[[Samaritans]] maintain a calligraphic tradition different from the Ashuri script, using instead the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet they employ for their scriptures.

[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|right|thumb| alt=refer to caption | An AAC user indicates a series of numbers on an eye gaze communication board in order to convey a word.]] 
'''Augmentative and alternative communication''' ('''AAC''') is an [[umbrella term]] that encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those with a wide range of [[speech and language impairment]]s, including congenital impairments such as [[cerebral palsy]], [[intellectual impairment]] and [[autism]], and acquired conditions such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.

Modern use of AAC began in the 1950s with systems for those who had lost the ability to speak following surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual [[sign language]] and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and [[speech synthesis]], have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]].
 
AAC systems are diverse: unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and [[body language]], while aided approaches use external tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/|title=Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)|author=|date=|website=www.asha.org|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided communication methods can range from paper and pencil to communication books or boards to speech generating devices (SGDs) or devices producing written output. The symbols used in AAC include gestures, photographs, pictures, line drawings, letters and words, which can be used alone or in combination. Body parts, pointers, [[Mouse (computer)|adapted mice]], or [[eye tracking]] can be used to select target symbols directly, and [[switch access scanning]] is often used for indirect selection. Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication, and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used to reduce the number of selections required. These techniques include "prediction", in which the user is offered guesses of the word/phrase being composed, and "encoding", in which longer messages are retrieved using a prestored code.

The evaluation of a user's abilities and requirements for AAC will include the individual's motor, visual, cognitive, language and communication strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation requires the input of family members, particularly for early intervention. Respecting [[ethnicity]] and family beliefs are key to a [[Family centered care|family-centered]] and ethnically competent approach.  Studies show that AAC use does not impede the development of speech, and may result in a modest increase in speech production. Users who have grown up with AAC report satisfying relationships and life activities; however, they may have poor literacy and are unlikely to be in [[employment]].

The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] defines augmentative and alternative communication one of [[communication]]s as well as display of text, [[large-print]], [[Touch|tactile]] communication, [[plain language]], accessible [[multimedia]] and accessible [[information and communications technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]: Article 2: Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Augmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language.&lt;ref name=asha2005&gt;[[#refASHA2005|ASHA]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; People making use of AAC include individuals with a variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5"/&gt; [[Prevalence]] data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLindsay|Lindsay et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGross|Gross]].&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known AAC users include physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], broadcaster [[Roger Ebert]] and poet [[Christopher Nolan (author)|Christopher Nolan]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 6-8"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEbert|Ebert]].&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning films such as ''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' and ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', based on books by AAC users [[Christy Brown]] and [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]] respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLapointe|Lapointe]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWalling|Walling]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The field was originally called "Augmentative Communication"; the term served to indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to replace it. The addition of "alternative" followed later, when it became clear that for some individuals non-speech systems were their only means of communication.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt; AAC users typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on the communication partners and the context.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three, relatively independent, research areas in the 1960s and 1970s that lead to the field of augmentative and alternative communication. First was the work on early electromechanical communication and writing systems. The second was the development of communication and language boards, and lastly there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Gregg C. |last=Vanderheiden |year=2002 |title=A journey through early augmentative communication and computer access |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=39–53 |url=http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/02/39/6/sup/vanderheiden.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001002015/http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/02/39/6/sup/vanderheiden.html |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of AAC==

===Unaided AAC===
[[File:Interpbleu.gif|thumb| alt=refer to caption| Sign for "interpreter" in [[Quebec Sign Language]]]]
Unaided AAC systems are those that do not require an external tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, [[gestures]], and [[sign language]]s and systems.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003"&gt;[[#refMirenda2003|Mirenda]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 38–42, 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including [[dementia]], [[aphasia]] and [[dysarthria]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 42"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloydEtal|Lloyd et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, sign languages have a linguistic base and permit the expression of an unlimited number of messages.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 42"/&gt; Approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories, those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right.&lt;ref name=Millikin&gt;[[#refMillikin|Millikin]], pp. 103–107.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Signing Exact English]] may be considered the most widely used example of the former and [[American Sign Language]] as a common example of the latter.&lt;ref name=Millikin/&gt; Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and [[motor planning]] skills.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCumleySwanson|Cumley &amp; Swanson]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sign languages require more fine-motor coordination and are less [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the person's communication without training.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDaniloff1983|Daniloff]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DandV&gt;[[#refDaniloffVergara|Daniloff &amp; Vergara]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 107" /&gt;

  }}
An AAC aid is any "device, either electronic or non-electronic, that is used to transmit or receive messages";&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5" /&gt; such aids range from communication books to [[speech generating device]]s.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003"/&gt; Since the skills, areas of difficulty and communication needs of AAC users vary greatly, an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGillamEtal|Gillam et al.]], pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Low-tech====
Low-tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message.&lt;ref name=millarscott1998&gt;[[#refMillarScott1998|Millar &amp; Scott]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a [[Partner-assisted scanning|listener scans through possible options]].&lt;ref name=scott1998&gt;[[#refScott1998|Scott]], pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-tech====
{{main|Speech_generating_device| l1=Speech generating device}}
High-tech AAC aids permit the storage and retrieval of electronic messages, with most allowing the user to communicate using speech output.&lt;ref name="GlennenDeCoste62"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are known as speech generating devices (SGD) or voice output communication aids (VOCA).&lt;ref name="schlosserblischakkoul"&gt;[[#refSchlosserBlischakKoul|Schlosser, Blischak &amp; Koul]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A device's speech output may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while [[speech synthesis|synthesized speech]] uses text-to-speech software that can be harder to understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak novel messages.&lt;ref name="schlosserblischakkoul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices.&lt;ref name="GlennenDeCoste62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jansclark1998&gt;[[#refJansClark|Jans &amp; Clark]], pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHochstein2004|Hochstein]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech devices vary in the amount of information that they can store, as well as their size, weight and thus their portability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Access methods depend on the abilities of the user, and may include the use of direct selection of symbols on the screen or keyboard with a body part, pointer, adapted [[Mouse (computing)|mice]] or [[joystick#Assistive technology|joysticks]], or indirect selection using switches and scanning.&lt;ref name="jansclark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:TextSpeak-AAC-Speech-Talking-Keyboard.png|thumb|Keyboard used to create speech over a telephone using a Text to Speech converter.]] Devices with voice output offer its user the advantage of more communicative power, including the ability to initiate conversation with communication partners who are at a distance.&lt;ref name=decoste&gt;[[#refGlennenchap10|Decoste]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they typically require programming,&lt;ref name=decoste/&gt; and tend to be unreliable.

High-tech systems can also include Keyboard based solutions that do not require programming with a mix of flexibility, simplicity, and associated reliability. In this case, a keyboard and audio speaker are configured to be create a ''"talking keyboard"'' where typed text is spoken directly in an audio speaker. This allows any phrase to be spoken as it is typed using unlimited vocabulary text-to-speech conversion. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone can enable a voice impaired individual have 2 way conversation over a telephone.

In all cases of use, low tech systems often recommended as a backup in case of device failure.&lt;ref name="jansclark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith|Smith &amp; Connolly]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShepherd|Shepherd et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==

Symbols are visuals used to represent objects, actions, and concepts through the use of items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.[[Tangible symbol systems|Tactile symbols]] which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with [[visual impairment]]s and/or significant intellectual impairments.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 51-53"&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockerill169"&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refHazel2001|Hazel]], p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. [[Picture exchange communication system|Picture Communication Exchange System]] (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). [https://www.prentrom.com/prc_advantage/language-systems LAMP Words for Life], a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 51-53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockerill169" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refWilliams|Williams]], pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.

==Access and selection methods==
{{See also|Switch Access Scanning}}
[[File:eyegaze.jpg|left|thumb|alt= a user in a wheelchair faces a communication partner who holds a transparent piece of plastic between them, the plastic has the letters of the alphabet printed around the edges| A subject uses eye-gaze to indicate choices on a transparent letter-based communication board. This is a form of "Direct Selection".]]
Technological advances have dramatically increased the types of selection methods available for individuals with communication impairments.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; 
In "Direct Selection", the selection is made by pointing to the desired symbol using a finger or an alternative pointer, such as eye gaze, a head stick, head- or eye-controlled mouse. To accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies; for example in "timed activation", the user maintains selection of the symbol for a predetermined period of time until it is recognized by the system. With the "release activation", the selection of the item is only made when the person releases contact from the display.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct activation of an AAC system is generally the first choice of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or "scanning".  In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as [[switch access|a switch]], vocalization or gesture.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 97–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p73"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Several different patterns for [[switch access scanning]] are available: in "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"/&gt;

There are three main selection control techniques in scanning. In "automatic scanning", the scan proceeds at a pre-determined speed and pattern until the user selects an item. In "inverse scanning", the switch is held down to advance the scan, and released to choose the desired iem. In "step scanning", the AAC user activates one switch to move the indicator through the items, and another switch to select the item.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"/&gt;

==Vocabulary organization==
{{See also|Speech_generating_device#Selection_set_and_vocabulary|label 1=Speech Generating Devices: Vocabulary}}
Vocabulary organization refers to the way pictures, words, phrases, and sentences are displayed on the communication system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlackstone1993|Blackstone (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the goal is to facilitate efficient and effective communication, especially when the individual's AAC system contains a large number of symbols.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 107"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 107–110.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:gotalk.jpg|left|thumb| alt=an electronic device with speakers and a slot to insert cards that have new sets of symbols on them. The current card has 25 symbols that relate to book reading | A static digitized speech communication device with a book reading (activity-based) overlay]]
Communication books and devices are often presented in a grid format;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 336"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; the vocabulary items displayed within them may be organized by spoken word order, frequency of usage or category. In the Fitzgerald Key organization, symbols from different semantic and syntactic classes are organized grammatically in groups from left to right to facilitate sentence construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrandenbergVanderheiden|Brandenberg &amp; Vanderheiden]], pp. 84–135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since research has shown that children and adults use a small number of words frequently,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelman1989|Beukelman (1989)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarvinEtal1994|Marvin et al. (1994)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in a core-fringe vocabulary organization, the words and messages that are communicated most frequently appear on a "main page". The fringe vocabulary—words and messages used more rarely and that are specific to an individual—appear on other pages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols may also be organized by category, grouping people, places, feelings, foods, drinks, and action words together.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 336" /&gt; Another form of grid organization groups vocabulary according to specific activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 336–338.&lt;/ref&gt; Each display contains symbols for the people, places, objects, feelings, actions, and other relevant vocabulary items for a specific activity or routine.&lt;ref name="DragerLightSpeltz"&gt;[[#refDragerLightSpeltz|Drager, Light &amp; Speltz]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:V Max speech generating device with headmouse extreme access.jpg|right|thumb| alt=A screen showing a stylised version of a bedroom, mounted on top of the screen is the sensor for a head mouse| Speech generating device using a visual scene display, accessed using a head mouse]] 
Visual scene displays are a different method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience.&lt;ref name="BM338"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlackstone2004|Blackstone (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication.&lt;ref name="DragerLightSpeltz"/&gt; Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.&lt;ref name= "Higginbotham"&gt;[[#refHigginbothamEtal|Higginbotham et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDragerEtal2004|Drager et al. (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rate enhancement strategies==
{{See also|Speech_generating_device#Rate_enhancement_strategies|label 1=Speech Generating Devices: Rate enhancement strategies}}
Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech,&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"&gt;[[#refUWAAC|University of Washington (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; with users generally producing 8–10 words per minute.&lt;ref name ="Higginbotham" /&gt; Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output to around 12–15 words per minute,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; and as a result enhance the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]].  There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication: encoding and prediction.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"/&gt;

Encoding is a technique permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word, sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their AAC system.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt;  In numeric, alpha-numeric, and letter encoding (also known as abbreviation-expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing "HH" may retrieve "Hello, how are you?".&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt; In iconic encoding strategies, such as [[Semantic compaction]], icons (picture symbols) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases.&lt;ref name=venkatagiri&gt;[[#refVenkatagiri|Venkatagiri]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. [[Word prediction]] software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt;

==Assessment and system implementation==

| quote = I stiffened my body and put my left foot out again, for the third time. I drew one side of the letter. I drew half the other side... I set my teeth so hard that I nearly pierced my lower lip. But – I drew it – the letter 'A'... Shaky, with awkward, wobbly sides and a very uneven centre line... I had done it! I had started – the thing that was to give my mind its chance of expressing itself. True, I couldn't speak with my lips, but now I would speak through something more lasting than spoken words – written words.

An evaluation of an individual's abilities, limitations and communication needs is necessary to select appropriate AAC techniques. The purpose of the assessment is to identify potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user's current communication and their present and future communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 331–332.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a [[speech pathology|speech-language pathologist]], [[occupational therapist]], [[rehabilitation engineer]], [[physiotherapist]], [[social worker]] and a [[physician]].&lt;ref name="BM Team"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 118–125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mineo"&gt;[[#refMineo|Mineo]].&lt;/ref&gt; Users, family members and teachers are also key members of the decision making team.&lt;ref name="Mineo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;[[#refParetteEtal2000|Parette et al. (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity to and respect of [[cultural diversity]] contributes to ongoing family involvement and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAngelo|Angelo]], pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BM Cultural"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParetteAngelo|Parette &amp; Angelo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCrais1991|Crais]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "special"&gt;[[#refKalyanpurHarry|Kalyanpur &amp; Harry]], pp. 246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;  For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing.&lt;ref name="BM Cultural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParetteBrotherson|Parette &amp; Brotherson]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDinnebeil|Dinnebeil]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A user's motor abilities, communication skills and needs, [[cognition]] and vision are assessed in order to determine the most appropriate match to a communication system.&lt;ref name="Mineo"/&gt; Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with [[spasticity|spastic]] arm movements may require a [[Assistive technology#Accessible computer input|key guard]] on top of the keyboard or [[touchscreen]] to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 6-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BM Team"/&gt; Researcher [[Janice Light]] identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as "please" and "thank you". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 8-10"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLight1988|Light, 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTurnbull|Turnbull]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWehmeyerPalmer|Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 151-152"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; and influence family attitudes towards AAC.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 151-152"/&gt;

Training can help the user make use of their AAC system to communicate effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 227–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled users of AAC show [[communicative competence]] in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLightMcNaughton2014|Light &amp; McNaughton, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistic competence]] refers to language skills in the person's native language as well as the linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while [[social competence]] and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 10-14"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLight1989|Light, 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly because there is a danger that [[learned helplessness]] can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPenningtonMcConachie|Pennington &amp; McConachie]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClarkeWilkinson|Clarke &amp; Wilkinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Young AAC users benefit from rich language and literacy experiences to foster [[vocabulary]] development, [[discourse]] skills, and [[phonological awareness]], all of which supports successful literacy learning.&lt;ref name = "sturm"/&gt; Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the individual's communication system themselves.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 10-14"/&gt; They also benefit from focussed and explicit reading instruction.&lt;ref name="Fallon 2004"&gt;[[#refFallonEtal2004|Fallon et al. (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blischak"&gt;[[#refBlischak|Blischak]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Speech===
Several reviews have found that the use of AAC does not impede the development of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt"&gt;[[#refSchlosserWendt|Schlosser &amp; Wendt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millar2006"&gt;[[#refMillar2006|Millar et al.]].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change.&lt;ref name="Millar2006"/&gt; A descriptive review looking specifically at [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;[[#refPreston2009|Preston (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers hypothesize that using an AAC device relieves the pressure of having to speak, allowing the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in [[psychological stress]] makes speech production easier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchlosserLloyd|Schlosser &amp; Lloyd]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others speculate that in the case of speech generating devices, the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCressMarvin|Cress &amp; Marvin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and literacy===

Language and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and [[social interaction]] in a variety of settings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverEtal1991b|Koppenhaver et al. (1991b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities.&lt;ref name="Light, J. 1993"/&gt; Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, [[syntax]], and impaired [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] skills.&lt;ref name = "sturm"/&gt; These delays may be due in part to the fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities.&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;[[#sutton|Sutton, Soto &amp; Blockberger 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. &lt;!-- reference (with US authors) says 'second grade level'. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSturmEtal2006|Sturm et al. (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development,&lt;ref name = "sturm"&gt;[[#refSturmClendon|Sturm &amp; Clendon]].&lt;/ref&gt; but [[environmental factor]]s also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverEtal1991a|Koppenhaver et al. (1991a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Light, J. 1993"&gt;[[#refLightMcNaughton|Light &amp; McNaughton]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ericksonkoppen"&gt;[[#refEricksonKoppenhaver|Erickson &amp; Koppenhaver]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverYoder|Kopperhaver &amp; Yoder]].&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.&lt;ref name="Fallon 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blischak"/&gt;

===Employment===
According to a 1997 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] report less than 10% of severely disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"&gt;[[#refHammMirenda|Hamm &amp; Mirenda]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMankEtal|Mank et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong [[work ethic]] and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills.&lt;ref name="McNaughton, D. Light 2002"&gt;[[#refMcNaughtonEtal|McNaughton et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others.&lt;ref name="McNaughton, D. Light 2001"&gt;[[#refMcNaughtonLight|McNaughton &amp; Light]].&lt;/ref&gt; Employers of AAC users report that skills in [[time management]], [[problem solving]], communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBryanEtal|Bryen et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of life===
Several studies of young adults who had used AAC since childhood report a generally good [[quality of life]], though few lived independently, or were in paid employment.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight1"/&gt; The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight2"&gt;[[#reflundlight2|Lund &amp; Light (2007a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight1"&gt;[[#reflundlight1|Lund &amp; Light (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight3"&gt;[[#reflundlight3|Lund &amp; Light (2007b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer outcomes were related to lack of access to appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight3"/&gt;

==Specific groups of AAC users==

===Cerebral palsy===
[[Cerebral palsy]] is a term referring to a non-progressive developmental [[Movement disorder|neuromotor disorder]] with an [[upper motor neuron lesion]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the location of the brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected.&lt;ref name="trevrob"&gt;[[#refTreviranusRoberts|Treviranus &amp; Roberts]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dysarthria]], a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUtley|Utley]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device.&lt;ref name="trevrob"/&gt; Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.&lt;ref name=Myrdenetal2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myrden|first1=Andrew|last2=Schudlo|first2=Larissa|last3=Weyand|first3=Sabine|last4=Zeyl|first4=Timothy|last5=Chau|first5=Tom|title=Trends in Communicative Access Solutions for Children With Cerebral Palsy|journal=[[Journal of Child Neurology]]|date=August 2014|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1108–1118|doi=10.1177/0883073814534320|pmid=24820337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual impairment===
[[File:cheaptalk and switch.jpg|right|thumb| alt= a small electronic device with several buttons, there is a cable going from the device to an activation button. |Phrases can be recorded onto simple switch-operated AAC devices by a user or carer so that the recording is played when the switch is pressed.]] Individuals with [[intellectual impairment]]s face challenges in developing communication skills, including problems with [[Applied behavior analysis|generalization]] (the transfer of learned skills into daily activities). They may lack communication opportunities in their daily lives, and responsive communicators who understand their communication methods.&lt;ref name="BM II"/&gt; AAC intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for integrated, natural communication.&lt;ref name="BM II"/&gt; Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC techniques with children and adults with intellectual impairments can enhance communication skills,&lt;ref name="McIlvane"&gt;[[#refWilkinsonMcIlvane|Wilkinson &amp; McIlvane]], pp. 273–322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheslock"&gt;[[#refCheslockEtal|Cheslock et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; increase participation in activities,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt; choice-making,&lt;ref name="Cosbey"&gt;[[#refCosbeyJohnston|Cosbey &amp; Johnston]].&lt;/ref&gt; and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication partners.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

While most individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have concomitant [[challenging behaviour|behavioural issues]], problems in this area are typically more prevalent in this population than others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBatshaw|Batshaw]], pp. 287–305.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC approaches may be used as part of teaching functional communication skills to non-speaking individuals as an alternative to "acting out" for the purpose of exerting independence, taking control, or informing preferences.&lt;ref name="BM II"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 241–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
[[Autism]] is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChiangLin|Chiang &amp; Lin]].&lt;/ref&gt; People with autism have been found to have strong [[visual processing]] skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.&lt;ref name="Cafiero"&gt;[[#refCafiero|Cafiero]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
AAC intervention in this population is directed towards the linguistic and social abilities of the child,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 246–248.&lt;/ref&gt; including providing the person with a concrete means of communication, as well as facilitating the development of interactional skills.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2001"&gt;[[#refMirenda2001|Mirenda (2001)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

AAC systems for this population generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS).&lt;ref name="Mirenda2001" /&gt; A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those with little or no functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on [[Social relation|social interaction]] and [[challenging behaviour]]s.&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt; A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSonEtal|Son et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental verbal dyspraxia===
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], also known as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a developmental [[motor speech disorders|motor speech disorder]] involving impairments in the motor control of speech production.&lt;ref name="Bornman"&gt;[[#refBornmanEtal|Bornman et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech of a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.&lt;ref name="BM DD"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 250–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of AAC systems have been used with children with developmental verbal dyspraxia.&lt;ref name="handbook1"&gt;[[#refWeitzEtal|Weitz et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can include the use of [[fingerspelling]] alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation.&lt;ref name="BM DD"/&gt; Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices.&lt;ref name="handbook1" /&gt; A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child can take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation.&lt;ref name="BM DD"/&gt;

===Traumatic brain injury===
[[Traumatic brain injury]] can result in severe motor speech disorders; [[dysarthria]] is the most common such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTheodorosEtal|Theodoros et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition.&lt;ref name="Fager s 2006b"&gt;[[#refFagerEtal2006b|Fager et al. (2006b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.&lt;ref name="Fager s 2006b" /&gt;

===Aphasia===
[[Aphasia]] is the result of damage to the brain's language centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanEtal2007|Beukelman et al. (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.&lt;ref name="foxfriedoken"&gt;[[#refFoxFriedOken|Fox &amp; Fried-Oken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on their language and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"/&gt; Visual scene displays have been used on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"/&gt; Approaches such as "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGarrettLasker|Garrett &amp; Lasker]], pp. 475–481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKaganEtal|Kagan et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words they are trying to say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.

===Locked-in syndrome===
[[Stroke]]s that occur in the [[brainstem]] may cause profound deficits, including [[locked-in syndrome]],&lt;ref name=teasell&gt;[[#refTeasellEtal|Teasel et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost.&lt;ref name=soderholm&gt;[[#refSoderholmEtal|Soderholm et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice.&lt;ref name=fager&gt;[[#refFagerEtal2006a|Fager et al. (2006a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements are most likely to be preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. [[Partner-assisted scanning]] may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with [[motor control]], vision, memory, [[alertness]] and linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements,&lt;ref name="fager" /&gt; which can be used to access a communication device.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt;

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis===
[[File:Stephen hawking 2008 nasa.jpg|alt=as caption| thumb|left|[[Stephen Hawking]], a noted physicist with ALS who used AAC]] [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) or [[Motor Neurone Disease]] (MND) is a progressive condition which leads to weakness and eventual [[paralysis]]. Approximately 75% of people with ALS are unable to speak by the time of their death.&lt;ref name="DoyleALS"&gt;[[#refDoylePhillips|Doyle &amp; Phillips]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a procedure known as voice banking, people with ALS may digitally record words and phrases while still able to do so, for later inclusion in a communication device.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStern|Stern]].&lt;/ref&gt; AAC systems used typically change over time depending on severity of speech impairment, physical status, and the individual's communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of augmentative communication strategies generally begins when speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDuffy|Duffy]], pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages, AAC may consist of using an alphabet board to cue the listener to the first letter of the word being spoken, and may be used with those less familiar with the individual. In the later stages, AAC often becomes the main communicative method, although familiar conversation partners may still understand some spoken words.&lt;ref name="BS ALS Stages"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 445–447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since cognition and vision are typically unaffected in ALS, writing-based systems are preferred to graphic symbols, as they allow the unlimited expression of all words in a language.&lt;ref name="BS ALS Stages"/&gt;

The method of access to a communication device depends on the type and severity of the disease. In the spinal form of ALS, the limbs are affected from the onset of the disease; in these cases a head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially.&lt;ref name="MathyALS"&gt;[[#refMathy2000|Mathy]], p 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[bulbar]] form, speech is affected before the limbs; here handwriting and typing on keyboard-style devices are frequently the first forms of AAC.&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"/&gt; AAC users may change access methods as the disease progresses.  Low-tech systems, such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning, are used in situations when electronic devices are unavailable (for example, during bathing) and in the final stages of the disease.&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"/&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
[[File:dynawrite.jpg|right|thumb|alt= a communication device resembling a computer keyboard with a small liquid-crystal display attached to the top| Keyboard text-to-speech generating device for literate users with adequate fine motor control]][[Parkinson's disease]] is a progressive neurological condition&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;[[#refArmstrong2000|Armstrong]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[dysarthria]] may develop later in the progression of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDuffy|Duffy]], p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; A portable amplifier, for example, may be used to increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the [[tremor]] typical of the disease.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTjaden2008|Tjaden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple sclerosis===
Dysarthria is the most common communication problem in individuals with [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 448–449.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelman1985|Beukelman (1985)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of [[intention tremor]], and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 449–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dementia===
[[Dementia]] is an acquired, chronic, cognitive impairment
characterized by deficits in memory and other cognitive domains.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar" /&gt;&lt;ref name=friedoken&gt;[[#refFriedOken2009|Fried-Oken (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Communication impairments are partly attributed to memory deficits,&lt;ref name="friedoken" /&gt; and AAC intervention may be used to compensate for deficits and to capitalize on the person's strengths, such as the ability to recognize material they cannot recall.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"&gt;[[#refGarrettLasker|Garrett &amp; Lasker]], pp. 508–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Low-tech devices are generally preferred, such as memory books that include autobiographical information, daily schedules, photographs, and reminders or labels.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"/&gt; Several studies have shown positive outcomes in the amount of on-topic conversation and the length of interaction with these approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrewsSalvia2003|Andrews-Salvia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBourgeois1993|Bourgeois (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bourgeois&gt;[[#refBourgeois2001|Bourgeois (2001)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The gains were maintained four months after the training in the use of the memory aids had ceased.&lt;ref name=bourgeois/&gt; High-tech devices with voice output have been found to be less effective; in one study devices resulted in limited topic elaboration/initiation, reduced output and heightened distraction.&lt;ref name="friedoken" /&gt; AAC is also used to enhance the comprehension of those with dementia. The use of augmented listening strategies, such as identifying topics of conversation with pictures, improves the conversational skills of individuals with dementia.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lengua de Signos (Juan Pablo Bonet, 1620) A.jpg|thumb|upright|right| alt=a scan of the cover of a historic book, it shows some Spanish text and a drawing of a hand forming a sign| A page from a 1620 Spanish treatise on [[finger spelling]]]]
The history of AAC can be traced to the days of [[classical Rome]] and [[Classical Greece|Greece]], with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the [[deaf]].&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zangari"&gt;[[#refZangari|Zangari]].&lt;/ref&gt; The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name = "vanD"&gt;[[#refVanderheide|Vanderheiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Patient Operated Selector Mechanism.jpg|alt= a black and white photograph showing a user sitting in front of a modified typewrite, there is grid of letters above the typewriter that appear to be lighting up in sequence, a tube goes from the users mouth to the machine|thumb|upright|right|The Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s.]]
The modern era of AAC began in the 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several societal changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hourcade2004"&gt;[[#refHourcade2004|Hourcade]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, AAC was primarily used with [[laryngectomy]] and [[glossectomy]] cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;[[#refWilkinsonHennig|Wilkinson &amp; Hennig]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

From the 1960s onward, sign language increased in acceptance and use in the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], and AAC also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"/&gt; Manual sign languages, such as [[Makaton]], were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive impairments, and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal hearing.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt; Research into whether [[primate]]s could learn to sign or use graphic symbols spurred further interest the use of AAC with those with cognitive impairments.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"&gt;[[#refMirenda2009page5-9|Mirenda]] pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[Plains Indian Sign Language|Amer-Ind hand signals]] opened the field to AAC techniques specifically for adult users.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

[[Blissymbols]] were first used in Canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By the end of the 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt; Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

The late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of AAC-related research, publications, and training as well the first national and international conferences.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; The [[International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication]] (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since played an important role in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p10"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;
{{Quote box
| quote = "Knowing that most of y'all do not know the HandiVoice, I will describe it...It was operated with a numeric keyboard...Each word, or sentence, or phrase, or phoneme was stored and accessed by a three digit code, for example, "hello" was 010...It took three codes to say "Rick", that was nine numbers. Now if you think that's bad, let's go for the simple sentence, "Hello, this is Rick Creech speaking." This would have taken fifteen 3 digit codes, for a total of forty-five numbers. Looking back, I am not surprised that very few professionals thought a person could successfully use the HandiVoice 120. But I did. I did, because being able to communicate with people was so empowering to me."

From the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and [[Ewe language|Ewe]].&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

The 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society .&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; In schools, students with [[special needs]] were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom with the teacher, rather than in a therapy room.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; [[Facilitated communication]] – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field.  The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt; As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt;

Rapid progress in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] development continued, including projects funded by the [[European Community]]. The first commercially available [[Speech generating device#Dynamic display devices|dynamic screen speech generating devices]] were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight,&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some can be used as [[environmental control device]]s for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRobitaille|Robitaille]], pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Future directions for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing the cognitive and linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLightdrager|Light &amp; Drager]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The rapid advances in [[smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]] technologies has the potential to radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#McNaughtonLight2013|McNaughton &amp; Light, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users.&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;[[#refCook|Cook]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=higginbotham2&gt;[[#refHigginbotham|Higginbotham &amp; Jacobs]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and other [[open source]] operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required.&lt;ref name=higginbotham2/&gt; Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using [[speech recognition]] systems.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="red"&gt;[[#red|Reddington &amp; Tintarev]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural language generation]] techniques have been investigated,&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;[[#refNewell|Newell]], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black"&gt;[[#black|Black et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ashraf|Ashraf et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; data from a user's schedule&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt; and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="webcrawler"&gt;[[#Luowebcrawler|Luo et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as information about location from [[global positioning systems]] and other sensors.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#patel|Patel &amp; Radhakrishnan]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".&lt;ref name="cook"/&gt;

It is a collecting, publishing and research institute and is considered to be Australia's premier resource for information about the cultures and societies of [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''Submission to the review of AIATSIS'', Marcia Langton, http://www.acilallen.com.au/cms_files/25.%20Marcia%20Langton.pdf, retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS)'', National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation website, http://www.naccho.org.au/members/listings/australian-institute-of-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-studies-aiatsis/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226052657/http://www.naccho.org.au/members/listings/australian-institute-of-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-studies-aiatsis/ |date=26 February 2015 }}, retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'50 years of collecting, protecting and sharing Indigenous culture at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies', Louise Maher, ''ABC News'', 17 July 2014, http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-17/aiatsis-50th/5601154&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is a leader in ethical research&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies'', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Values and Ethics – Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research'', National Health and Medical Research Council website, https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/e52, retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and the handling of culturally sensitive material&lt;ref name=ATSILIRN&gt;‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN) Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services’, http://atsilirn.aiatsis.gov.au/protocols.php, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Development Policy 2013 – 2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-development-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and holds in its collections many unique and irreplaceable items of cultural, historical and spiritual significance.&lt;ref&gt;''A better deal for AIATSIS, Site of Pilgrimage'', Significance International website, http://www.significanceinternational.com/AboutUs/News/newsid394/77/AIATSIS-seeks-a-better-deal.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226074521/http://www.significanceinternational.com/AboutUs/News/newsid394/77/AIATSIS-seeks-a-better-deal.aspx |date=26 February 2015 }}, retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection at AIATSIS has been built through over 50 years of research and engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and is now a source of language and culture revitalisation, native title research and family and community history.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS', Australian National University website, http://www.deepeninghistories.anu.edu.au/aiatsis/, retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS is located on [[Acton Peninsula]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]].

==History==

===The proposal and interim council (1959–1964)===


In the late 1950s, there was an increasing focus on the global need for anthropological research into 'disappearing cultures'.&lt;ref&gt;''International Social Science Bulletin: Disappearing Cultures'', vol 9, No 3, 1957, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000247/024733eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heine-Geldern, R (1959), 'The International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research', ''American Anthropologist'', 61: 1076–1078. doi: 10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00130&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was also emerging in Australia in the work of researchers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, RM (1959), ‘Areas of research in Aboriginal Australia which demand urgent attention’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol. 2, pp 63–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehlow, TGH (1959), ‘Anthropological and ethnological research in Australia’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol 2, pp 70–5&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a proposal by [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth MP]] for the conception of an Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75"&gt;Mulvaney, DJ (2008), 'WEH Stanner and the foundation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1959–1964', p 58-75, in: ''An Appreciation of Difference: WEH Stanner and Aboriginal Australia'', Hinkson, Melinda and Beckett, Jeremy (eds), Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was made as a submission to Cabinet,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Aborigines, film and science’, ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a more comprehensive approach by the Australian Government to the recording of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"&gt;'Wentworth Lectures', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/news-and-events/events/special-events/wentworth-lectures, retrieved 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a Cabinet sub-committee assessed the proposal&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988"&gt;Chapman, Valerie (1988), 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies', ''Resources for Australian Studies in the ACT'', Biskup, Peter &amp; Goodman, Doreen (eds), Centre for Library and Information Studies, CCAE, pp194-214&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a working party at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to consider the viability of the proposal.  One of their first actions was to appoint [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; to be held in 1961 at the ANU.

Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, H (ed) 1963, ''Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; No Aboriginal people were present at the conference.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]] appointed an Interim Council in 1961.  The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA"&gt;'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall,&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"&gt;'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316112934/http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals |date=16 March 2015 }}, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected. The Interim Council completed a revised constitution in July 1963. Amendments to the document included the change from the title ‘director’ to ‘principal’ of the institute.

This version of the constitution would go on to form the basis for the creation of the new Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies the following year.&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

===AIAS early years (1964–1970)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established as a [[Statutory authority]]&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Independent Review', ''Final Report to the Department of Education'', May 2014, p (i), http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/review-of-aiatsis-full-report-2014.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under an Act of Parliament in June 1964.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;'Our history', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/our-history, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Interim Council for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia website, www.naa.gov.au,  retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute at that time has been described as "to record language, song, art, material culture, ceremonial life and social structure before those traditions perished in the face of European ways."&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"&gt;Mulvaney, D. J. 'Reflections', ''Antiquity'', Vol. 80, no. 308, June 2006, pp 425–434, http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/080/0425/ant0800425.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also reflected in the Institute’s official functions, as recorded in the Reading of the Bill in Parliament. These were:

:(a)	to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines.

:(b)	to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing.

:(c)	to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education.

:(d)	to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies.

:(e)	to publish and to support the publication of the results of research.

:(f)	to co-operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records.

:(g)	to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers.

:(h)	to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt;

AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; The founding Principal of the newly formed institute was [[Frederick McCarthy]],&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"/&gt; a professional anthropologist and graduate of Sydney University who had spent nearly 30 years working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;'Fred McCarthy: the founding principal of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, {{cite web |url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028055915/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

The Institute’s founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film Unit&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit’ , ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and championing ethnographic film in global forums.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;

In the early years of the AIAS, the Film Unit largely outsourced early filmmaking work to other companies,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002" /&gt; or worked in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (as early as 1962).&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But over the next 30 years, the Film Unit would go on to produce “one of the largest assembly of ethnographic films created in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS Collections: Film', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/film, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the AIAS official function “to publish and to support the publication of the results of research”,&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt; a publishing arm of the Institute was established in 1964. Publishing under the name Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the publishing arm released a range of papers and research findings, including in the fields of linguistics, demography, physical anthropology, history and musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, AP, 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies: Publications', in Oceania, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Sep. 1970), pp. 52–57, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329899, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The early work of the AIAS is credited with increasing interaction between academics in different fields, as well as establishing the foundations for the extensive collections AIATSIS holds today. But before 1970, there had never been an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander member on the AIAS Council.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===Self-determination and the Institute (1970–1989)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Money and other resources are in short supply for Aboriginal control of their livelihood, but not, it seems, for discussing it."'' – Eaglehawk and Crow letter, 29 March 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 1970s marked a period of change for the AIAS. This began with the appointment of the first Aboriginal member of the AIAS Council in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Jacqueline, ''A History of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 1959 -1989: An analysis of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people achieved control of a national research institute'', thesis submitted for the Doctor of Philosophy, Menzies Library, Australian National University, November 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Roberts, an Alawa man,&lt;ref&gt;‘Indigenous Rights: Phillip Roberts’, National Museum of Australia website, http://www.nma.gov.au/indigenous/people/pagination/phillip_roberts, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilling, A. R. (1963), '‘I, the Aboriginal’, Douglas Lockwood', ''American Anthropologist'', 65: 1152–1153. doi: 10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00280&lt;/ref&gt; served on the Council from September 1970 until June 1972.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"&gt;Lambert 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in 1971 with a second Aboriginal Council member, [[Neville Bonner|Senator Neville Bonner]], who served on Council until 1974 and for a second term in the late 1970s. And again in 1972, with the appointment of [[Dick Roughsey]] to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"/&gt; But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Widders, Thompson, Bellear &amp; Watson (1974), ''Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies'', 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p107&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal rights movement was growing&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people.&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected. Their policy of [[Self-determination of Australian Aborigines|Self-determination for Aboriginal people]] echoed calls for greater Aboriginal involvement in the administration and functions of the AIAS.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, Mitchell &amp; Johnson, Murray, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines'', Scarecrow Press, Maryland, 2011, p xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;Pratt, Angela, 'Make or Break? A Background to the ATSIC Changes and the ATSIC Review', Parliament of Australia website, http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03cib29, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was also responsible for a significant boost to AIAS funding.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), Recording culture in transition, Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 52–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Peter Ucko in 1972 as Principal of the AIAS has since been described as the beginning of an increase in involvement of Aboriginal people in the workings of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary"&gt;Shennan, Stephen, ‘Peter Ucko Obituary’, The Guardian, 9 July 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In his time as Principal, Ucko was responsible for implementing a policy later labelled “Aboriginalisation”, which was aimed at opening up the Institute to Aboriginal involvement and representation.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995"&gt;Moser, Stephanie, ‘The Aboriginalisation of Archaeology’, in Ucko, Peter J (ed) Theory in Archaeology: A World Perspective, Routledge, London, 1995, p152&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was influenced by a document circulated in 1974, called the Eaglehawk and Crow letter, which criticised the current model of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, John (2011), Digging Up the Past, University of NSW Press, Sydney, p186&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted that anthropologists "should not pretend that their studies are objective when the overwhelming factor in the lives of Aborigines is our oppression by the society of which the anthropologist is, to a greater or lesser extent, a part of." Its authors called for increased participation of Aboriginal people in the running of the Institute and for greater control over commissioning and funding of research into their cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Widder, T et al, ''Open Letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, ''referred to as the "Eaglehawk and Crow letter", 29 March 1974, http://www.50yearjourney.aiatsis.gov.au/stage4/_media/eaglehawk_and_crow_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy and structural changes to the Institute continued throughout the 1970s.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995" /&gt; The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975–1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of ‘cultural practitioner’, travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of “rapid expansion”&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary" /&gt; for the Institute.

The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born [[ethnographic film]]maker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

During the MacDougall/McKenzie era, a new style of ethnographic film was explored.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO"&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One that moved away from film as a scientific record in favour of telling the story of individuals lives.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant ‘voice of god’ narration style.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was ''Waiting for Harry'', a prize-winning film&lt;ref&gt;‘'Waiting for Harry’', Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024103/https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry |date=29 November 2014 }}, retrieved 11 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Kim McKenzie with [[anthropologist]] [[Les Hiatt]] and now considered to exemplify the "style of collaborative filmmaking" the Film Unit favoured in their work.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;

The power of film to "influence opinion"&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic [[Marcia Langton]] expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] for his role in establishing the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The lecture is presented by prominent person with knowledge or experience relating to issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia today.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"/&gt;

The expansion of the Institute continued into the 1980s. The Aboriginal Studies Press began publishing the Australian Aboriginal Studies Journal in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Australian aboriginal studies: journal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Deaking University Library, http://encore.deakin.edu.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2865270, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed journal aimed at  “promoting high-quality research in Australian Indigenous studies.”&lt;ref name="ASJ"&gt;‘Australian Aboriginal Studies online’, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/australian-aboriginal-studies-journal, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the AIAS established a task force that identified the prevailing need for further ‘Aboriginalisation’ of the Institute’s workforce. At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p280&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

The ‘After 200 Years’ project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.&lt;ref name="After 200 Years"&gt;Taylor, Penny.

The Rock Art Protection Program (RAPP) commenced in 1986 following a request for such an initiative by the then Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Clyde Holding]]. The aim of the RAPP was to protect Australian Indigenous rock art. Grants were approved by the Institute to fund various projects related to rock art protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ward. Graeme K, 'The role of AIATSIS in research and protection of Australian rock art', in: ''Rock Art Research''. Vol 28, no. 1 (May 2011), p 7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections were also expanding, and by 1987 the AIATSIS library encompassed the print collections, a special Bibliographic Section and the Resource Centre (which contained the Institute’s audiovisual materials).&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, the survival of the AIAS as an independent statutory body was tied to a proposal for a new statutory commission that would take over all aspects of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, pp288-308&lt;/ref&gt; This commission would become the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), conceived in an Act of Parliament in 1989.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kingsley, 'ATSIC: Origins and Issues for the Future’, A Critical Review of Public Domain Research and Other Materials, AIATSIS Research Discussion Paper # 12, 2004, p5, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/discussion_paper/palmerk-dp12-atsic-origins-issues-future-research.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The AIAS would not be folded into this commission; instead it would be recreated under a new Act with a new name.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

[[File:The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS).JPG|thumb|right|The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS)]]
[[File:Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015.JPG|thumb|right|Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015]]
AIATSIS publishes the Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (referred to as GERAIS),&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a document considered to be the leading ethics guidelines for conducting research in and with Indigenous communities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, ''Writing up Indigenous research: authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge systems'',Terri Janke and Co, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines consist of 14 principles. These principles broadly fit under the following themes:

*rights, respect and recognition
*negotiation, consultation, agreement and mutual understanding
*participation, collaboration and partnership
*benefits, outcomes and giving back
*managing research: use, storage and access, and
*reporting and compliance&lt;ref name="EthicsMedia"&gt;‘Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is required reading for researchers applying for Ethical Clearance for research sponsored by AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="EthicsApplication"&gt;‘Application process’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/application-process, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, Writing up Indigenous research:  authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge system, Terri Janke and Co, 2009, p15&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guidelines are also intended by AIATSIS to inform all research in the field of Indigenous studies.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;

Originally published by AIATSIS in 2000, the latest version of the GERAIS document was published in 2012. This update was made to reflect legal and technological developments that had occurred since original publication. In particular, in the area of intellectual property and the rights of Indigenous people in their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions as well as progress in digitisation technologies and data and information management.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=EthicsMedia /&gt;

These changes reflect AIATSIS’ support for the importance of research projects involving appropriate ethical conduct and rights protection for both the way data is collected during research and the findings and materials generated through that research.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. ''Bringing ethics up to date: a review of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ethical guidelines''. In: Australian Aboriginal Studies. no. 2,2010, p. 10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is the first point of reference in the ethical review process researchers must undergo before AIATSIS will sponsor a research project. All research projects are reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee for approval, using the following project documents:

*an ethical clearance proposal, using the GERAIS document as a guide,
*a plain English statement to explain to participants what the project is and how it will be conducted, and
*informed consent forms, that are completed by participants of the research.&lt;ref name=EthicsApplication /&gt;

In 2013, AIATSIS was involved in the review of two [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] research ethics guidelines relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research.&lt;ref&gt;'Evaluation of NHMRC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research Ethics', The Lowitja Institute website, http://www.lowitja.org.au/nhmrc-research-ethics, 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Title research===
AIATSIS began undertaking Native Title research activities through the Native Title Research Unit in 1993, following the 1992 [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]] [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] decision. Native Title research at AIATSIS is primarily funded through the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]&lt;ref name="NT main"&gt;'Native title and traditional ownership', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but research has also been conducted in partnership with other departments and organisations including the [[Australian National University]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Federal Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership partners', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/partners, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Title Research Advisory Committee, the Research Advisory Committee and the AIATSIS Council oversee the work conducted in Native Title and traditional ownership research at AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt;

AIATSIS conducts a range of research projects relating to Native Title and traditional ownership, including Native Title and cultural heritage, Native Title and fresh and sea water, and Prescribed Body Corporates.&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership current projects', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/current, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Native Title research at AIATSIS is to monitor outcomes of Native Title and through research and study, provide advice on Native Title policy development.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt; The Institute publishes a range of materials relating to Native Title including books, discussion papers, research reports and a Native Title Newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;‘About NTRU Publications’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title-and-traditional-ownership/native-title-and-traditional-ownership-resources-and-information-services, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Native Title Corporations’, http://www.nativetitle.org.au/research.html, retrieved 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Overview===
AIATSIS is the only Commonwealth institution responsible for collecting and maintaining materials documenting the oral and visual traditions and histories of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; The Institute identifies its collection as a “keeping place for culturally significant objects” that is “a resource for anybody looking to improve their knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's holdings represent thousands of years of history and more than 500 Australian Indigenous languages, dialects and groups. This collection supports, and is a result of, research in the fields of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

An independent assessment in 2014 confirmed that AIATSIS holds over 6 million feet of film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; over 40,000 hours of audio, 12,800 unpublished manuscripts and record series, 653,000 photographs, and 120,000 print and published materials (3,000 of which are rare books) among other miscellanea.&lt;ref&gt;’50 years of culture and collections’, 15 December 2014, http://www.indigenous.gov.au/news-and-media/stories/50-years-culture-and-collections&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of items within the AIATSIS collection that have been both nationally and internationally recognised as significant:

The Audiovisual Archives also holds copies of the first audio recorded in Australia;&lt;ref&gt;‘Musical Connections: The Life and Work of Alice Moyle, AIATSIS Online Exhibition, http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320123750/http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html |date=20 March 2015 }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a series of ethnographic wax cylinder recordings made in the Torres Strait Islands in 1898.  The Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Strait, led by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], recorded songs and speech from Mer/Murray Island, Mabuiag/Jervis Island, Saibai Island, Tudu Island and Iama/Yam Island.

The AIATSIS collection is housed and managed through the Library and the Audiovisual Archive,&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"&gt;Barbara Lewincamp &amp; Julie Faulkner (2003) 'A keyhole to the collection: the AIATSIS Library Digitisation Pilot Program’, ‘’The Australian Library Journal’’, 52:3, 239–245, DOI: 10.1080/00049670.2003.10721551&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadly categorised into the following groups:

'''Art and artefact:''' a collection of items including ritual objects, folk art, children’s art and modern or ‘high art’ and span from the late 19th century to the present day.

[[File:Colour slides from the Wright collection containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art.jpg|thumb|left|Colour slides from the Wright collection (WRIGHT.B02.CS) containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art]]
'''Manuscripts and rare books:''' a collection of more than 11,700 manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections Highlights’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 2,600 rare books dating from 1766,&lt;ref&gt;Callander, John, ‘’Terra australis cognita, or, Voyages to the Terra australis’’, Printed for the author and sold by Messrs Hawes, Clark, and Collins, in Pater-noster-Row, London, 1766–1768, call number RB C156.25/T1, AIATSIS library catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; 2,200 rare pamphlets and 1,700 rare serial titles consisting of 14,650 issues held in secure, environmentally controlled storage. Items are included in this classification on the basis of their age, rarity, value or sensitivity of the content for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Among these items are the Sorry Books and the [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|WEH Stanner]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;'Manuscripts and rare books', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/manuscripts-and-rare-books, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial:''' this collection contains roughly 650,000 photographs that date from modern day as far back as the late 1800s, and more than 90% of images in the pictorial collection are unique to AIATSIS, making it the most comprehensive record of its kind relating to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictorial’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound:''' a collection of many unique and unpublished sound recordings totalling approximately 40,000 hours of audio.

===Acquisitions===
Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items.

AIATSIS’ approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria:

:1.	Comprehensiveness – the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. 
:2.	Significance – items that meet this criteria are considered to make ‘a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge’, reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS’ own history. 
:3.	Representativeness – when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are ‘representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.’&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

===Collection management===
Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting.

Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways:

:1.	Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013–2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management-plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
:2.	Storage of collection items in climate-controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.&lt;ref&gt;‘Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.&lt;ref name="Caring collection"&gt;‘Caring for the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning.jpg|thumb|An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning]]Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records’, Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May-June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Electronic Records – Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria’, VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure.

The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.&lt;ref&gt;‘Using the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its founding Act,&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN).&lt;ref name="ATSILIRN" /&gt; Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.&lt;ref name="CAUP"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digitisation program===
AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution.&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"/&gt;

Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan,&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt; but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnsley, Warren, 'AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still "inadequate"', '’National Indigenous Radio Service'’, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding-welcome-but-still-inadequate.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raggatt, Matthew, ‘Historic indigenous collection in "severe and catastrophic state"’, ‘’The Canberra Times’’, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection-in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caring collection" /&gt; One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

===Access to the collection===
[[File:Library stacks at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra ACT Australia.tif|thumb|left|Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia]]
The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters.

Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.&lt;ref&gt;'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations  to access.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating “remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities” as well as for access by researchers and the general public.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS’ digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.&lt;ref&gt;‘Return of materials to Indigenous communities’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous-communities, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to the AIATSIS collection is also dictated by legislation governing the Institute and in some instances by legal agreements outlining the terms under which collection materials can be used.

The terms for access to the AIATSIS collection are in the first instance set by the AIATSIS Act, Section 41. This section states:

:1.	"Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions.
:2.	The Institute or the Council shall not disclose information or other matter held by it (including information or other matter covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders."&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions referred to in Section 41(1) of the AIATSIS Act are usually covered in the agreement that AIATSIS enters into when material is deposited. These agreements, along with the section 41(2) of the Act, can govern the way that unpublished material can be accessed and used.&lt;ref name=CAUP /&gt;

Access to and use of material in the AIATSIS collection is also subject to the terms set out in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act (1968)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ordering collection items', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/ordering-collection-items, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When a donation or deposit is being made, AIATSIS requests to be made aware of any sensitive items included in the material.&lt;ref&gt;‘Donate to the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/donate-collection, retrieved 12  March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The secret or sacred nature of information contained in many collection items is an important factor in access to the AIATSIS collection. To protect items of high cultural sensitivity and reflect appropriate cultural values, access to items that contain culturally sensitive information are restricted to groups or individuals who have the permission of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and the depositor if restrictions have been applied by them.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 7, 9, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also acknowledges the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and in particular Article 31's recognition of the right of Indigenous people to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations, 2000, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these complex issues AIATSIS developed an overarching Access and Use Policy in 2014, to “manage legal and cultural rights over material while maximising accessibility.”&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2013-2014, p42, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/aiatsis-annual-report-2013-2014, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection resources===
Since its inception, AIATSIS has developed and maintained a range of resources to enhance discoverability of the collection.

One of the most significant of these resources is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index (ABI). The ABI had its beginnings in 1979 as a non-selective biographical register of names, constructed using information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from published material in the collection. In the early years of the biographical register, it was hoped it could “provide an important record of the achievements of Aboriginal people, and be a source of pride for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Laurie and Barwick, Diane. Beginning a national Aboriginal biographical register at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Aboriginal history. Vol. 6 pt. 2, 1982. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the index continues to be updated, now containing over 70,000 records and searchable online through AIATSIS’ collection catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/guides-and-resources/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-biographical-index, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other resources available on site include the Perfect Pictures Database, which contains over 140,000 digitised images from the AIATSIS Photographic Collection. This database is added to as more images are digitised and only includes images that are free of secret/sacred access restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictures database’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial/pictures-database, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also hosts or contributes to a number of online resources, aimed at facilitating access to and understanding of the collection. These include:

*'''Mura''' – this is AIATSIS’ collection catalogue, which can be searched online.&lt;ref&gt;‘Search the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/search-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trove''' – the AIATSIS collection can be searched through the National Library of Australia’s Trove.&lt;ref&gt;‘Introduction to Trove’ video, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/guides-and-resources/Tutorial-Introduction-to-Trove.swf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS uses this platform as a means to further enhancing discoverability of and access to its collections.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Agency resources and planned performance’’, Department of Industry and Science website, http://www.industry.gov.au/AboutUs/Budget/Documents/PortfolioBudgetStatementsAIATSIS2011-12.pdf, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thesauri''' – there are three Thesauri that AIATSIS have created and make available through their website. These relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, place names and subject areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Pathways: Gateway to the AIATSIS Thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/thesaurus/language/language.asp, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Library of Congress has approved these thesauri for use in bibliographic records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pathways thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/pathways-thesauri, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the Institute==
[[File:Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra 2007.JPG|thumb|The west wing of the AIATSIS building designed by [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]], is a black replica of [[Le Corbusier]]'s iconic [[Villa Savoye]]]]

AIATSIS is located on the [[Acton Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;'Contact us', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/get-involved/contact-us, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a building that was newly built for the Institute and opened in 2001. The building was officially opened by the Honourable [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] and [[Ken Colbung|Mr Ken Colbung]]. As part of the opening the [[Ngunnawal people]], the traditional owners of the land on which the AIATSIS building stands performed a [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|Welcome to Country]] and [[smoking ceremony]], and the Anbarra people from North Central Arnhem Land performed a friendship ceremony, known as Rom.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"&gt;'AIATSIS finds a home', The Koori Mail, Issue 261, Wednesday 3 October 2001, p10, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/koori-mail/koori-mail-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, [[Howard Raggatt|Howard Ragatt]] of the firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall designed the building for AIATSIS and for its neighbour on the Acton Peninsula, the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p191&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $13.75 million and was funded by the Commonwealth Government’s Centenary of Federation Grants Program.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"/&gt;

The design of the AIATSIS building has been the subject of differing interpretations. The rear of the building has been described as a black copy of pioneer architect [[Le Corbusier]]'s 1920's [[Villa Savoye]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;'The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p198&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Howard Raggatt, was quoted as confirming this influence&lt;ref&gt;“Letters and Fixes: NMA, AIATSIS and Consultation”, Architecture Australia website, http://architectureau.com/articles/letters-and-fixes-6/, retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that it is designed to be reminiscent of [[Sidney Nolan]]'s famous paintings of Ned Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Dimitry (ed), National Museum of Australia: Tangled Destinies, Images Publishing, Victoria, 2002, p66&lt;/ref&gt;

During design of the AIATSIS building, it was reoriented from original plans to save two [[Eucalyptus bridgesiana|Apple Box trees]] that were identified as significant to the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Report relating to the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Parliament of Australia, 1998, p64&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''authority''' of a text is its reliability as a witness to the author's intentions. These intentions could be initial, medial or final, but intentionalist editors (most notably represented by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] editing school) generally attempt to retrieve final authorial intentions. The concept is of particular importance for textual critics, whether they believe that authorial intention is recoverable, or whether they think that this recovery is impossible. 

Here are some examples of authority:

* The only authority for the works of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Catullus]] derives from a lost manuscript, of which three copies reside in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris, the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome (the ''Codex Vaticanus''). No one knows, or can ever know, how close this manuscript comes to [[Catullus]]' intentions—in other words, how great its authority is.
* It is generally thought that the Q1 ('[[Bad quarto]]') edition of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an [[copyright infringement|unauthorized]] copy, reconstructed from memory by one of the actors. If this is so, then it has some authority, but much less than the first authorized quarto, Q2 (1602). In comparison, however, it might be a useful authority to the cuts and adaptations made in the performance it was based on.
* The [[First Folio]] edition of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1623) is the only authoritative source, since it is the copy-text of all future editions.
* A diary which is probably authentic has total authority.

A text's authority is made more problematic when it has more than one author, when it falsely asserts itself to be someone else's work, or when it is revised many times. For instance:

* The forged [[Hitler Diaries|diaries]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] have no authority as the work of their supposed author, but they do have authority as a witness to the intentions of [[Konrad Kujau]], the forger.
* A page on Wikipedia could be said to indicate the intentions of the aggregate of users who have edited it up to that point: it has multiple authority. But many of its editors will disagree with one another about what the page should contain. The idea of 'final intention' does not easily apply, since the page is never complete, and since a recent change (e.g. a piece of vandalism) might not be satisfactory to any of the other editors except the one who made it.
* The [[quarto]] edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]] differs from the later [[folio (printing)|folio]] edition in many ways. Most modern versions collate the two, preferring one edition in one passage and the other in another. But some editors, such as [[Stanley Wells]], argue they are separate works with different artistic intentions, and that neither of them has more authority.

Authority can also be related to a particular edition, especially if this edition reaches a degree of popularity.

'''Bahamian English''' is a variety of [[English language|English]] spoken in the [[Bahamas]] and by Bahamian diasporas. The standard for official use and education is [[British English|British]]-based.&lt;ref name=Sociolinguistics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ammon|first1=Ulrich|last2=Dittmar|first2=Norbert|last3=Mattheier|first3=Klaus J.|title=Sociolinguistics: An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&amp;pg=PA2069|year=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018418-1|page=2069|quote = British-based standard Bahamian English is the official language [...] Although standard Bahamian is non-rhotic, many Bahamians view r-full American pronunciations as "correct" and try to imitate them, even to the extent of introducing a [[hypercorrect]] /r/ in [...] ''Baharmas''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The realization of vowels in the Bahamian English. The vowels below are named by the [[lexical set]] they belong to:
*The [[KIT lexical set|Kit vowel]]: The same as in American English, the default {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
*The [[DRESS lexical set|Dress vowel]]: The vowel is {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.
*The Trap vowel: This vowel is mostly {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.
*The Lot vowel: As mostly of the US, this vowel is usually {{IPA|[ɑ]}}.
*The Strut vowel: It is the same as in the US English, {{IPA|[ʌ]}}.
*The Foot vowel: It is {{IPA|[ʊ]}}.
*The Fleece vowel: It is {{IPA|[i]}} or a diphthong {{IPA|[ɪi]}}.
*The Face [[diphthong]]: It is generally {{IPA|[eɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}.
*The Palm vowel: It is mostly {{IPA|[ɑ]}}.
*The Thought vowel: The vowel is {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.
*The Goat diphthong: It is generally {{IPA|[ɵʊ]}} or {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.
*The Near diphthong: It is {{IPA|[eə]}} or {{IPA|[iə]}}.
*The Square diphthong: It is {{IPA|[eə]}}.
*The Start vowel: It is {{IPA|[ɑː]}}.
*The North diphthong: usually {{IPA|[ɔə]}}.
*The Force diphthong: usually {{IPA|[oə]}}.
*The Cure diphthong: usually {{IPA|[uə]}}.
*The Bath vowel: This vowel is mostly {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.
*The Cloth vowel: It is mostly {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.
*The Nurse vowel: It varies among {{IPA|[ə]}}, {{IPA|[ɜ]}} and {{IPA|[ɜi]}}.
*The Goose vowel: It is mostly {{IPA|[ʉː]}}.
*The Price/Prize Dithphong: It's generally {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}}.
*The Choice diphthong: It is {{IPA|[oɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}}.
*The Mouth diphthong: It varies among {{IPA|[ao]}}, {{IPA|[aɵ]}} {{IPA|[aɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑə]}}.
*The happY vowel: It is pretty much the ''kit'' vowel: {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
*The lettEr-horsEs-commA vowel is {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]).

There is poor distinction between the {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} sounds in Bahamian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=Becky|last2=Wolfram|first2=Walt|editor1-last=Schneider|editor1-first=Edgar W.|title=Varieties of English |volume= 2: The Americas and the Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=239–255|chapter=Bahamian English: phonology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast is often [[neutralization (linguistics)|neutralize]]d or merged into {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[b]}} or {{IPA|[β]}}, so ''village'' sounds like {{IPA|[wɪlɪdʒ]}}, {{IPA|[vɪlɪdʒ]}} or {{IPA|[βɪlɪdʒ]}}. This also happens in the [[Vincentian English|Vincentian]], [[Bermudian English|Bermudian]] and other [[Caribbean English]]es.

[[Dental fricative]]s are usually changed to [[alveolar plosive]]s ([[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]]):
* Voiced ''th'' becomes /d/, e.g. "That" turns into "dat"; "Those" &gt; "Dose"; "There" &gt; "Dere"; "They" &gt; "Dey".
* Unvoiced ''th'' becomes /t/, e.g. "Thanks" becomes "tanks"; "Throw" &gt; "Trow"; "Three" &gt; "Tree".

'''Chuvansky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Чуванский язык) is an extinct [[Yukaghir language]] of [[Siberia]], part of a [[dialect continuum]] with the two surviving languages&lt;ref&gt;Tailleur  O. G., Le dialecte tchouvane du youkaghir, "Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher", Wiesbaden, 1962, Bd 34.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was most likely last spoken in the 18th century. Chuvansky was widespread in the lower region of the [[Anadyr River]] (near [[Chuvanskoye]]), spoken by [[Chuvans]]. The translations of 22 sentences, recorded in [[1781]] by I. Benzig, and 210 words written by [[Fyodor Matyushkin|FF Matyushkin]] have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Matyushkin  FF, Collection of the words of the Chuvansky and Omok languages, in: Vrangel  F.P., Journey through the northern shores of Siberia and along the Arctic Ocean, accomplished in 1820-1824, Part 2, Additions, St. Petersburg, 1841 ;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code-mixing''' is the mixing of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in speech.{{efn|Although this article uses the terms ''speech'' and ''speaking'' following common practice in linguistics, these descriptions apply equally to [[Sign language|signed languages]].}}

Some scholars use the terms "code-mixing" and "[[code-switching]]" interchangeably, especially in studies of [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and other [[Formalism (philosophy)|formal]] aspects of language.&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"&gt;Muysken, Pieter. 2000. ''Bilingual Speech: A Typology of Code-mixing''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokamba&gt;Bokamba, Eyamba G. 1989. Are there syntactic constraints on code-mixing? World Englishes, 8(3), 277-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Others assume more specific definitions of code-mixing, but these specific definitions may be different in different subfields of [[linguistics]], [[education theory]], [[Communications#Communication as academic discipline|communications]] etc.

Code-mixing is similar to the use or creation of [[pidgin]]s; but while a pidgin is created across groups that do not share a common language, code-mixing may occur within a [[multilingual]] setting where speakers share more than one language.

==As code-switching==
{{main|Code-switching}}
Some linguists use the terms code-mixing and code-switching more or less interchangeably. Especially in formal studies of syntax, morphology, etc., both terms are used to refer to [[utterance]]s that draw from elements of two or more [[Grammar|grammatical systems]].&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"/&gt; These studies are often interested in the alignment of elements from distinct systems, or on constraints that limit switching. 

Some work defines code-mixing as the placing or mixing of various linguistic units (affixes, words, phrases, clauses) from two different grammatical systems within the same sentence and speech context, while code-switching is the placing or mixing of units (words, phrases, sentences) from two codes within the same speech context. The structural difference between code-switching and code-mixing is the position of the altered elements—for code-switching, the modification of the codes occurs intersententially, while for code-mixing, it occurs intrasententially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BOKAMBA|first1=Eyamba G.|title=CODE-MIXING, LANGUAGE VARIATION, AND LINGUISTIC THEORY: Evidence from Bantu Languages|journal=Lingua|date=February 1988|volume=76, Issue 1|pages=21-62|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384188900174|accessdate=10 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(88)90017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work the term code-switching emphasizes a multilingual speaker's movement from one grammatical system to another, while the term code-mixing suggests a hybrid form, drawing from distinct grammars. In other words, ''code-mixing'' emphasizes the formal aspects of language structures or [[linguistic competence]], while ''code-switching'' emphasizes [[linguistic performance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

While many linguists have worked to describe the difference between code-switching and [[Loanword|borrowing]] of words or phrases, the term code-mixing may be used to encompass both types of language behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|first=Shana|last=Poplack|title=Code switching (linguistic)|editors=N. J. Smelser &amp; B. Baltes|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=2062-2065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sociolinguistics==
While linguists who are primarily interested in the structure or form of code-mixing may have relatively little interest to separate code-mixing from code-switching, some sociolinguists have gone to great lengths to differentiate the two phenomena. For these scholars, code-switching is associated with particular [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects, [[discourse]] functions, or associations with group [[Identity (social science)|identity]].{{efn|See especially [[Code-switching#Social motivations|Social motivations for code-switching]].}} In this tradition, the terms ''code-mixing'' or ''language alternation'' are used to describe more stable situations in which multiple languages are used without such pragmatic effects. See also [[#As fused lect|Code-mixing as fused lect]], below.

==In language acquisition==
In studies of bilingual [[language acquisition]], ''code-mixing'' refers to a developmental stage during which children mix elements of more than one language. Nearly all bilingual children go through a period in which they move from one language to another without apparent discrimination.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Kendall A. 2006. "Child language acquisition." In R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds.) ''An Introduction to Language and Linguistics''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from code-switching, which is understood as the socially and grammatically appropriate use of multiple varieties.

Beginning at the [[babbling]] stage, young children in bilingual or multilingual environments produce utterances that combine elements of both (or all) of their developing languages. Some linguists suggest that this code-mixing reflects a lack of control or ability to differentiate the languages. Others argue that it is a product of limited vocabulary; very young children may know a word in one language but not in another. More recent studies argue that this early code-mixing is a demonstration of a developing ability to code-switch in socially appropriate ways.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;

For young bilingual children, code-mixing may be dependent on the linguistic context, cognitive task demands, and interlocutor. Code-mixing may also function to fill gaps in their lexical knowledge. Some forms of code-mixing by young children may indicate risk for [[Language disorder|language impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Kai J |author2=Elizabeth D Peña |author3=Lisa M Bedore|title=Lexical choice and language selection in bilingual preschoolers|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=1|pages=27–39|doi=10.1177/0265659012459743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology and psycholinguistics==
In [[psychology]] and in [[psycholinguistics]] the label ''code-mixing'' is used in theories that draw on studies of language alternation or code-switching to describe the cognitive structures underlying bilingualism. During the 1950s and 1960s, psychologists and linguists treated bilingual speakers as, in Grosjean's term, "two monolinguals in one person".&lt;ref name="Grosjean"&gt;Grosjean, Francois. 1989. Neurolinguists, beware! The bilingual is not two monolinguals in one person. Brain language 36(1):3-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This "fractional view" supposed that a bilingual speaker carried two separate mental grammars that were more or less identical to the mental grammars of monolinguals and that were ideally kept separate and used separately. Studies since the 1970s, however, have shown that bilinguals regularly combine elements from "separate" languages. These findings have led to studies of code-mixing in psychology and psycholinguistics.&lt;ref name="Sridhar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sridhar | first1 = S.N. | last2 = Sridhar | first2 = Kamal K. | year = 1980 | title = The syntax and psycholinguistics of bilingual code-mixing | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 407–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sridhar and Sridhar define code-mixing as "the transition from using linguistic units (words, phrases, clauses, etc.) of one language to using those of another within a single sentence".&lt;ref name="Sridhar"/&gt; They note that this is distinct from code-switching in that it occurs in a single sentence (sometimes known as ''intrasentential switching'') and in that it does not fulfill the pragmatic or discourse-oriented functions described by sociolinguists. (See [[#In sociolinguistics|Code-mixing in sociolinguistics]], above.) The practice of code-mixing, which draws from competence in two languages at the same time suggests that these competences are not stored or processed separately. Code-mixing among bilinguals is therefore studied in order to explore the mental structures underlying language abilities.

==As fused lect== &lt;!-- [[Code-switching]] links here --&gt;
A ''[[mixed language]]'' or a ''fused lect'' is a relatively stable mixture of two or more languages. What some linguists have described as "codeswitching as unmarked choice"&lt;ref name="Scotton1993"&gt;Myers-Scotton, Carol. 1993. ''Social Motivations of Codeswitching''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "frequent codeswitching"&lt;ref name="Poplack1979"&gt;Poplack, Shana. 1979. Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espanol: toward a typology of code-switching. Linguistics 18(233-234): 581-618.&lt;/ref&gt; has more recently been described as "language mixing", or in the case of the most strictly [[Grammaticalisation|grammaticalized]] forms as "fused lects".&lt;ref name="Auer1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = Peter | year = 1999 | title = From code-switching via language mixing to fused lects: toward a dynamic typology of bilingual speech | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 309–332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where code-switching among two or more languages is very common, it may become normal for words from both languages to be used together in everyday speech. Unlike code-switching, where a switch tends to occur at [[Semantics|semantically]] or [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistically]] meaningful junctures,{{efn|See also [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)]].}} this code-mixing has no specific meaning in the local context. A fused lect is identical to a mixed language in terms of semantics and pragmatics, but fused lects allow less variation since they are fully grammaticalized. In other words, there are grammatical structures of the fused lect that determine which source-language elements may occur.&lt;ref name="Auer1999"/&gt;

A mixed language is different from a [[creole language]]. Creoles are thought to develop from pidgins as they become [[Nativization|nativized]].&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. 2002. "Pidgins and Creoles." In ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics'' (fourth ed.). Blackwell. pp. 57–86&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed languages develop from situations of code-switching. (See the distinction between code-mixing and pidgin above.)

===Local names===
There are many names for specific mixed languages or fused lects. These names are often used facetiously or carry a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;Romaine, Suzanne and Braj Kachru. 1992. "Code-mixing and code-switching." In T. McArthur (ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language''.

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as “cognitive theory”) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writer’s thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writers’ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayes’  essay, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” sought to outline the writer’s choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writers’ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyons’ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16248">'''Discourse ethics''' refers to a type of [[argument]] that attempts to establish normative or ethical truths by examining the presuppositions of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;“Discourse Ethics.” Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/discourse-ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this argument have been used in the establishment of [[egalitarian]] ethics, as well as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ethics.

==Habermas and Apel==
German philosophers [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] are considered the originators of modern discourse ethics.&lt;ref name="Àbba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Àbba|first=Giuseppe|title=Quale Impostazione per la filosofia morale?|publisher=LAS|location=Roma|year=1996|isbn=978-88-213-0314-2|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of [[communicative rationality]] in the sphere of moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian [[deontological ethics]] in terms of the analysis of communicative structures.  This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality. It is also a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts.  However, the entire project is undertaken as a [[rational reconstruction]] of moral insight.  It claims only to reconstruct the implicit normative orientations that guide individuals and it claims to access these through an analysis of communication.

===Public discourse ethics===
This type of ethics consists of conversations about ideas in civic or community contexts marked by diversity of perspectives requiring thoughtful public engagement. This discourse is made up of differing insights that helps to shape the public's engagement with one another.&lt;ref name= "Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell|title=Communication ethics Literacy|publisher= SAGE Publications Inc.|location=California|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-4214-0|pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discourse is meant to protect and to promote the public good. For public discourse ethics to be successful there must be an effective level of civility between people or persons involved. It was Sigmund Freud who once said, "civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock" and that statement is something that continues to be seen in society today.&lt;ref name= "Waisanen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waisanen|first=D|title=TOWARD ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT:THE VALUE OF DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSE FOR CIVIL COMMUNICATION|pages=287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard Law Review accurately examines public discourse and explains it in a manner that is appropriate and conceptually accurate. "Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgement of the public, and anyone may comment upon his performance.... [W]hatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgement upon them-to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them into ridicule if they be ridiculous".&lt;ref name= "Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Post|first=Robert|title=''Harvard Law Review''|year=1990|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the public discourse ethics to be productive there must be accountability on the public stage as the Harvard Law Review calls into question. Without any act of accountability the ethicality of the discourse is no longer valid and cannot go on. Public accountability consists of three basic factors. The factors are a diversity of ideas, an engagement  of public decision making, and finally an account for continuing a practice or way of doing something or a means or reason for changing the practice. Finally, public discourse ethics puts a great responsibility on the individual. They must continually be asking questions and finding answers. They will not always be right; and that is okay. As long as they are able to make a positive decision in the end.

===Presupposition===
Habermas maintains that normative validity cannot be understood as separate from the argumentative procedures used in everyday practice, such as those used to resolve issues concerning the legitimacy of actions and the validity of the norms governing interactions. He makes this claim by making reference to the validity dimensions attached to speech acts in communication and the implicit forms of argumentation they imply (see [[Universal pragmatics]]). The basic idea is that the validity of a moral norm cannot be justified in the mind of an isolated individual reflecting on the world. The validity of a norm is justified only intersubjectively in processes of argumentation between individuals; in a [[dialectic]]. The validity of a claim to normative rightness depends upon the mutual understanding achieved by individuals in argument.

From this it follows that the [[presupposition]]s of argumentation would become important. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] extracted moral principles from the necessities forced upon a rational subject reflecting on the world. Habermas extracts moral principles from the necessities forced upon individuals engaged in the discursive justification of validity claims, from the inescapable presuppositions of communication and argumentation. These presuppositions were the kinds of idealization that individuals had to make in order for communication and argumentation to even begin. For example:
* The presupposition that participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way
* The presupposition that no relevant argument is suppressed or excluded by the participants
* The presupposition that no force except that of the better argument is exerted
* The presupposition that all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument

There were also presuppositions unique to discourse:
* The presupposition that everyone would agree to the universal validity of the claim thematized
* The presupposition that everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate, and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires
* The presupposition that no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation

These are all at the center of Habermas's moral theory. Habermas's discourse ethics attempts to distill the idealized moral point of view that accompanies a perfectly rational process of argumentation (also idealized), which would be the moral principle implied by the presuppositions listed above.  The key point is that the presuppositions of argumentation and communication that have been rationally reconstructed by Habermas are both factual and normative.  This can be said about his entire project because it is explicitly attempting to bridge the gap between the "is" and the "ought."  Habermas speaks of the mutual recognition and exchanging of roles and perspectives that are demanded by the very structural condition of rational argumentation. He maintains that what is implied in these factual presuppositions of communication is the deep structure of moral norms, the conditions that every valid norm must fulfill.

===Universalization===
The presuppositions of communication express a universal obligation to maintain impartial judgment in discourse, which constrains all affected to adopt the perspectives of all others in the exchange of reasons.  From this Habermas extracts the following principle of universalization (U), which is the condition every valid norm has to fulfill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(U) All affected can accept the consequences and the side effects that [the norm's] general observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of everyone's interests, and the consequences are preferred to those of known alternative possibilities for regulation. (Habermas, 1991:65)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This can be understood as the deep structure of all acceptable moral norms, and should not be confused with the principle of discourse ethics (D), which presupposes that norms exist that satisfy the conditions specified by (U).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(D) Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implications of (U) and (D) are quite profound. (U) claims to be a rational reconstruction of the impartial moral point of view at the heart of all cognitivist moral theories. According to moral cognitivists (e.g. Kant, Rawls etc.), it is only from such a moral point of view that insight into the actual (quasi-factual) impersonal obligations of a general will can be gained, because this perspective relieves decisions from the inaccuracies of personal interests.  Of course, Habermas's reconstruction is different because it is intersubjective.  That is, Habermas (unlike [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] or [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) formulates the moral point of view as it arises out of the multiple perspectives of those affected by a norm under consideration.  The moral point of view explicated in (U) is not the property of an individual subject but the property of a community of interlocutors, the results of a complex dialogical process of role taking and perspective exchanging.  Furthermore, (U) is deduced from a rational reconstruction of the presupposition of communication, which downgrades the strong transcendentalism of Kantian ethics by establishing a foundation in inner-worldly processes of communication.

(D) on the other hand is a principle concerning the manner in which norms conforming to (U) must be justified through discourse.  Again, Habermas takes the task of moral reflection out of the isolated individual's head and gives it to intersubjective processes of communication.  What (D) proposes is that moral principles must be validated in actual discourse and that those to be affected by a norm must be able to participate in argumentation concerning its validity.  No number of thought experiments can replace a communicative exchange with others regarding moral norms that will affect them.  Moreover, this general prescription concerning the type of discourse necessary for the justification of moral norms opens the process of moral deliberation to the kind of learning that accompanies a fallibilistic orientation.  (U) and (D) are catalysts for a moral learning process, which although fallible is not relative.  The flesh and blood insights of participants in communicative exchange are refracted through the universal guidelines explicated from the deep structures of communication and argumentation.  This spawns discourses with a rational trajectory, which are grounded in the particular circumstances of those involved but aimed at a universal moral validity.

===Practical applications===

The practical applications of discourse ethics have taken a significant turn after the publication of Habermas' book [[Between Facts and Norms]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1995). Between Facts and Norms. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; where its application to democracy and the legislative process was substantially refined and expanded. Prior to this book, Habermas had left open the question of the various applications of discourse theory to almost any type of consensus oriented group&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1986). Moral Consciousness and Communicative Ethics. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from highly visible political and governmental groups, such as Parliament in Great Britain and Congressional debate in the United States, and other consensus oriented activities as found in public and private institutions such as those supported on various international websites and Wikipedia.{{third-party-inline|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph --&gt;

'''Divine language''', the '''[[language]] of the [[deity|gods]]''', or, in [[monotheism]], the '''language of [[God]]''' (or [[angels]]) is the concept of a [[mystical]] or divine [[proto-language]], which predates and supersedes human speech.

==Abrahamic traditions==
{{Further|Adamic language}}
In Judaism and Christianity, it is unclear whether the language used by God to address [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was the language of Adam, who as name-giver ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:19) used it to name all living things, or if it was a different divine language. But since God is portrayed as using speech during creation, and as addressing Adam before Gen 2:19, some authorities assumed that the language of God was different from the language of Paradise invented by Adam, while most medieval [[Jewish]] authorities maintained that the [[Hebrew language]] was the language of God, which was accepted in Western Europe from at least the 16th century and until the early 20th century. {{clarification needed|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh|Versteegh, Kees]], ''The Arabic language'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; {{better source needed|date=December 2015}}

The sacred language in Islam is [[Classical Arabic]], which is a descendant of the [[Proto-Semitic language]]. Arabic, along with Hebrew and Aramaic, is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]]. {{cn|date=December 2015}} It is considered to be sacred, as, in the Muslim view, it is the language by which Allah revealed the final revealed book, the [[Quran]], to [[Muhammad]], [[Prophet of Islam]], through the angel ''[[Jibril]]''.

==Indic traditions==
In [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], "speech" [[Vāc]], i.e. the language of liturgy, now known as [[Vedic Sanskrit]], was considered the language of the gods.

Later Hindu scholarship, in particular the [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of Vedic hermeneutics,  distinguished ''Vāc'' from ''[[Śábda]]'', a distinction comparable to the Saussurian [[langue and parole]]. The concept of [[Sphoṭa]] was introduced as a kind of transcendent aspect of ''Śábda''.

==Occultism==
In 1510, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] published Book I of his ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (translated to English in 1651 as ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). Chapter 23 of the book is entitled "Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us" - wherein he states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We might doubt whether Angels, or Demons, since they are of pure spirits, use any vocal speech, or tongue amongst themselves, or to us; but that Paul in some place saith, If I speak with the tongue of men, or angels: but what their speech or tongue is, is much doubted by many. For many think that if they use any Idiome, it is [[Hebrew]], because that was the first of all, and came from heaven, and was before the [[confusion of languages]] in Babylon, in which the Law was given by God the Father, and the Gospell was preached by Christ the Son, and so many Oracles were given to the Prophets by the Holy Ghost: and seeing all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions, this alone doth alwaies continue inviolated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in chapter 27, Agrippa mentions the Divine Language again:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But because the letters of every tongue, as we shewed in the first book, have in their number, order, and figure a Celestiall and Divine originall, I shall easily grant this calculation concerning the names of spirits to be made not only by Hebrew letters, but also by Chaldean, and Arabick, Ægyptian, Greek, Latine, and any other...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 16th century, the Elizabethan mathematician and scholar [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and the medium and alchemist [[Edward Kelley]] (both of whom were familiar with Agrippa's writings) claimed that during scrying sessions, a "Celestial Speech" was received directly from Angels. They recorded large portions of the language in their journals (published today as "The Five Books of the Mysteries" and "A True and Faithful Relation..."), along with a complete text in the language called the "Book of Loagaeth" (or "Speech From God"). Dee's language, called "Angelical" in his journals, often known today by the misnomer "[[Enochian]]", follows the basic Judeo-Christian mythology about the Divine Language. According to "A True and Faithful Relation..." Angelical was supposed to have been the language God used to create the world, and then used by Adam to speak with God and Angels and to name all things in existence. He then lost the language upon his Fall from Paradise, and constructed a form of proto-Hebrew based upon his vague memory of Angelical. This proto-Hebrew, then, was the universal human language until the time of the Confusion of Tongues at the Tower of Babel. After this, all the various human languages were developed, including an even more modified Hebrew (which we know as "Biblical Hebrew"). From the time of Adam to the time of Dee and Kelley, Angelical was hidden from humans with the single exception of the patriarch Enoch - who recorded the "Book of Loagaeth" for humanity, but the book was lost in the Deluge of Noah.

[[George William Russell]] in ''The Candle of Vision'' (1918) argued that (p.&amp;nbsp;120) "The mind of man is made in the image of Deity, and the elements of speech are related to the powers in his mind and through it to the being of the Oversoul. These true roots of language are few, alphabet and roots being identical."

In [[linguistics]], the '''donor principle''' refers primarily to the observance of the  original spelling of a [[loanword]] from the original ("donor") language. This principle applies in particular to the standardization in the receiver language of [[exonym]]s when they are used in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogeographics.org/sites/default/files/080205_D5.1_Exonyms%20guidelines%20synopsis.pdf|title= Exonyms guidelines synopsis |date= |website= |publisher= EuroGeoNames|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Peter Jordan |author2=Milan Orožen Adamič |author3=Paul Woodman |title= Exonyms and the International Standardisation of Geographical Names |url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=NVReAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22exonym%22+%22donor+principle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVfZqoTJU5&amp;sig=rdggekWiaLi1VCHjqyswhpCxhN8&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-sL0-_LPAhUoDcAKHW02Br0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exonym%22%20%22donor%20principle%22&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= 11|date= 2007|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term donor principle is sometimes also used for the particular spelling of names of specific products, brands, institutions etc. chosen by their owner, founder, designer, etc., when it clashes with the official spelling rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sagittal plane|Midsagittal]] view of the human mouth. Transducer (sensor) coils are typically placed on the tongue and lips.]]
'''Electromagnetic articulography''' (EMA) is a method of measuring the position of parts of the [[Human mouth|mouth]]. EMA uses [[electromagnetic induction|sensor coils]] placed on the tongue and other parts of the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an [[electromagnetic field]] that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.

EMA is used in [[linguistics]] and [[speech pathology]] to study [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] and in medicine to study [[oropharyngeal dysphagia]]. Unlike other methods of data collection, EMA does not expose subjects to [[ionizing radiation]] and allows for large amounts of data to be collected easily.

==Principles of operation==
The ability to observe the movements of articulators has been of great importance to the study of [[phonetics]] in order to understand the way sounds are produced.&lt;ref name="Schoenle1987"&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Paul|last=Schönle|first2=Klause|last2=Gräbe|first3=Peter|last3=Wenig|last4=Höhne|first4=Jörg|last5=Schrader|first5=Jörg|last6=Conrad|first6=Bastian|journal=Brain and Language|title=Electromagnetic Articulography: Use of Alternating Magnetic Fields for Tracking Movements of Multiple Points Inside and Outside the Vocal Tract |year=1987|volume=31|pages=26&amp;ndash;35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromagnetic articulography uses the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]] to measure the position and movement of various points in and around the mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed [[Sagittal plane|midsagittally]] in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters.&lt;ref name="ManualUCLA" /&gt; The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=Speech Motor Control: New Developments in Basic and Applied Research|first=Ben |last=Maassen|first2=Pascal |last2=van Lieshout|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=Oxford|pages=325|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RBCdG9XTxLQC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=electromagnetic+articulograph+different+frequencies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAWoVChMInevA_peWyQIVwQMaCh1zfgKE#v=onepage&amp;q=electromagnetic%20articulograph%20different%20frequencies&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2004"&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=Use of Electromagnetic Midsagittal Articulography in the Study of Swallowing|first=Catriona|last=Steele|year=2004|journal=Journal of Speech, Language &amp; Hearing Research|pages=342&amp;ndash;352|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two-dimensional articulography, transmitter coils are placed in an equilateral triangle along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck.&lt;ref name="ManualUCLA" /&gt; Because of the geometric orientation of the transmitter coils, accurate readings are able to be taken as long as the sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.&lt;ref name="Steele2004" /&gt;

Articulographs able to measure in three dimensions use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs are able to make measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.&lt;ref name="Yunusova2009" /&gt;

===Development of two and three dimensional sensors===
Thomas Hixon was the first to describe the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in ''The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Hixon1971"&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Thomas|last=Hixon|title=An Electromagnetic Method for Transducing Jaw Movements during Speech|journal=Acoustical Society of America|year=1971|volume=49|pages=603&amp;ndash;606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early EMA systems like Hixon's had problems with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data.&lt;ref name="Schoenle1987" /&gt; In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt.&lt;ref name="Schoenle1987" /&gt; However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth.&lt;ref name="ManualUCLA"&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=Articulograph AG100 Electromagnetic Articulation Analyzer Homemade Manual UCLA Phonetics Lab|last=Zhang|first=Jie|first2=Ian|last2=Maddieson|first3=Taehong|last3=Cho|first4=Marco|last4=Baroni|year=1999|place=Web|publisher=UCLA|url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/faciliti/facilities/physiology/Emamual.html|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2004" /&gt; In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that would be able to measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009.&lt;ref name="Yunusova2009"&gt;{{Cite LSA|year=2009|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|volume=52|pages=547&amp;ndash;555|title=Accuracy Assessment for AG500, Electromagnetic Articulograph|first=Yana|last=Yunusova|first2=Jordan|last2=Green|first3=Antje|last3=Mefferd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are [[dipoles]], when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.&lt;ref name="Yunusova2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zierdt1993"&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=Problems of Electromagnetic Position Transduction for a Three-Dimensional Articulographic Measurement System|journal=Institut fur Phonetik und sprachliche Kommunikation der Universitat Munchen - Forschungsberichte|volume=31|pages=137&amp;ndash;141|year=1993|first=Andreas|last=Zierdt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Trumpet_Triple_Tonguing_Visualisation.tif|right|thumb|200px|Visualisation of the tongue motions of a trumpet player]]
==Effect on subjects==
As sensor coils are placed on the tongue of the subject, articulation may be affected depending on the placement of the coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hardcastle2006"&gt;{{cite LSA| first=William| last=Hardcastle | first2=Nigel | last2=Hewlett | title=Coarticulation: Theory, Data, and Techniques | year=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Studies in Speech Science and Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has not been shown that long term exposure to electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health, but it is recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize pacemakers. Guidelines place the limit for safe continuous exposure between 100[[Tesla (unit)|μT]] and 200μT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA| first=J.H.| last=Bernhardt| year=1988| journal=Radiation and Environmental Biophysics| title=The establishment of frequency dependent limits for electric and magnetic fields and evaluation of indirect effects| volume=27| pages=1&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field and frequencies output by electromagnetic articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT.

==Alternative methods==
Various diagnostic techniques preceded electromagnetic articulography.

===Palatography and electropalatography===
{{main|Palatography|electropalatography}}
[[Palatography]] and [[electropalatography]] both measure contact of the tongue with the [[palate]] and thus are unable to measure articulations that do not make contact with the palate such as [[vowels]].&lt;ref name="Anderson2003b" /&gt;&lt;!-- needs a linguistics citation for this --&gt;

Palatography involves the painting of a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, it can be difficult to collect large amounts of data.&lt;ref name="Anderson2003b"&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Victoria|last=Anderson|first2=Patrick|last2=Barjam|first3=Robert|last3=Bowen|first4=Katya|last4=Pertsova|year=2003|title=Practical Points|series=Static Palatography|publisher=University of California Los Angeles Linguistics|place=Web|url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/faciliti/facilities/physiology/static_pal_new/practical.htm|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Victoria|last=Anderson|first2=Patrick|last2=Barjam|first3=Robert|last3=Bowen|first4=Katya|last4=Pertsova|year=2003|title=Palatograms|series=Static Palatography|publisher=University of California Los Angeles Linguistics|place=Web|url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/faciliti/facilities/physiology/static_pal_new/palatograms.htm|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electropalatography involves the use of a custom-fitted artificial palate containing electrodes that measure contact. While able to record multiple contacts, the artificial palate may obstruct or interfere with articulation, and each subject requires a custom-fitted palate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Asterios|last=Toutios|first2=Konstantinos|last2=Margaritis|chapter=On the acoustic-to-electropalatographic mapping|pages=186&amp;ndash;195|title=Nonlinear Analyses and Algorithms for Speech Processing|place=Barcelona, Spain|publisher=International Conference on Non-Linear Speech Processing|year=2005|editorfirst=Marcos|editorlast=Faundez-Zanuy|editorfirst2=Léonard|editorlast2=Janer|editorfirst3=Anna|editorlast3=Esposito|editorfirst4=Antonio|editorlast4=Satue-Villar|editorfirst5=Josep|editorlast5=Roure|editorfirst6=Virginia|editorlast6=Espinosa-Duro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video fluoroscopy===
{{Main|Fluoroscopy}}
Video fluoroscopy uses x-ray radiation to produce moving pictures of the mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of [[Oropharyngeal dysphagia|dysphagia]] because of its ability to take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events.&lt;ref name="Olthoff2014"&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Arno |last=Olthoff|first2=Shuo|last2=Zhang| first3=Renate| last3=Schweizer| first4=Jens| last4=Frahm|year=2014|title=On the Physiology of Normal Swallowing as Revealed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Real Time|journal=Gastroenterology Research and Practice|volume=2014|pages=n.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to study and treat [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/Videofluoroscopic-Swallowing-Study/|title=Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS)|year=n.d.|publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|place=Web|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Steele2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|first=Gary|last=Gramigna|year=2006|chapter=How to perform video-fluoroscopic swallowing studies|title=GI Motility online|seriestitle=GI Motility online|volume=Part 1|pages=n.p.|editorfirst=Raj| editorlast=Goyal|editorfirst2=Reza|editorlast2=Shaker|publisher=Nature|place=Web|url=http://www.nature.com/gimo/contents/pt1/full/gimo95.html|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.

===X-ray microbeam===
Similar to video fluoroscopy, X-ray microbeam studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm in size, are placed in and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow [[x-ray]] beams, about 6mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, on the pellets and track them as they move.&lt;ref name="Westbury1991"&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=The significance and measurement of head position during speech production experiments using the x-ray microbeam system|first=John |last=Westbury |year=1991|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/89/4/10.1121/1.401012|pages=1782 &amp;ndash; 1793|volume=89|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Steele2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westbury1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSA|title=X-ray Microbeam Speech Production Database User's Handbook|year=June 1994|first=John|last=Westbury|publisher=University of Wisconsin|chapter=XRMB History|pages=4&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English script''' is a [[cursive]] style, used especially for [[capital letters]], which first emerged in 18th century [[England]], and later spread across the world. This very elaborate script appeared with the spread of the metallic [[quill]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, calligraphy experienced a new-found resurgence due to its use in advertising, magazine design and commercial presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Hardy Wilson, ''The Encyclopedia of Calligraphy Techniques'', pg. 156.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30647">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''fast mapping''' is the term used for the hypothesized mental process whereby a new concept is learned (or a new hypothesis formed) based only on a single exposure to a given unit of information.  Fast mapping is thought by some researchers to be particularly important during [[language acquisition]] in young children, and may serve (at least in part) to explain the prodigious rate at which children gain vocabulary. In order to successfully use the fast mapping process, a child must possess the ability to use "referent selection" and "referent retention" of a novel word. There is evidence that this can be done by children as young as two years old, even with the constraints of minimal time and several distractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Chad Spiegel and Justin Halberda|url=http://www.psy.jhu.edu/~labforchilddevelopment/pdf_files/Spiegal%20Halberda%202011.pdf|title=Rapid fast-mapping abilities in 2-year-olds|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=132–40|year=2010|accessdate=23 January 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.10.013|pmid=21145067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research in fast mapping has also shown that children are able to retain a newly learned word for a substantial amount of time after they are subjected to the word for the first time (Carey and Bartlett, 1978). Further research by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children can remember a novel word a week after it was presented to them even with only one exposure to the novel word. While children have also displayed the ability to have equal recall for other types of information, such as novel facts, their ability to extend the information seems to be unique to novel words. This suggests that fast mapping is a specified mechanism for word learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Behrend, D.A., Scofield, J., &amp; Kleinknecht, E.E.|title=Beyond fast mapping: Young children's extensions of novel words and novel facts|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|issue=5|pages=698–705|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.698|pmid=11552764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was first formally articulated and the term 'fast mapping' coined by [[Harvard]] researchers [[Susan Carey]] and Elsa Bartlett in 1978.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Carey, S.  |author2=Bartlett, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1978|title=Acquiring a single new word|conference=Proceedings of the Stanford Child Language Conference|volume=15|pages=17–29}} (Republished in Papers and Reports on Child Language Development 15, 17–29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence against ==
Today, there is evidence to suggest that children do not learn words through 'fast mapping' but rather learn probabilistic, predictive relationships between objects and sounds that develop over time. Evidence for this comes, for example, from children's struggles to understand color words: although infants can distinguish between basic color categories,&lt;ref name="Bornstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Kessen | first2 = W. | last3 = Weiskopf | first3 = S. | year = 1976 | title = Color vision and hue categorization in young human infants | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.2.1.115| pmid = 1262792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many sighted children use color words in the same way that blind children do up until the fourth year.&lt;ref name="Gleitman"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Landau, B., &amp; Gleitman, L. R.|year=1985|title=Language and experience: Evidence from the blind child|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, words such as "blue" and "yellow" appear in their vocabularies and they produce them in appropriate places in speech, but their application of individual color terms is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked its color, typical three-year-olds seem as likely to answer "red" as "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rice, N.|year=1980|title=Cognition to language|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=University Park Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

=== Alternate theories ===
An alternate theory of deriving the meaning of newly learned words by young children during language acquisition stems from John Locke's "associative proposal theory". Compared to the "intentional proposal theory", associative proposal theory refers to the deduction of meaning by comparing the novel object to environmental stimuli.  A study conducted by Yu &amp; Ballard (2007), introduced cross-situational learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chen, Yu|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~dll/papers/yu_psychscience07.pdf|title=Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics|journal=Psychological Science|volume=18|issue=5|year=2006|accessdate=18 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x|pmid=17576281|pages=414–420|citeseerx=10.1.1.385.7473}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method based on Locke's theory. Cross-situtational learning theory is a mechanism in which the child learns meaning of words over multiple exposures in varying contexts in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty of the word's true meaning on an exposure-by-exposure basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank, Michael|url=http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/F-chapterunderreview.pdf|title=Learning words through probabilistic inferences about speakers' communicative intentions|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, more recent studies&lt;ref name="Medina"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Medina, T. N., Snedeker, J., Trueswell, J. C., and Gleitman, L. R.|year=2010|title=How words can and cannot be learned by observation|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105040108|pmid=21576483|pmc=3107260|pages=9014–9019|volume=108|issue=22|journal=PNAS|url=http://www.ircs.upenn.edu/~truesweb/lila_pdfs/Medina%20Snedeker%20Trueswell%20&amp;%20Gleitman%202011%20-%20word-learning%20by%20observation.pdf|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.9014M}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that some amount of fast mapping does take place, questioning the validity of previous laboratory studies that aim to show that probabilistic learning does occur.  A critique to the theory of fast mapping is how can children connect the meaning of the novel word with the novel word after just one exposure? For example, when showing a child a blue ball and saying the word "blue" how does the child know that the word blue explains the color of the ball, not the size, or shape? If children learn words by fast mapping than they must use inductive reasoning to understand the meaning associated with the novel word. A popular theory to explain this inductive reasoning is that children apply [[Word learning biases|word-learning constraints]] to the situation where a novel word is introduced. There are speculations as to why this is; Markman and Wachtel (1988) conducted a study that helps explain the possible underlying principles of fast mapping. They claim children adhere to the theories of [[Word learning biases#cite note-Hansen-3|whole-object bias]], the assumption that a novel label refers to the entire object rather than its parts, color, substance or other properties, and mutual exclusivity bias, the assumption that only one label applies to each object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M.B. | last2 = Markman | first2 = E.M. | year = 2009 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 592–596 | doi=10.1037/a0014838| pmid = 19271842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, children were presented with an object that they either were familiar with or was presented with a whole object term. Markman and Watchel concluded that the mere juxtaposition between familiar and novel terms may assist in part term acquisition. In other words, children will put constraints on themselves and assume the novel term refers to the whole object in view rather than to its parts.&lt;ref name=Almgren&gt;{{cite book|authors=Braisby, Nick; Dockrell, Julie E. and Best, Rachel M.|year=2001|chapter=Children's acquisition of science terms: does fast mapping work?|editors=Almgren, Margareta; Barreña, Adoni; Ezeizabarrena, María-José; Idiazabal, Itziar and MacWhinney, Brian |title=Research on child language acquisition: proceedings of the 8th Conference of the International Association for the Study of Child Language|location=Somerville, MA, USA|publisher=Cascadilla Press|pp=1066–1087|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/3641/1/IASCL_Paper_II.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been six lexical constraints proposed (reference, extendibility, object scope, categorical scope, novel name, conventionality) that guide a child's learning of a novel word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt; When learning a new word children apply these constraints. However, this purposed method of constraints is not flawless. If children use these constraints there are many words that children will never learn such as actions, attributes, and parts. Studies have found that both toddlers and adults were more likely to categorize an object by its shape than its size or color.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

==Cross-situational learning versus propose but verify==
The next question in fast mapping theory is how exactly is the meaning of the novel word learned? An experiment performed in October 2012 by the Department of Psychology by University of Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=Trueswell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trueswell|first1=John C.|last2=Medina|first2=Tamara Nicol|last3=Hafri|first3=Alon|last4=Gleitman|first4=Lila R.|title=Propose but verify: Fast mapping meets cross-situational word learning|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=126–156|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.10.001|pmid=23142693|pmc=3529979|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers attempted to determine if fast mapping occurs via cross-situational learning or by another method, "Propose but verify". In cross-situational learning, listeners hear a novel word and store multiple conjectures of what the word could mean based on its situational context. Then after multiple exposures the listener is able to target the meaning of the word by ruling out conjectures. In propose but verify, the learner makes a single conjecture about the meaning of the word after hearing the word used in context. The learner then carries that conjecture forward to be reevaluated and modified for consistency when the word is used again. The results of the experiment seems to support that propose but verify is the way by which learners fast map new words.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
There is also controversy over whether words learned by fast mapping are retained or forgotten. Previous research has found that generally, children retain a newly learned word for a period of time after learning. In the aforementioned Carey and Bartlett study (1978), children who were taught the word "chromium" were found to keep the new lexical entry in working memory for several days, illustrating a process of gradual lexical alignment known as "extended mapping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swingley|first1=Daniel|title=Fast Mapping and Slow Mapping in Children's Word Learning|journal=Language Learning and Development|date=30 June 2010|volume=6|issue=3|pages=179–183|doi=10.1080/15475441.2010.484412|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~swingley/papers/swingley_LLD10_fastmap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study, performed by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children remembered words up to 1 month after the study was conducted. However, more recent studies have shown that words learned by fast mapping tend to be forgotten over time. In a study conducted by Vlach and Sandhofer (2012), memory supports, which had been included in previous studies, were removed. This removal appeared to result in a low retention of words over time. This is a possible explanation for why previous studies showed high retention of words learned by fast mapping.&lt;ref name=Vlach/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Some researchers are concerned that experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in artificial settings. They feel that fast mapping doesn't occur as often in more real life, natural situations. They believe that testing for fast mapping should focus more on the actual understanding of a word instead of just its reproduction. For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt;

== Variables affecting an individual's fast mapping ability==

=== Bilingualism ===

When learning novel words, it is believed that early exposure to multiple linguistic systems facilitates the acquisition of new words later in life. This effect was referred to by Kaushanskaya and Marian (2009) as the bilingual advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaushanskaya|first1=M|last2=Marian|first2=V|title=The Bilingual Advantage in Novel Word Learning|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=705–710|doi=10.3758/pbr.16.4.705|pmid=19648456|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, a bilingual individual's ability to fast map can vary greatly throughout their life.

During the language acquisition process, a child may require a greater amount of time to determine a correct referent than a child who is a monolingual speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alt|first=Mary|author2=Christina Meyers |author3=Cecilia Figueroa |title=Factors That Influence Fast Mapping in Children Exposed to Spanish and English|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|year=2013|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1237–38|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0092)|pmid=23816663|pmc=4487618}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time a bilingual child is of school age, they perform equally on naming tasks when compared to monolingual children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=Li|last2=McGregor|first2=Karla|last3=Marian|first3=Viorica|title=Lexical-Semantic Organization in Bilingual Children: Evidence from a Repeated Word Association Task|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2006|volume=49|issue=3|pages=572–587|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/041)|pmc=1894819|pmid=16787896}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of adulthood, bilingual individuals have acquired word-learning strategies believed to be of assistance on fast mapping tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marian|first1=V|last2=Faroqi-Shah|first2=Y|last3=Kaushanskaya|first3=M|last4=Blumenfeld|first4=H|last5=Sheng|first5=L|title=Bilingualism: Consequences for Language, Cognition, Development, and the Brain|journal=ASHA Leader|date=2009|volume=14|issue=13|pages=10–13|doi=10.1044/leader.FTR2.14132009.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is speech practice, a strategy where the participant listens and reproduces the word in order to assist in remembering and decrease the likelihood of forgetting .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Bilingualism can increase an individual's cognitive abilities and contribute to their success in fast mapping words, even when they are using a nonnative language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong Kan|first1=Pui|last2=Sadagopan|first2=Neeraja|last3=Janich|first3=Lauren|last4=Andrade|first4=Marixa|title=Effects of Speech Practice on Fast Mapping in Monolingual and Bilingual Speakers|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2014|volume=57|issue=3|pages=929–941|doi=10.1044/2013_jslhr-l-13-0045|pmid=24167242}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic status ===

Children growing up in a low-socioeconomic status environment receive less attention than those in high-socioeconomic status environments. As a result, these children may be exposed to less words and therefore their language development may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirk | first1 = E. | last2 = Howlett | first2 = N. | last3 = Pine | first3 = K.

However, when examining their fast mapping abilities there were no significant differences observed in their ability to learn and remember novel words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horton-Ikard|first1=R|last2=Weismer|first2=S|title=A Preliminary Examination of Vocabulary and Word Learning in African American Toddlers from Middle and Low Socioeconimc Status Homes|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=381–392|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2007/041)|pmid=17971497|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children from low SES families were able to use multiple sources of information in order to fast map novel words. When working with children from low SES homes, providing a context of the word that attributes meaning, is a linguistic strategy that can benefit the child's word knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=E.J|last2=Schuele|first2=C|title=An Examination of Fast Mapping Skills in Preschool Children from Families with Low Socioeconomic Status|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=26|issue=10|pages=845–862|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.705215|year=2012|pmid=22954365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face-to-face interaction ===
Three learning supports that have been proven to help with the fast mapping of words are saliency, repetition and generation of information.&lt;ref name=Vlach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley|last2=Sandhofer|first2=Catherine|title=Fast mapping across time: memory processes support children's retention of learned words|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=February 2012|volume=3|pages=1–8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00046|pmc=3286766|pmid=22375132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of [[face-to-face interaction]] a child has with their parent affects his or her ability to fast map novel words. Interaction with a parent leads to greater exposure to words in different contexts, which in turn promotes language acquisition. Face to face interaction cannot be replaced by educational shows because although repetition is used, children do not receive the same level of correction or trial and error from simply watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = DA | last2 = Gilkerson | first2 = J | last3 = Richards | first3 = JA | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Audible Television and Decreased Adult Words, Infant Vocalizations, and Conversational Turns: A Population-Based Study | url = | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 163 | issue = 6| pages = 554–558 | doi = 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.61 | pmid = 19487612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child is asked to generate the word it promotes the transition to long-term memory to a larger extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertsch|first1=Sharon|last2=Pesta|first2=B.J|last3=Wiscott|first3=R|last4=McDaniel|first4=M|title=The generation effect: A meta-analytic review|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=2007|volume=35|issue=2|doi=10.3758/bf03193441|pages=201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence of fast mapping in other animals ==
It appears that fast mapping is not only limited to humans, but can occur in dogs as well. In an experiment, a dog, named Rico, was able to learn the labels of over 200 various items. He was also able to identify novel objects simply by exclusion learning. Exclusion learning occurs when one learns the name of a novel object because one is already familiar with the names of other objects belonging to the same group. The researchers, who conducted the experiment, mention the possibility that a language acquisition device specific to humans does not control fast mapping.  They believe that fast mapping is possibly directed by simple memory mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaminski | first1 = J | last2 = Call | first2 = J | last3 = Fischer | first3 = J | year = 2004 | title = Word Learning in a Domestic Dog: Evidence for "Fast Mapping | url = | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5677| pages = 1682–1683 | doi=10.1126/science.1097859 | pmid=15192233| bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1682K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the deaf population ==
A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the children were a maximum of 5 years old. The conclusion that was drawn from the study is that the ability to fast map has a relationship to the size of the lexicon. The children with normal hearing had a larger lexicon and therefore were able to more accurately fast map compared to deaf and hard of hearing children who did not have as large of a lexicon. It is by around age 5 that deaf and hard of hearing children have a similar size lexicon to 5 year old children of normal hearing. This evidence supports the idea that fast mapping requires inductive reasoning so the larger the lexicon (number of known words) the easier it is for the child to reason out the accurate meaning for the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Diane Clark|author2=Marc Marschark|author3=Michael A. Karchmer|year=2001|title=Context, Cognition, and Deafness|pages=103–107|publisher=Gallaudet University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of cochlear implants (CIs), there are variegated opinions on whether cochlear implants impact a child's ability to become a more successful fast mapper.  In 2000, a study by Kirk, Myomoto, and others determined that there was a general correlation between the age of Cochlear Implant implementation and improved lexical skills (e.g. fast mapping and other vocabulary growth skills). They believed that children given implants prior to two years of age yielded higher success rates than older children between five and seven years of age.  With that said, researchers at the University of Iowa wish to amend that very generalization.  In 2013, "Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants" by Elizabeth Walker and others indicated that although there may be a some levels of increased vocabulary acquisition in CI individuals, many post-implantees generally were slower developers of his/her own lexicon.  Walker bases her claims on another research study in 2007 (Tomblin et al.)  One of the purposes of this study was to note a CI child's ability to comprehend and retain novel words with related referents.  When compared with non-deaf children, the CI children had lower success scores in retention.  This finding was based on scorings obtained from their test: from 0 to 6 (0 the worst, 6 the best), CI children averaged a score around a 2.0 whereas non-deaf children scored higher (roughly 3.86).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walker, Elizabeth|author2=McGregor, Karla|author3=Bacon, Sid|author4=Tobey, Emily|title=Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, &amp; Hearing Research|volume=56|issue=2|pages=375–87|year=2013|pmid=22896047|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0343)|pmc=3578980 |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with ADHD==
An experiment was performed to assess fast mapping in adults with typical language abilities, disorders of spoken/written language (hDSWL), and adults with hDSWL and ADHD. 
The conclusion draw from the experiment revealed that adults with ADHD were the least accurate at "mapping semantic features and slower to respond to lexical labels." 
The article reasoned that the tasks of fast mapping requires high attentional demand and so "a lapse in attention could lead to diminished encoding of the new information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mary|first=Alt|author2=Michelle L. Gutmann|title=Fast mapping semantic features: Performance of adults with normal language, history of disorders of spoken and written language, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder on a word learning task|journal=J Communication Disorders|volume=42|issue=5|date=April 5, 2009|pages=347–364|pmid=19439319|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2009.03.004|pmc=2771630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with language deficits==

Fast mapping in individuals with [[aphasia]] has gained research attention due to its effect on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Research done by Blumstein makes an important distinction between those with [[Broca's aphasia]], who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with [[Wernicke's aphasia]], who cannot link words with meaning. In Broca's aphasia, Blumstein found that whereas individuals with Wernicke's aphasia performed at the same level as the normal control group, those with Broca's aphasia showed slower reaction times for word presentations after reduced voice onset time stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blumstein, S. E.|author2=Milberg, W.|author3=Brown, T.|author4=Hutchinson, A.|author5=Kurowski, K.|author6=Burton, M. W.|year=2000|lastauthoramp=y|title=The mapping from sound structure to the lexicon in aphasia: Evidence from rhyme and repetition priming|journal=Brain and Language|volume=72|issue=2|pages=75–99|pmid=10722782|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca's aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation. Bloomstein's findings reinforce the crucial difference between one's ability to retain novel stimuli versus the ability to express novel stimuli. Because individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are only limited in their understanding of semantic meaning, it makes sense that the participant's novel stimulus recall would not be affected. On the other hand, those with Broca's aphasia lack the ability to produce speech, in effect hindering their ability to recall novel stimuli. Although individuals with Broca's aphasia are limited in their speech production, it is not clear whether they simply cannot formulate the physical speech or if they actually did not process the stimuli.

Research has also been done investigating fast mapping abilities in children with language deficits.  One study done by Dollaghan compared children with normal language to those with expressive syntactic deficits, a type of specific language impairment characterized by simplified speech.  The study found that normal and language impaired children did not differ in their ability to connect the novel word to referent or to comprehend the novel word after a single exposure.  The only difference was that the language-impaired children were less successful in their production of the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dollaghan, C. |year=1987|title=Fast Mapping in Normal and Language-Impaired Children|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders|volume=52|issue=3|pages=218–222|pmid=3455444|doi=10.1044/jshd.5203.218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that expressive language deficits are unrelated to the ability to connect word and referent in a single exposure.  The problem for children with those deficits arises only when trying to convert that mental representation into verbal speech.

==In individuals with intellectual disabilities==
A few researchers looked at fast mapping abilities in boys with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also referred to as [[autism spectrum]], and boys with [[fragile X syndrome]] (FXS). The experimental procedure consisted of a presentation phase where two objects were presented, one of which was a novel object with a nonsense word name. This was followed by a comprehension testing phase, which assessed the boys' ability to remember and correctly select the novel objects. Even though all groups in the study had fast mapping performances above chance levels, in comparison to boys showing typical development, those with ASD and FXS demonstrated much more difficulty in comprehending and remembering names assigned to the novel objects. The authors concluded that initial processes involved in associative learning, such as fast mapping, are hindered in boys with FXS and ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDuffie | first1 = A. | last2 = Kover | first2 = S.

==Computational models==
Research in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] to reproduce computationally this ability, termed [[one-shot learning]]. This is pursued to reduce the learning curve, as other models like [[reinforcement learning]] need thousand of exposures to a situation to learn it.

'''Feature geometry''' is a [[Phonology|phonological]] theory which represents [[distinctive features]] as a structured hierarchy rather than a matrix or a set. Feature geometry grew out of [[autosegmental phonology]], which emphasizes the autonomous nature of distinctive features and the non-uniform relationships among them. Feature geometry recognizes that some sets of features often pattern together in phonological and phonotactic generalizations, while others rarely interact. Feature geometry thus formally encodes groups of features under nodes in a tree: features that commonly pattern together are said to share a parent node, and operations on this set can be encoded as operation on the parent node.

One node in feature geometries is the Laryngeal node. The Laryngeal node is an organizing node that dominates the features of the [[Distinctive feature#Laryngeal features|larynx]], usually taken to be [voice], [constricted glottis], and [spread glottis]. It is common for these three features to pattern together in the phonology of the world's languages to the exclusion of every other feature, and in feature geometry, this follows from the tree representation. Similarly, feature geometries generally include a Place node that is the dominant node of the [[Distinctive feature#Place features|place features]], which also often pattern together. Feature geometry is easily compatible with theories of [[underspecification]] and can represent incomplete segments by missing nodes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Root node is the topmost node of the feature tree and works as the formal organizing unit of the segment, and in some frameworks encodes the major class features such as [consonantal], [sonorant], and [approximant]. Some features such as [nasal] and [lateral] are sometimes dependent of the root node, or sometimes of a Supralaryngeal node along with Place. Other features such as [anterior] and [distributed] are usually dependent from the Coronal place feature.

The first formal model of feature geometry was introduced in print by [[Nick Clements|George N. Clements]] in 1985, drawing on unpublished work by K.P. Mohanon and Joan Mascaró. Another precursor to feature geometry was proposed by Roger Lass in 1976, in which he proposed a laryngeal feature submatrix within a distinctive feature matrix. Other important models have been proposed by Elizabeth Sagey (1986), John J. McCarthy (1988), and Clements &amp; Hume (1995). Models vary widely in the number of the hierarchical nodes and in how consonant and vowel features are treated.

Feature geometry has attracted formal and conceptual criticism. In 2003 [[Charles Reiss]] argued that feature geometry is insufficiently powerful to account for a class of phonological rules that involve dependencies between segments, such as partial and total identity and nonidentity. Feature geometry is unable to encode these properties. In 2008 [[Jeff Mielke]] argued that feature geometry merely recapitulated physiological organization, and that since the influence of articulation on [[sound changes|sound change]] will independently create patterns in the behavior of features, feature geometry recapitulates diachrony and is redundant as a theory of the mental organisation of phonology.

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''Gibberish''', alternatively '''jibberish''', '''jibber-jabber''', or '''gobbledygook''', is language that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include [[phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]] that are not actual [[word]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=J.P.S. |last2=Shamsie |first2=S.J. |year=1959 |title=A systematic examination of gibberish in a multilingual schizophrenic patient |url=http://las.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/1 |journal=Language and Speech |publisher=Sage |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1177/002383095900200102 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[language game]]s and specialized [[jargon]] that seems nonsensical to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laycock |first=D. |year=1972 |title=Towards a typology of ludlings, or play-languages |journal=Linguistic Communications: Working Papers of the Linguistic Society of Australia |volume=6 |pages=61–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibberish should not be confused with [[literary nonsense]] such as that used in the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" by [[Lewis Carroll]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The word ''gibberish'' is more commonly applied to informal speech, while ''gobbledygook'' (sometimes ''gobbledegook'', ''gobbledigook'' or ''gobbledegoo'') is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  "[[Officialese]]", "[[legalese]]", or "bureaucratese" are forms of gobbledygook. The related word ''jibber-jabber'' refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Angus|last2=Lindberg|first2=Christine A.|title=jibber-jabber |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=978-0-19-539288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''gibberish'' was first seen in English in the early 16th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chantrell |first=Glynnis |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |location=Oxford, UK |pages=231 |isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[etymology]] is not certain, but it is generally thought to be an [[onomatopoeia]] imitative of speech, similar to the words ''jabber'' (to talk rapidly) and ''gibber'' (to speak inarticulately).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2013 |title=gibberish |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gibberish |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may originate from the word ''jib'', which is the [[Angloromani]] variant of the [[Romani language]] word meaning "language" or "tongue". To non-speakers, the Anglo-Romany dialect could sound like English mixed with nonsense words, and if those seemingly-nonsensical words are referred to as "jib" then the term "gibberish" (pronounced "jibberish") could be derived as a descriptor for nonsensical speech. Another theory is that gibberish came from the name of a famous 8th&amp;nbsp;century [[arab|Arabian]] alchemist, [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], whose name was [[List of Latinised names|Latinized]] as "Geber."

==History==
The term "gobbledygook" has a long history of usage in politics.  Nixon's [[Watergate tapes|Oval Office tape]] from June 14, 1971, showed [[H. R. Haldeman]] describing a situation to Nixon as "... a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: You can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheen |first=Francis |title=Strange Days Indeed: The Golden Age of Paranoia |year=2010 |publisher=Public Affairs |isbn=978-0-00-744120-4 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Ronald Reagan]] explained tax law revisions in an address to the nation with the word, May 28, 1985, saying that "most didn’t improve the system; they made it more like Washington itself: Complicated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and loopholes designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/38/338.html |title=Simpson’s contemporary quotations |publisher=Bartleby.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207025031/http://www.bartleby.com/63/38/338.html |archive-date=December 7, 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, US Supreme Court justice [[John Roberts]] dismissed quantitative sociological reasoning as "gobbledygook" in arguing against any numerical test for [[gerrymandering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/ |title=The Supreme Court is allergic to math |first=Oliver |last=Roeder |date=October 17, 2017 |work=[[FiveThirtyEight]] |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shanks (public official)|Michael Shanks]], former chairman to the National Consumer Council of [[Great Britain]], characterizes professional gobbledygook as sloppy jargon intended to confuse nonspecialists: "'Gobbledygook' may indicate a failure to think clearly, a contempt for one's clients, or more probably a mixture of both. A system that can't or won't communicate is not a safe basis for a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chat11.com/Contemporary_Quotes |title=Contemporary Quotes |date=October 2007 |website=Chat11.com |accessdate=4 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grass Mud Horse''' or '''Cǎonímǎ''' ({{lang|zh-Hans|草泥马}}) is a [[Internet memes in China|Chinese Internet meme]] widely used as a form of symbolic defiance of the widespread [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship in China]]. It is a [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese|play on]] the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] words ''[[Mandarin Chinese profanity#Mother|cào nǐ mā]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|肏你妈}}), literally, "fuck your mother", and is one of the so-called [[Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures|10 mythical creatures]] created in a hoax article on [[Baidu Baike]] in early 2009 whose names form obscene puns.  It has become an Internet chat forum cult phenomenon in China and has garnered worldwide press attention, with videos, cartoons and merchandise of the animal (which is said to resemble the [[alpaca]]), having appeared.

==Etymology and species==
[[File:Caonima word-150x150.jpg|thumb|150px|Chinese character invented by Netizens to depict the "Grass Mud Horse"]]
The ''Caonima'', literally "Grass Mud Horse", is supposedly a species of [[alpaca]]. The name is similar to a profanity ({{zh|c={{linktext|肏|你|妈}}/{{linktext|操|你|媽}}|p={{linktext|cào| nǐ| mā}}}}), which translates as "[[Mandarin Chinese profanity#Mother|fuck your mother]]". The comparison with the "animal" name is not an actual [[homophone]]: the two terms have the same consonants and vowels with different [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and are represented by different [[Chinese characters|characters]].&lt;ref&gt;''China Digital Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the original, anonymous article from Baidu Baike, Grass Mud Horses originate from an area known as the "Mahler Gobi" Desert ({{lang|zh|马勒戈壁}}, ''Mǎlè Gēbì'', which resembles the Chinese characters {{lang|zh|妈了个屄}}, ''māle ge bī'', meaning "your mother's fucking cunt"). Some variants of the animal are known as "Fertile Grass Mud Horses" ({{lang|zh|沃草泥马}}, ''Wò Cǎonímǎ'', which resembles {{lang|zh|我肏你妈}}, ''Wǒ cào nǐ mā'', meaning "I fuck your mother"). The Grass Mud Horse can only eat fertile grass ({{lang|zh|沃草}}, ''wò cǎo'', which resembles {{lang|zh|我肏}}, ''Wǒ cào'', meaning "I fuck!" or simply "Fuck!"). Other subspecies are known as "Crazy/Violent/Insane Grass Mud Horses" ({{lang|zh|狂草泥马}}, ''Kuáng Cǎonímǎ''), which are considered the "kings" of the Caonima. The initial image found in the original Baidu Baike article was a zebra, but was replaced with an alpaca in subsequent revisions.&lt;ref&gt;''Baidu Baike''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|right|240px|This is a Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, made by Chinese [[netizen]]s as a satire of Chinese Internet Censorship.]]

Because the Grass Mud Horse is said to be the dominant species which lives within the Mahler [[Gobi Desert]], the region is also called the "Grass Mud Horse Gobi" ({{lang|zh-cn|草泥马戈壁}}, ''Cǎonímǎ Gēbì'', which is close in pronunciation to {{lang|zh-cn|肏你妈个屄}}, ''cào nǐ mā ge bī'', meaning "fuck your mother's cunt"). The animal is characterised as "lively, intelligent and tenacious".&lt;ref&gt;Wen Yunchao&lt;/ref&gt; However, their existence is said to be threatened by "[[River crab (Internet slang)|river crabs]]" which are invading their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;''AsiaNews.it''&lt;/ref&gt;

The river crab ({{lang|zh-cn|河蟹}}, ''héxiè'') symbolises internet censorship in China. Its pronunciation resembles the word for "harmony" ({{lang|zh-cn|和谐}}, ''héxié''), in reference to the "[[harmonious society]]", to which the Chinese leadership professes to aspire, and which Chinese internet censors use to justify internet censorship.&lt;ref name=pun&gt;Wines. 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-the-internets-undercover-code|title=The internet's new secret social codes|author=Tom Chatfield|date=2013-07-01|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en|website=BBC|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004190821/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-the-internets-undercover-code|archive-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when a post on [[microblog]] is deleted, the censorship notice says that the post has been "harmonized" ({{lang|zh-cn|和谐}}, ''héxié''), which is pronounced similar to "river crab" ({{lang|zh-cn|河蟹}}, ''héxiè'') in [[Mandarin Chinese]], so the netizens say that the post has been eaten by the "river crab".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html|title=A Dirty Pun Tweaks China’s Online Censors|language=en|website=The New York Times|date=2009-03-11|access-date=2018-10-04|dead-url=no|author=Michael Wines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004190906/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html|archive-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "crab" itself is rural slang, meaning "a bully who uses power through force", and the "river crab" has become a symbol of crude censorship backed with the threat of force.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The river crab is often depicted wearing three wristwatches, since 帶3個錶 (''dài sān ge biǎo'', "wears three watches") sounds similar to {{lang|zh-cn|三个代表}} (''Sāngè Dàibiǎo''), the ideology of the "[[Three Represents]]", an interpretation of communism promoted by former Chinese leader [[Jiang Zemin]].&lt;ref&gt;''University of Pompeau Fabria, Barcelona''. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Grass Mud Horse music video's musical arrangement of a children's choir has been compared to ''[[It's a Small World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nguyen&lt;/ref&gt; and it scored 1.4&amp;nbsp;million hits in its first three months. A cartoon about the Grass Mud Horse attracted a quarter million views, and a nature documentary on its habits received 180,000 more hits in the same amount of time.&lt;ref name=pun/&gt; Even though some Grass Mud Horse videos were not technically blocked by Chinese censors, some had their sound blocked, with a message saying "This video contains an audio track that has not been authorized by [[Warner Music Group|WMG]]."&lt;ref&gt;Xiaohe1120xu&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Naked ai weiwei.jpg|thumb|left|"草泥马挡中央": [[Ai Weiwei]]'s self-portrait holding the stuffed animal has a double meaning. It can be interpreted as: "Fuck your mother, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]]"&lt;ref&gt;Estes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au"/&gt;]] --&gt;
''[[Yazhou Zhoukan]]'' ({{lang|zh|亞洲周刊}}) reported that [[Zhan Bin]], a teacher at the [[Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology]],&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker&lt;/ref&gt; created a new [[Chinese character]] by fusing the three Chinese character [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] for "grass", "mud", and "horse". The word has no official pronunciation. Official "cleanup" of the internet, which threatens the Caonima, has led Chinese internet users to create other "Mud Horse" variants, such as the {{lang|zh|"滾泥马"}} (''Gǔnnímǎ'', "Rolling Mud Horse") and the {{lang|zh|"幹泥马"}} (''Gànnímǎ'', "Working Mud Horse"). "Gunnima" and "Gannima" are puns for "fuck off" and "fuck your mother" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Li&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Grass Mud Horse" became widely known on the English-language web following the publication of a ''New York Times'' article on the phenomenon on 11 March 2009,&lt;ref name=pun/&gt; which sparked widespread discussion on blogs. In March 2011, "Grass Mud Horse" themed merchandise, such as plush dolls, began being sold over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Daddytypes.com''&lt;/ref&gt; One Guangzhou toy manufacturer reportedly produced its first batch of 150 Grass Mud Horse cuddly toys with official birth certificates issued by Mahler Gebi Mystical Creatures Bureau. The animals come in brown and white, named "Male" ({{lang|zh|马勒}}) and "Gebi" ({{lang|zh|歌碧}}) respectively, and sell for 40 yuan each. To accompany these, a user's and feeding manual have been created.&lt;ref&gt;''Nandu Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas they were called 'Caonima' before the crackdown, Internet sellers now list them using the correct Chinese term, '{{lang|zh|羊驼}}' (Alpaca).

In 2009, renowned artist [[Ai Weiwei]] published an image of himself nude with only a 'Caonima' hiding his genitals, with a caption "草泥马挡中央" ("cǎonímǎ dǎng zhōngyāng", literally "a Grass Mud Horse covering the center". One interpretation of the caption is: "fuck your mother, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]]". Political observers speculated that the photo may have contributed to Ai's arrest in 2011 by angering Communist Party hardliners.

== Grass Mud Horse Day ==

In 2012, Chinese netizens started to designate the date 1 July as the "Grass Mud Horse Day". The date coincides with the "Party Day" in China which is to celebrate the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/sy1-07022012091402.html |script-title=zh:中共七一建党节 网民反讽战当局|publisher=RFA|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political discourse ==
The [[China Digital Times]] sees Caonima as the "de facto mascot of netizens in China fighting for free expression, inspiring poetry, photos and videos, artwork, lines of clothing, and more." It is an illustration of the "resistance discourse" of Chinese internet users with "increasingly dynamic and sometimes surprising presence of an alternative political discourse: images, frames, metaphors and narratives that have been generated from Internet memes [that] undermine the values and ideology that reproduce compliance with the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian regime, and, as such, force an opening for free expression and civil society in China."

Caonima is an expression of a broader Chinese internet culture of spoofing, mockery, punning, and parody known as [[e'gao]], which includes video mash-ups and other types of bricolage.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, “Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
The [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire]] led to Chinese internet users creating a number of [[Photoshopping|photoshopped]] parodies, including one with a Caonima's outline in the smoke.

On 20 March 2009, ''[[the New York Times]]'' reported that a Chinese contributor to [[Global Voices Online]] posted a message from an Internet administrator to managers of online bulletin boards warning that "any content related with Grass-Mud Horse should not be promoted and hyped" because "the issue has been elevated to a political level ... The overseas media has exaggerated the incident as a confrontation between netizens and the government."&lt;ref&gt;Wines. 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Global Voices''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference on 25 March, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that China's access to YouTube had been officially blocked since two days earlier. According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], the block was an attempt to stem videos showing Chinese repression of the Tibetan population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Tibetan uprising of 10 March 1959]], and to block access to the popular Grass Mud Horse video posted in early March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/china-government-blocks-access-to-25-03-2009,30667.html Government blocks access to YouTube], Reporters Without Borders, 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] issued a directive on 30 March 2009 to highlight 31 categories of content prohibited online, including violence, pornography, and content which may "incite ethnic discrimination or undermine social stability". Many netizens believe the instruction follows the official embarrassment over the rise of the "Grass Mud Horse" phenomenon. Industry observers believe that the move was designed to stop the spread of parodies or other comments on politically sensitive issues in the runup to the 20th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|4 June Tiananmen Square protests]].&lt;ref name=parody&gt;{{cite news|author=Vivian Wu|title=Censors strike at internet content after parody hit |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the government's directive, most Chinese essays and blog postings made about the Grass Mud Horse have been removed from the Internet after being discovered by government censors.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt;  Some of these citizen efforts to keep the Grass Mud Horse alive have moved offshore to the U.S. and elsewhere, including for example the creation of an independent Canadian publishing house (see [[Mudgrass Press]]) referencing the meme.

The Caonima reappeared as a subject of online cartoon satire following the announcement of the [[Green Dam Youth Escort]] pornography blocking software project.&lt;ref name="zdnet090618"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=4988 |title=China's not backing down but Green Dam Girl fights back |first=Richard |last=Koman |date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Berko Gleason''' (born 1931) is a [[professor emerita]] in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (formerly the Department of Psychology) at [[Boston University]],{{refn|{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/psych/faculty/gleason/|title=Jean Berko Gleason, PhD Professor Emerita|accessdate=28 January 2013}}
}}
a [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] who has made fundamental contributions to the understanding of [[language acquisition]] in children, [[aphasia]], gender differences in language development, and parent–child interactions.{{r|beginning}}

Of her '''Wug Test''', by which she demonstrated that even young children possess implicit knowledge of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]], it has been said, "Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research", the "wug" (one of the imaginary creatures Gleason drew in creating the Wug Test) being "so basic to what [psycholinguists] know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins."{{r|beginning}}

==Biography==

[[File:GleasonAndrewMattei WithJean1958.jpg|upright=1.2|right|thumb|With [[Andrew M. Gleason|Andrew Gleason]], 1958]]

Jean Berko was born to Hungarian immigrant parents in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{refn| name=Bonvillain|{{cite book|last=Bonvillain|first=N.|title=Language, culture, and communication: the meaning of messages.|date=1993|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780135226407}} }} After graduating from [[Cleveland Heights High School]] in 1949, Gleason earned a B.A. in history and literature from [[Radcliffe College]], then an M.A. in [[linguistics]], and a combined Ph.D. in linguistics and [[psychology]], at [[Harvard]];
from 1958 to 1959 she was a postdoctoral fellow at [[MIT]].{{refn| name=cv |{{citation |url=http://www.jeanberkogleason.com/documents/jeanberkogleasoncvweb.pdf |title=Jean Berko Gleason – Curriculum Vitae}} }} In graduate school she was advised by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]], a founder in the field of [[language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. In January 1959 she married Harvard mathematician [[Andrew Gleason]]; they had three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bolker |first=Ethan D. |title=Andrew M.

Most of Gleason's professional career has been at [[Boston University]], where she served as Psychology Department chair and director of the Graduate Program in Applied Linguistics; [[Lise Menn]] and [[Harold Goodglass]] were among her collaborators there.

She has been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], and at the Linguistics Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].{{r|ceiling}}  Although officially retired and no longer teaching, she {{as of|2006|alt=continues}} to be involved in research.&lt;ref name=Skarabela&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skarabela|first1=Barbora|title=An interview with Jean Berko Gleason|journal=IASCL – Child Language Bulletin|date=July 2006|volume=26|issue=1|url=http://www.iascl.org/bulletins/bulletinV26N1.html|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason is the author or coauthor of some 125 papers on language development in children, language attrition, aphasia, and gender and cultural aspects of language acquisition and use;{{refn|{{cite web |url=http://jeanberkogleason.com/?page_id=19 |title=Jean Berko Gleason – Biographical Summary}} }}
and is editor/{{zwsp}}coeditor of two widely used textbooks, ''The Development of Language'' (first edition 1985, eighth edition 2012) and ''Psycholinguistics'' (1993).{{r|ceiling}}
She is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and of the [[American Psychological Association]], and was president of the [[International Association for the Study of Child Language]] from 1990 to 1993, and of the [[Gypsy Lore Society]] 1996 to 1999.&lt;ref name=AboutTheAuthor&gt;{{cite book|editor-last2=Ratner|editor-first1=Jean Berko|editor-last1=Gleason |editor-first2=Nan Bernstein|title=The development of language |date=2009 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=9780205593033 |edition=7th |url=http://www.pearson.ch/HigherEducation/Communication/Speech-LanguagePathology/1471/9780132985321/Development-of-Language.aspx |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has also served on the editorial boards of numerous academic and professional journals, and was associate editor of ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' from 1997 to 1999.{{refn| name=cv}}

Gleason was profiled in ''Beyond the Glass Ceiling: Forty Women Whose Ideas Shape the Modern World'' (1996).{{refn|name=ceiling|{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meDtAAAAMAAJ |title=Beyond the Glass Ceiling: Forty Women Whose Ideas Shape the Modern World |editors=Sian Griffiths and Helena Kennedy |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0-7190-4773-2}}}}{{r|ceiling}}
A [[festschrift]] in her honor, ''Methods for Studying Language Production'', was published in 2000.{{r|beginning}}

==={{anchor|wugtest}}Children's learning of English morphology{{mdashb}}the Wug Test===
&lt;!--Wug test redirects here please retarget redirect if this section is renamed --&gt;
[[File:WugTest NowThereIsAnotherOne FairUseOnly.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|One of Gleason's hand-drawn panels from the original Wug Test (1958)]]

Gleason devised the Wug Test as part of her earliest research (1958), which used nonsense words to gauge children's acquisition of morphological rules{{mdashb}}for example, the "default" rule that most [[English plurals]] are formed by adding an {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}} or {{IPA|/ɨz/}} sounds, e.g., ''{{nobr|hat{{ndash}}hats,}} {{nobr|eye{{ndash}}eyes,}} {{nobr|witch{{ndash}}witches.}}''{{r|childs_learning}}
A child is shown simple pictures of an imaginary creature or activity,{{refn|&lt;!--&lt;&lt;BARE URL NEEDS FIXING--&gt;1=
[http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/topics/ Topics in Language Acquisition]
}}&lt;ref name=Balota&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Balota|editor-first1=David A.|editor-last2=Marsh|editor-first2=Elizabeth J.|title=Cognitive psychology: key readings|date=2004|publisher=Psychology press|location=Hove ; New York, N.Y.|isbn=1841690651|page=526|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0jjVEHoK20C&amp;pg=PA526}}&lt;/ref&gt;
with a nonsense name, and prompted to complete a statement about it:
:&lt;!--/:/ instead of /quote/ for consistency with bullet-list later--&gt;''This is a WUG. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two________.''{{r|childs_learning}}
A critical attribute of the test is that the "target" word be a made-up (but plausible-sounding) [[pseudoword]], so that the child will never have heard it before.
A child who knows that the plural of ''witch'' is ''witches'' may have heard and memorized that pair, but a child responding that the plural of ''wug'' (which the child presumably has never heard) is ''wugs'' (/wʌgz/, using the /z/ allomorph since "wug" ends in a voiced consonant) has apparently inferred (perhaps unconsciously) the basic rule for forming plurals.{{r|childs_learning}}{{efn-ua|
Very young children are baffled by the question, sometimes responding with ''two wug''. Preschoolers ages 4 to 5 test best in dealing with {{IPA|/z/}} after a voiced consonant, and generally say that there are two wugs, with a {{IPA|/z/}}; they do almost as well with the voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}. They do  less well in dealing with {{IPA|/z/}} in other environments such as after [[nasal consonants|nasals]], [[rhotics]], and vowels. Children in the first year of [[primary school]] were almost fully competent with both {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}.  Both preschool and first-grade children dealt poorly with {{IPA|/ɨz/}}, giving the correct answer less than half the time, possibly because it occurs in the most restrictive context. Also, because the root of the test word often ended in {{IPA|/s/}} in these cases, the children may have assumed that the word was already in its plural form. Even though the children were all able to produce the real plural "glasses" they generally responded two "tass" rather than two "tasses" when shown more than one nonsense creature called a "tass".{{r|childs_learning}}
}}

The Wug Test also includes questions involving verb conjugations, possessives, and other common derivational morphemes such as the [[agent noun|agentive]] ''-er'' (e.g. "A man who 'zibs' is a ________?"),
and requested explanations of common compound words e.g. "Why is a birthday called a birthday?"{{efn-ua
|{{r|childs_learning}} Preschoolers tend to form compounds rather than agentives e.g. a man whose job it is to "zib" is a ''zibman'', and often explain compound words in terms of their cultural, rather than linguistic, features e.g. a birthday is called ''birthday'' because one receives presents.}}
Other items included:
*''This is a dog with QUIRKS on him. He is all covered in QUIRKS. What kind of a dog is he? He is a ________ dog.''{{refn|name=onbeing|{{cite web

*''This is a man who knows how to SPOW. He is SPOWING. He did the same thing yesterday. What did he do yesterday? Yesterday he________.''{{r|onbeing}}
(The expected answers were ''QUIRKY'' and ''SPOWED''.){{r|childs_learning}}&lt;!--not sure "expected" is the right word here--&gt;

Gleason's major finding was that even very young children are able to connect suitable endings{{mdashb}}to produce plurals, past tenses, possessives, and other forms{{mdashb}}to nonsense words they have never heard before, implying that they have already internalized systematic aspects of the linguistic system which no one has necessarily tried to teach them.{{r|onbeing}}
However, she also identified an earlier stage at which children can produce such forms for real words, but not yet for nonsense words{{mdashb}}implying that children start by memorizing singular{{ndash}}plural pairs they hear spoken by others, then eventually extract rules and patterns from these examples which they apply to novel words.{{refn

}}

The Wug Test was the first experimental proof that young children have extracted generalizable rules from the language around them, rather than simply memorizing words that they have heard,{{refn
|name="pathways" |{{citation |last1=Karmiloff |first1=Kyra|first2= Annette|last2= Karmiloff-Smith|date=2001|title=Pathways to Language: From Fetus to Adolescent|publisher=  Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674008359}}}}{{r|beginning|page=2}} and it was almost immediately adapted for children speaking languages other than English, to bilingual children, and to children (and adults) with various impairments or from a variety of cultural backgrounds.{{r|beginning|page=3}} Its conclusions are viewed as essential to the understanding of when and how children reach major language milestones, and its variations and progeny remain in use worldwide for studies on language acquisition.{{r|beginning|page=8}} It is "almost universal" for textbooks in psycholinguistics and language acquisition to include assignments calling for the student to carry out a practical variation of the Wug Test paradigm.{{r|beginning|page=7}}

The Wug Test's fundamental role in the development of psycholinguistics as a discipline has been mapped by studying references to Gleason's work in "seminal journals" in the field, many of which carried articles referencing it in their founding issues:{{r|beginning|page=4}}
{{quote|A review of citation lists [for Gleason's paper] over the years gives an interesting mini-view of the evolution of developmental psycholinguistics... In the first 15 years following publication, the article was extensively cited by researchers attempting to validate its utility and extend its finding to nontypical populations. Over time, however... the fact that almost any human being can do that task... became much less interesting than the question of how it is accomplished.{{r|beginning|page=4}}}}

According to Ratner and Menn, "As an enduring concept in psycholinguistic research, the wug has become a generic, like [''kleenex''] or [''xerox''], a concept so basic to what we know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins... Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research."{{r|beginning|page=8}}

It has been proposed that Wug Test{{ndash}}like instruments be used in diagnosis of [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], but in practice success in this direction has been limited.{{r|beginning|page=4}}

===Parent–child interactions===

Another of Gleason's early papers "Fathers and Other Strangers: Men's Speech to Young Children" (1975) explored differences between mothers' and fathers' spoken interaction with their children, primarily using data produced by two female and two male daycare teachers at a large university, and by three mothers and three fathers, mostly during family dinners.
Among other conclusions, this study found that:
*mothers used less complex constructions in speaking to their children than did fathers;
*mothers generated lengthier and more complex constructions in speaking to their eldest child than to their younger children;
*fathers issued significantly more commands than did mothers, along with more threats and more teasing in the way of name{{hyp}}calling; and

In contrast, both male and female daycare teachers used language that was similar both quantitatively and qualitatively, with both focusing on dialogue based in the present and on the immediate needs of the children.
Differences included that the male teachers tended to address the children by name more often than did the female teachers, and that the male teachers issued more [[imperative mood|imperative]]s than did the female teachers.{{refn |name=Gleason1975|{{cite journal |last=Gleason|first=Jean Berko |title=Fathers and Other Strangers: Men's speech to Young Children |journal=26th Annual Roundtable |date=1975 |pages=289–297}} }}

===Acquisition of routines in children===

Gleason's research eventually extended into the study of children's acquisition of routines{{mdashb}}that is, standardized chunks of language (or language-plus-gesture) that the culture expects of everyone, such as greetings, farewells, and expressions of thanks.  Gleason was one of the first to study the acquisition of politeness, examining English-speaking children's use of routines such as ''thank you'', ''please'', and ''I'm sorry''. Researchers in this area have since studied both verbal and non-verbal routinization, and the development of politeness routines in a variety of cultures and languages.&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Matthews|editor-first1=Danielle |title=Pragmatic development in first language acquisition|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-9027234704|page=324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjTOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Halloween routine====

Gleason's 1976 paper with Weintraub, "The Acquisition of Routines in Child Language",
analyzed performance on the culturally standardized Halloween [[Trick-or-treat]] routine in 115 children aged two to sixteen years.
Alterations in ability and the function of parental contribution were analyzed concerning cognitive and social components.
They discovered that in the acquisition of routines
(in contrast to acquisition of much of the rest of language) parents' major interest is for their children to achieve accurate performance, with little stress on children's understanding of what they are expected to say.
Gleason and Weintraub found that the parents rarely if ever explain to children the meaning of such routines as ''Bye bye'' or ''Trick or treat''{{mdashb}}there was no concern with the child's thoughts or intentions as long as the routine was performed as expected at the appropriate times.
Thus, parents' role in the acquisition of routines is very different from their role in most of the rest of language development.{{refn

===="Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye"====
{{external media | float=right | width = 18em | align = right | headerimage=  | video1 = Jean Berko Gleason, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y7Vn9TEnM4 ''Hi,&amp;nbsp;Thanks, and Goodbye'']. NOVA's Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers}}&lt;!--review cite and presentation--&gt;

Gleason and Greif analyzed children's acquisition of three ubiquitous routines in "Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye: More Routine Information" (1980).
Subjects were eleven boys and eleven girls and their parents.
At the conclusion of a parent–child play period, an assistant entered the playroom bearing a present, in order to evoke routines from the children.
The study's purpose was to analyze how parents communicate these routines to their children; major questions proposed included whether or not some routines were more obligatory than others, and whether mothers and fathers provide different models of politeness behavior for their children. The results suggest that children's ''spontaneous'' construction of the three routines was low, with ''Thank you'' the rarest.
However, parents strongly encouraged their children to generate routines and, typically, the children complied.
In addition, parents were more likely to prompt the ''Thank you'' routine than the ''Hi'' and ''Goodbye'' routines.
Parents practiced the routines themselves, though mothers were more likely than fathers to speak ''Thank you'' and ''Goodbye'' to the assistant.{{refn

====Apologies====

Gleason and Ely made an in-depth study of apologies in children's dialogue in their paper, "I'm sorry I said that: apologies in young children's discourse" (2006),{{refn
|name=Gleason2006|{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Jean Berko|author2=Ely|title=I'm sorry I said that: apologies in young children's discourse|journal=Journal of Child Language|date=2006|pages=33, 599–620}}
}}
which analyzed apology term usage (in parent–child dialogue) of five boys and four girls, aged one to six years.
Their research suggested that apologies appear later in children than do other politeness routines, and that as the children grew older they developed a progressively refined expertise with this routine, gradually requiring fewer direct prompts and producing more elaborate apologies instead of just saying "I'm sorry".
They also found that parents and other adults play an important role in fostering growth of apologetic abilities through the setting of examples, by encouraging the children to apologize, and by speaking specifically and purposefully to them about apologies.{{refn|name=Gleason2006}}

====Attention to language in family discourse====

With Ely, MacGibbon, and Zaretsky, Gleason also explored the discourse of middle-class parents and their children at the dinner table in, "Attention to Language: Lessons Learned at the Dinner Table" (2001),
finding that the everyday language of these parents involves a remarkable portion of attention to language.
The dinner-table conversation of twenty{{hyp}}two middle-class families, each with a child between two years and five and one{{hyp}}half years old, were recorded,
then analyzed for the existence and activity of language{{hyp}}centered terms, including words like ''ask'', ''tell'', ''say'', and ''speak''.
Mothers spoke more about language than did fathers, and fathers spoke more about it than did children:
roughly eleven percent of mothers' sentences contained one or more language{{hyp}}centered terms, and the corresponding proportions for fathers and children were seven percent and four percent.
Uses that were metalinguistic (for example, accounting for and remarking on speech) exceeded uses that were pragmatic (for example, managing how and when speech appears).{{r|Gleason2001}}

The more that mothers used language-centered terms, the more the children did as well{{mdashb}}but this was not true for fathers.
The results imply that in routine family conversations, parents supply children with considerable information on the way language is used to communicate information.{{refn

===Foreign-language studies===

Gleason has carried out significant research involving the learning and maintenance of second languages by [[Sequential bilingualism|sequential bilinguals]]. She has studied the acquisition of a second language while retaining the first (additive bilingualism),{{refn

====Psychophysiological responses to taboo words====

An unusual study carried out with Harris and Aycicegi, "[[Taboo word]]s and reprimands elicit greater autonomic reactivity in a first language than in a second language" (2003), investigated the involuntary [[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] reactions of bilingual speakers to taboo words.
Thirty{{hyp}}two Turkish{{hyp}}English bilinguals judged an array of words and phrases for "pleasantness" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (their first language), and in English (their second), while their [[skin conductance]] was monitored via fingertip electrodes.
Participants manifested greater [[arousal|autonomic arousal]] in response to taboo words and childhood reprimands in their first language than to those in their second language, confirming the commonplace claim that speakers of two languages are less uncomfortable speaking taboo words and phrases in their second language than in their native language.{{refn

====Maintenance of first and second languages====

In "Maintaining Foreign Language Skills", which discusses "the personal, cultural, and instructional factors involved with keeping up foreign language skills" (1988), Gleason and Pan consider both humans' remarkable capacity for language acquisition and their ability to lose it.
In addition to brain damage, strokes, trauma and other physical causes of language loss, individuals may lose language skills due to the absence of a linguistically supportive social environment in which to maintain such skills, such as when a speaker of a given language relocates to a place where that language is not spoken. Culture also factors in. More often than not, individuals speaking two or more languages come into contact with one another, for reasons ranging from emigration and interrelationships to alterations in political borders. The result of such contact is typically that the community of speakers undergoes a progressive shift in usage from one language to the other.{{refn

===Aphasia===

Gleason has also done significant research on [[aphasia]],
a condition (usually due to [[brain injury]]) in which a person's ability to understand and/or to produce language, including their ability to find the words they need and their use of basic morphology and syntax, is impaired in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=Menn&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Menn|editor-first1=Lise|title=Agrammatic aphasia a cross-language narrative sourcebook|date=1990|publisher=J. Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789027273512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNFO3HAWIfMC&amp;pg=PA1932&amp;dq=Gleason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg1982&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Sheldon|title=Handbook of applied psycholinguistics|date=1982|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=9780898591736|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-PJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Some Linguistic Structures in the Speech of a Broca's Aphasic" (1972) Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde discuss an experiment carried out with a man who, after a [[stroke]], had been left with [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]]/[[agrammatism]],
a specific form of aphasia typically impairing the production of morphology and syntax more than it impairs comprehension.
This experiment employed the [[Story Completion Test]] (often used to probe a subject's capacity for producing various common grammatical forms)
as well as free conversation and repetition to elicit speech from the subject;
this speech was then analyzed to evaluate how well he used inflectional morphology
(e.g. plural and past tense word endings) and basic syntax (the formation of, for example, simple [[declarative sentence|declarative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], and [[interrogative]] sentences).{{r|Gleason1972}}

To do this the investigator, in a few sentences, began a simple story about a pictured situation, then asked the subject to conclude the narrative.
The stories were so designed that a non{{ndash}}language{{hyp}}impaired person's response would typically employ particular structures, for example the plural of a noun, the past tense of a verb, or a simple but complete yes{{hyp}}no question (e.g. "Did you take my shoes?").{{r|Gleason1972}}

Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde concluded that the transition from verb to object was easier for this subject than was the transition from subject to verb, and
that [[auxiliary verb]]s and verb [[inflection]]s were the parts of speech most likely to be omitted by the subject. There was considerable variation among consecutive repeat trials of the same test item, although responses on successive attempts usually came closer to those a normal speaker would have produced.
The study concluded that the subject's speech was not the product of a stable abnormal grammar, and could not be accounted for by assuming that he was simply omitting words to minimize his effort in producing them{{refn

'''Kursenieki language'''&lt;ref name="Kiseliunaite"/&gt; (Kursenieki: ''Kursisk valuod''; {{lang-lv|Kursenieku valoda}}) or '''Couronian language of Couronian isthmus'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Skujiņa|first=Valentīna|year=2007|title=Valodniecības pamatterminu skaidrojošā vārdnīca |url=http://termini.lza.lv/term.php?term=kursenieku%20valoda |location=Riga |publisher=Latvian Language Agency|page=|isbn=978-99-849-8369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Nehrungskurisch}} – 'Spit Curonian') is a dialect of the [[Latvian language]] spoken by the [[Kursenieki]] of the [[Curonian Spit]], a thin strip of land stretching between southwestern Lithuania and Russia. In the process of various migrations of the 14th–17th centuries, [[Curonians]] (already speaking a Latvian dialect) settled along the Curonian Spit in [[East Prussia]] and became known as [[Kursenieki]].

[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|left|200px|In 1649 settlement of the Kursenieki language speaking Kursenieki spanned from [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]] to [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]] in [[Poland]].]]
Kursenieki language was influenced by [[Old Prussian]], [[Low German Language|Low German]], [[German language|High German]] and [[Samogitian dialect|the Samogitian dialect]] successively, and by the end of the 18th century new Curonian dialects had formed, with the dialect of the Curonian Spit being notably distinct, due to its isolation from the mainland. Kursenieki vocabulary published in 1927 shows: 60% of Curonian words were the same as Latvian, 26% were loanwords from “German” (i.e. Low German and High German), and 13% from Lithuanian dialects. The Kursenieki language is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Latvian, especially with its southwestern dialects, and Latvians can communicate easily with Kursenieki today.&lt;ref&gt;Pietsch, Richard: Deutsch-Kurisches Wörterbuch, Verlag Nordostdeutsches Kulturwerk Lüneburg 1991, p.17, {{ISBN|3-922296-60-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], the Kursenieki language was a [[sociolect]] of Curonian fishermen of the Curonian Spit. In other spheres of everyday life Kursenieki used the Low German and High German languages.  
The events of the first half of the 20th century, including the Soviet and German [[Occupation of Baltic states|occupations of the Baltic states]] and later [[East Prussia]], led to the near extinction of the language, making it [[endangered language|severely endangered]]. Several remaining native speakers live in [[Germany]], having been [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] as "Germans" in the [[Evacuation of East Prussia|ethnic cleansing that took place in East Prussia]] after [[World War II]].

'''Latrinalia''' is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made on [[latrine]]s: that is, bathrooms or lavatory walls.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/garden/03punk.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977282759&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/music/blogs/stop-the-presses/rock-scariest-bathroom-immortalized-cbgb-movie-180133133.html&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of [[art]], [[drawing]]s, or [[language|word]]s, including [[poetry]] and personal reflections. Other types of latrinalia include political commentary as well as derogatory comments and pictures. When done without the [[property]] owner's [[consent]], it constitutes [[vandalism]]. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the lavatory large [[blackboard]]s and providing free [[chalk]]; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.212.44.5/storys01.php?storyid=3407 Golden Gate [X&amp;#93;Press Online | R.I.P.

==Etymology==
The late [[Alan Dundes]], a folklorist at [[University of California, Berkeley]], coined the term ''latrinalia'' in 1966 to refer to [[graffiti]] found in restrooms.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes"&gt;{{cite paper | author=[[Alan Dundes|Dundes, Alan]] | title=Here I Sit &amp;mdash; A Study of American Latrinalia | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]: Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers | date=1966 | url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120032605/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | archivedate=2005-11-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dundes preferred it over the term ''shithouse poetry'', as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes" /&gt;

The word is derived from the [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] of ''latrine'' (or toilet) and the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-alia'', which signifies a worthless collection of something &amp;mdash; in this case bathroom writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29981">The '''MOGUL framework'''  is a research framework aiming to provide a theoretical perspective on the nature of language. MOGUL (Modular On-line Growth and Use of Language) draws on the common ground underlying various related areas of cognitive science including psycholinguistics, [[theoretical linguistics]], first- and second-language acquisition, [[neurolinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]]; it is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research.

The MOGUL framework's background assumption is that the mind is composed of [[expert systems]] which have evolved over time, one of which is responsible for human linguistic ability. Historically, scientific studies of language have been divided between many sub-disciplines; theoretical linguists focus on the abstract properties of language&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers in other fields investigate how language is used and processed in real time: either in psychological terms or (in the case of neurolinguistics) through a study of the physical systems of neurons in the brain. Each field of study has developed its own research traditions and technical vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate insights across disciplines. The MOGUL Framework represents an attempt to identify common themes and compatible approaches in different (but related fields), and hence to facilitate integration.

==Overview==
MOGUL is designed as a platform for the generation of new hypotheses, with a terminology and a set of interrelated concepts that can be used across more than one discipline. Although not a full-fledged theory in its own right, it sets out various theoretical claims based on the current literature in a range of research domains. As suggested below it is not connectionist in the most widely used sense of that term, although it employs terms and concepts familiar to connectionists such as competition, activation, activation levels and so forth. The same processing perspective also requires the long-established Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance to be viewed in a somewhat different way. [[Linguistic competence]] (knowledge) is not compartmentalised and placed in a separate box in the model, which then forms the object for a processor (or processors) to act on. Rather, it is instantiated and implicit within the processing system. The distinction between mental representation and processing is still valid, but is expressed in a way that ought to allow the abstract properties of linguistic systems in the mind to be more easily investigated in conjunction with real-time linguistic phenomena. The inspiration for this approach is the work of [[Ray Jackendoff]]. Here the architecture of the [[language faculty]] is formulated in such a way as to facilitate statements about competence-related, representational issues and their relationship to real-time language processing within the same model.

==Scope==
Empirical evidence for the claims and assumptions set out in MOGUL rests essentially on the experimental findings of the various fields of research on which it is based. The MOGUL framework queries current solutions and raises new questions based upon this body of evidence, in the hope that answers to such questions will be sought in the related areas by appropriate researchers.

More specifically, MOGUL represents an attempt to provide ways of investigating how first- or second-language processing relates to linguistic development and how language in the monolingual and multilingual language user is situated within human cognitive architecture in general. What exactly happens, even in milliseconds, when someone is exposed to the sights and sounds of a new language? How do we explain what gets noticed and what gets regularly ignored? What about the fixed stages that people seem to pass though? How is it that we have so little conscious control over what we are attempting to acquire? Why do children appear to be worse language learners in the short run and much better in the long run? How can two or more language systems cohabit in one mind? Answers to these questions require an interdisciplinary approach. Two major sources for inspiration for the approach described here are the ideas of [[Generative linguistics|generative linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] on language faculty and modularity and [[Global Workspace Theory]], as advanced by [[Bernard Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars 1988, 1997; Jackendoff 1987, 2002, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first MOGUL publication was released in 2004 and was a keynote article in ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, J &amp; M. Sharwood Smith. (2004). Acquisition by processing: a modular  perspective on language development. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' 7,1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to situate languages within a wider cognitive context, the MOGUL framework is designed to provide a basic architecture that purports to explain how (in general terms) the mind functions. This means that it is not an account of brain function, although it is set out in such a way that might facilitate such accounts.

==Modules, processing units and working memory==
Briefly, MOGUL architecture follows Jackendoff in positing a generic cognitive module (or, in MOGUL, a processing unit) which consists of an integrative processor operating on structural elements (structures) in a memory store. Specifically, it works with activated elements that are raised into working memory from that memory store.

[[File:gen processor.jpg|300px|thumb|MOGUL architecture|alt=Diagram of MOGUL linguistic theory]]Modules are only somewhat generic in structure; the rest is very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of [[working memory]] as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: it is part of the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory "surface" within the same store.  In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley 2007, Cowan 1999, Nairne 2002 and Paradis 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from – and independent of – for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a MOGUL module (based on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see "MOGUL architecture in a nutshell" below).

This functional architecture may be neurally and anatomically instantiated in different ways: the design of systems such as that proposed by Jackendoff and others (including MOGUL) involves no specific claims about the precise nature and location of the neural system. These are two different levels of description. The auditory module (translated into cortical terms) involves several brain regions distributed across the supratemporal plane; activation in MOGUL terms (when translated into neurological terms) may involve both excitatory and inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, functional auditory structure (as described within the MOGUL framework) must be distinguished from anatomical and physiological auditory structure.

==Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT)==
An important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the [[parser]]. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only [[language acquisition]] and [[language attrition]] (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, W. (2005). Syntactic Carpentry: An Emergentist Approach to Syntax. Mahwah, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, the claim is that all development is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated.  Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word "ship" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying "sheep" and "shape" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener).&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The "ship" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic "use it or lose it" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole.

As we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned.

Although the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each module is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant modules (processing units) are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. MOGUL espouses both [[modularity]] of mind and a constrained form of [[connectionism]] with a complex web of expert systems, each with its own particular organising principles. In this way, MOGUL makes claims not only about language abilities but about the mind in general.

==Comprehension and production==
The core modules involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Phonological, syntactic and conceptual processing work in one direction in response to visual and auditory events in the environment (typically in listening to speech or reading a text), but they also work in the other direction to produce speech or writing (or messages in [[sign language]]). Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures.  Meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in [[Writing system|writing]] or signing.

When the basic direction of processing is, say, from conceptual structure to speech, the assembling of an appropriate structural chain is not carried out in a rigid unidirectional sequence; at different levels, different options will be available and compete for selection. In production, some options may be partially formed and then be dropped in favour of a better-fitting rival structure. In this way the ultimate structural chain is built up incrementally, out of the more accessible candidate structures that happen to provide the best overall fit at the time. Comprehension works according to the same principles, with parallel processing and split-second editing and revising until a best-fit interpretation is arrived at. It may be the wrong interpretation but it will be the best fit, given the person's current processing resources at that particular moment in time.

As an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage – in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus [[Syntax|syntactic structure]]) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in "a boy hit the ball", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain.  As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles.  Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure).

==Perception and affect (PopS and AfS)==
One feature of the MOGUL approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of [[perception]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of "a boy hit the ball" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept "boy". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co-activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. MOGUL follows the view that high levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of ''perceptual output structures'' (POpS).

POpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses – or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in MOGUL are ''visual structures'' (VS) and ''auditory structures'' (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word "dog" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully.

Perceptual output structures are strongly interconnected. This enables a coordinated responses to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, since POpS mediate between the external environment and the internal operations of the mind that are inaccessible to awareness, POpS conform closely with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, a hypothetical prerequisite for awareness to occur. It is also reflected in the condition known as [[synaesthesia]]: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. Another example of connection is provided by the experimentally-induced [[McGurk effect]]. Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips).

The main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word "dog" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its ''conceptual structure''(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do ''not'' have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and ''cannot'') achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature.

The affective system works with ''affective structures'' (AfS) that are constructed using primitives such as "fear" and "disgust", which are discussed in [[affective neuroscience]] in the work of [[António Damásio]].&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; AfS are connected to POpS and contribute directly to appropriate responses of the organism to events in the immediate environment, to its chances of survival and to the experience of conscious awareness. Making these aspects of mental life more explicit helps researchers to understand and devise hypotheses about how consciousness and emotion affect online language performance and language acquisition. By the same token, it should help to show how certain aspects of language behaviour are (or might be) immune to such influence.

==Knowing a language==
Language is a vague term and is its widest sense involves a host of different processing units, only some of which are what makes human language unique to this species, that is, the phonological and syntactic expert systems that make up what, in [[generative linguistics]], is called the [[language module]] and whose special properties are often subsumed under the name [[Universal Grammar]]. Closely associated with this core system, but not part of the language module per se, are a rich set of conceptual structures developed over the lifespan, as also b) auditory structures that have been matched up with phonological structures and c) visual structures created for interpreting writing and sign language. In addition, there are the various motor structures involved in the production of language in its different modes. One might lump all of this together and call it ''knowledge of language''. None of it, however, constitutes 'knowledge of language' if, by this term, we rather mean language that we can think and talk about and analyse, in other words ''metalinguistic knowledge'', which, as with all forms of [[metacognition]], is constructed out of conceptual structure and various perceptual output structures. [[File:metaroute.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Linguistic diagram]]To take a simple example, the word "horse" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the  sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning as illustrated in the figure on the right. Not represented in the figure is the additional conceptual structure (over above the meaning of horse itself), consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as ''word, syllable, noun, definition'' and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the language module is not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. In the MOGUL version of metalinguistic processing, the essential chain of connections that are assembled completely bypasses the PS and SS systems. Processing within the language module will always kick in automatically on exposure of language stimuli, but metalinguistic (explicit) activity is processed elsewhere. Following the standard arguments from [[learnability]] theory as applied in [[generative linguistics]], the language module is nevertheless crucial for all other types of linguistic activity and is vital for explaining the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; No amount of activation of auditory and conceptual structure alone can explain the growth of language in the mind following repeated exposure to speech, most obviously in the case of little children and (arguably) adults as well.

Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be "right" or "wrong". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however.  An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.

==MOGUL architecture in a nutshell==
In this figure, the MOGUL version of the cognitive system is sketched in simplified form. The circles or ovals represent specialised processors, and the rectangular boxes each represent the particular memory store of structures which they are designed to handle. Affective structures (AfS) are not differentiated in this figure. Also, for simplicity's sake, only five "senses" are portrayed in the POpS system. All languages are handled by the same syntactic and phonological processors, but different languages will involve both shared and unique ''syntactic structures'' (SS) and ''phonological structures'' (PS) residing in (respectively) their syntactic and phonological memory stores. Mental activity is characterised by the formation of chains or networks of structures across different modules. This is achieved by means of interface processors (the dotted arrows) following Jackendoff (1987). These are bimodular, in that they match elements in two adjacent modules; they can only access and link certain structural elements in one or the other module. Moreover, the matching is not a "translation" of one element into terms (the code) of another system; there is no exchange of information, merely a chaining of elements that can otherwise only be processed within its own particular processing unit or module.

__NOTOC__

'''Maranatha''' (Aramaic: either מרנא תא: '''''maranâ thâ' ''''' or מרן אתא: '''''[[maran]] 'athâ' ''''', Greek: Μαραναθα) is a two-word [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] formula occurring [[Hapax legomenon|only once]] in the [[New Testament]] (''see [[Aramaic of Jesus#Maranatha (Μαραναθα)|Aramaic of Jesus]]''). It appears in [[Didache]] 10:14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html|title=Didache. The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (translation J. B. Lightfoot).|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is part of the [[Apostolic Fathers]]' collection. It is [[transliterated]] into Greek letters rather than [[translated]] and, given the nature of early manuscripts, the lexical difficulty rests in determining just which two Aramaic words constitute the single Greek expression, found at the end of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s ''[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]'' ([http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm 1 Cor 16:22]).

If one chooses to split the two words as מרנא תא (maranâ thâ), a vocative concept with an imperative verb, then it can be translated as a command to the [[Names of God|Lord]] to come. On the other hand, if one decides that the two words מרן אתא ([[maran]] 'athâ), a possessive "Our Lord" and a perfect/preterite verb "has come," are actually more warranted, then it would be seen as a credal expression. This interpretation, "Our Lord has come," is supported by what appears to be an equivalent of this in the early credal acclamation found in the biblical books of Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 12:3, "Jesus is Lord."

[[File:Soliloquies OE - maranatha (British Library Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, folio 5r).jpg|thumb|left|A mention of maranatha in the ''Southwick Codex'', a medieval text]]
In general, the recent interpretation has been to select the command option ("Come, Lord!"), changing older decisions to follow the preterite option ("Our Lord has come") as found in the ancient Aramaic [[Peshitta]], in the Latin [[Clementine Vulgate]], in the Greek Byzantine texts, maranatha ("O Lord, come!" in 1Co 16:22), which was part of the eucharistic dialogue of the early Church. [[Textus Receptus]], critical Greek texts like Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, Cambridge, etc., and in the English translations like the [[King James Version]], the Finnish Raamattu, etc. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] of 1 Cor 16:22 translates the expression as: "Our Lord, come!" but notes that it could also be translated as: "Our Lord has come"; the [[New International Version|NIV]] translates: "Come, O Lord"; the ''[[The Message (Bible)|Message]]'' version puts it differently as: "Make room for the Master!" [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+16%3A22&amp;version=MSG]; the [[New American Bible|NAB]] notes:

{{quote|As understood here ("O Lord, come!"), it is a [[Prayer in the New Testament|prayer]] for the early [[Second Coming|return of Christ]]. If the Aramaic words are divided differently (Maran atha, "Our Lord has come"), it becomes a [[Creed|credal]] declaration. The former interpretation is supported by what appears to be a Greek equivalent of this acclamation in [[Book of Revelation]] 22:20 "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!"}}

The 1985 [[New Jerusalem Bible]] translates 1 Cor 16:22, "If there is anyone who does not love the Lord, a curse on such a one. Maran atha." In the context of 1 Corinthians, understanding the Greek "maranatha" as Aramaic "Maran atha" in the [[preterite]] sense would provide substantiation for the preceding [[anathema]]. That is, one who does not love the Lord is accursed because our Lord has ascended and come unto his throne (e.g., Dan 7:13). It would also substantiate the following prayer for grace from the ascended Lord Jesus, who has come to his throne and then sends the [[Holy Spirit]]. {{Citation needed|reason=July 2016|date=July 2016}}

The last chapter of the Book of Revelation makes use of the same concept as מרנא תא "marana tha" by the Greek ἔρχου κύριε Ἰησοῦ (Rev. 22:20 [[NA28]]) "erchou kurie Iesou", "Come, Lord Jesus."

In the [[Catholic Church]], the word "Maranatha" has also been used as a solemn formula of [[excommunication]] (alongside "[[anathema]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01455e.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Anathema|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Contemplative Prayer==
Based on the teachings of [[John Cassian]], [[John Main]] recommended the recitation of ''Maranatha'' as “the ideal Christian [[mantra]]”, meaning “Come Lord”, repeated silently interiorly as four equally stressed syllables ''Ma-ra-na-tha'': “Not only is this one of the most ancient Christian prayers, in the language Jesus spoke, but it also has a harmonic quality that helps to [[hesychasm|bring the mind to silence]]. Other words or short phrases could be used but he saw it as important that during the meditation one doesn't think about the meaning or use the imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theschoolofmeditation.org/content/john-main-biography&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian authors and communities cultivate similar practices centred on this recitation.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

'''Nativization''' is the process whereby a [[language]] gains [[native speaker]]s.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} This happens necessarily where a [[second language]] used by adult parents becomes the [[native language]] of their children. Nativization has been of particular interest to [[linguists]], and to [[creolist]]s more specifically, where the second language concerned is a [[pidgin]].

Several explanations of [[Creole language|creole]] genesis have relied on prior nativization of a pidgin as a stage in achieving creoleness. This is true for [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Hall's]] (1966) notion of the pidgin-creole life cycle as well as [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton]]'s [[The Language Bioprogram theory|language bioprogram theory]].{{sfnp|Hall|1966}}{{sfnp|Bickerton|1984}}

There are few undisputed examples of a creole arising from nativization of a pidgin by children.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}}{{sfnp|Pfaff|1981}} The [[Tok Pisin]] language reported by {{Harvcoltxt|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} is one example where such a conclusion could be reached by scientific observation.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} A counterexample is the case where children of [[Gastarbeiter]] parents speaking pidgin German acquired German seamlessly without creolization.{{sfnp|Pfaff|1981}} Broad treatments of [[creolization]] phenomena such as {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} acknowledge now as a matter of standard that the pidgin-nativization scheme is only one of many explanations with possible theoretical validity.{{sfnp|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}

A '''one-syllable article''' ({{zh|c=同音文章|p=Tóngyīn wénzhāng}}) is a type of [[constrained writing]] found in [[Chinese literature]]. It takes advantage of the large number of [[Chinese language#Homophones|homophones in the Chinese language]], particularly when writing in [[Classical Chinese]] due to historic sound changes. While the [[Chinese character|characters]] used in a one-syllable article have many different meanings, they are all pronounced as the same syllable, although not with the same [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Therefore, a one-syllable article is comprehensible in writing but becomes an incomprehensible [[tongue twister]] when read aloud, especially in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation. In other regional pronunciations not all syllables may sound alike.

==Notable examples==
&lt;!--Someone who is more competent in Classical Chinese should check these English translations and fix any issues that are present, as they might not be as good as they should be.--&gt;
&lt;!--we should clarify the part about reading them aloud and reading. Can one comprehend a spoken form?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4506">The '''“one person, one language” approach''' is a popular method adopted by parents attempting to raise [[simultaneous bilingualism|simultaneous bilingual]] children. With the “one person, one language” approach, each parent consistently speaks only one of the two languages to the child. For instance, the child’s mother might speak to him or her exclusively in French, while the father might use only English.

==Reasoning==
Traditionally, the “one person, one language” method has been regarded as the best method for bilingual [[language acquisition]] free of [[code-switching|mixed utterances]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
The term “one person, one language” was first introduced by the French [[linguist]] [[Maurice Grammont]] in 1902. He theorized that by separating the languages from the beginning, parents could prevent confusion and [[code-mixing]] in their bilingual children.&lt;ref&gt;Barron-Hauwaert 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Saunders wrote in his book ''Bilingual Children: From Birth to Teens'' that the “one person, one language” approach “ensures that the children have regular exposure to and have to make use of each language. This is particularly important for the [[minority language]], which has little outside support."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 1988, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method has also been linked to an early development of [[metalinguistic awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In a study published in the ''Infant Mental Health Journal'', Naomi Goodz found that fathers tend to adhere more strictly to the “one person, one language model" than mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Goodz 1989, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when parents reported strictly following a “one person, one language” scheme, [[naturalistic observation]]s found repeated instances of language mixing in both parents.&lt;ref&gt;De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masae Takeuchi conducted research on 25 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] mothers in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] who were using the one person, one language approach to support their children's Japanese/English bilingual development.  Takeuchi found that consistency is the key to the success of the approach.  Most of the children in Takeuchi's study did not end up using Japanese actively after leaving school and only those children who were raised by mothers who consistently insisted on speaking only Japanese went on to use Japanese actively as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Maesae|title=The Japanese Language Development of Children through the 'One Parent-One Language' Approach in Melbourne|journal=The Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|year=2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=319–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Statement
! Other names
|-
| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}
| Syllables must have no codas.
| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Tableau
! colspan="2" | Input !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3

|}

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Name !! Description
|-
| rowspan="2" | Markedness || *SS || Two successive sibilants are prohibited. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[sibilants]] in the output.
|-
| {{sc1|Agree}}(Voice) || Output segments agree in specification of [[Distinctive feature|&amp;#91;±voice&amp;#93;]]. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[obstruent]]s in the output which disagree in voicing.
|-
| rowspan="3" | Faithfulness || {{sc1|Max}} || Maximizes all input segments in the output. One violation for each segment in the input that does not appear in the output. This constraint prevents deletion.
|-
| {{sc1|Dep}} || Output segments are dependent on having an input correspondent. One violation for each segment in the output that does not appear in the input. This constraint prevents insertion.
|-
| {{sc1|Ident}}(Voice) || Maintains the identity of the [±voice] specification. One violation for each segment that differs in voicing between the input and output.

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parallel text''' is a text placed alongside its translation or translations.  '''Parallel text alignment''' is the identification of the corresponding sentences in both halves of the parallel text. The [[Loeb Classical Library]] and the [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] are two examples of dual-language series of texts. Reference [[Bible translations|Bibles]] may contain the original languages and a translation, or several translations by themselves, for ease of comparison and study; [[Origen]]'s [[Hexapla]] (Greek for "sixfold") placed six versions of the Old Testament side by side.  The most famous example is the [[Rosetta Stone]].

Large collections of parallel texts are called '''parallel corpora''' (see [[text corpus]]). Alignments of parallel corpora at sentence level are prerequisite for many areas of [[linguistics|linguistic]] research. 
During translation, sentences can be split, merged, deleted, inserted or reordered by the translator. This makes alignment a non-trivial task.

==Types of parallel corpora==

Four main corpora types can be distinguished.

A ''noisy parallel corpus'' contains bilingual sentences that are not perfectly aligned or have poor quality translations. Nevertheless, most of its contents are bilingual translations of a specific document.

A ''comparable corpus'' is built from non-sentence-aligned and untranslated bilingual documents, but the documents are topic-aligned.

A ''quasi-comparable corpus'' includes very heterogeneous and non-parallel bilingual documents that may or may not be topic-aligned.

The rarest parallel corpora are corpora that contain translations of the same document into two or more languages, aligned at the sentence level at least.

==Noise in corpora==

Large corpora used as training sets for [[machine translation]] algorithms are usually extracted from large bodies of similar sources, such as databases of news articles written in the first and second languages describing similar events.

However, extracted fragments may be noisy, with extra elements inserted in each corpus. Extraction techniques can differentiate between [[bilingual]] elements represented in both corpora and [[monolingual]] elements represented in only one corpus in order to extract cleaner parallel fragments of bilingual elements. Comparable corpora are used to directly obtain knowledge for translation purposes. High-quality parallel data is difficult to obtain, however, especially for under-resourced languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | title = Noisy-Parallel and Comparable Corpora Filtering Methodology for the Extraction of Bi-Lingual Equivalent Data at Sentence Level | journal = Computer Science | year = 2015 | issue = 16.2 | pages = 169–184 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitext ==
{{main|Bitext word alignment}}
In the field of [[translation studies]] a '''bitext''' is a merged document composed of both source- and target-language versions of a given text.

Bitexts are generated by a piece of software called an ''alignment tool'', or a ''bitext tool'', which automatically aligns the original and translated versions of the same text. The tool generally matches these two texts sentence by sentence. A collection of bitexts is called a ''bitext database'' or a ''bilingual corpus'', and can be consulted with a search tool.

===Bitexts and translation memories===
The concept of the ''bitext'' shows certain similarities with that of the [[translation memory]]. Generally, the most salient difference between a bitext and a translation memory is that a translation memory is a database in which its segments (matched sentences) are stored in a way that is totally unrelated to their original context; the original sentence order is lost. A bitext retains the original sentence order. However, some implementations of translation memory, such as [[Translation Memory eXchange]] (TMX), a standard [[XML]] format for exchanging translation memories between [[computer-assisted translation]] (CAT) programs, allow preserving the original order of sentences.

Bitexts are designed to be consulted by a human [[translation|translator]], not by a machine. As such, small alignment errors or minor discrepancies that would cause a translation memory to fail are of no importance.

In his original 1988 article, Harris also posited that bitext represents how translators hold their source and target texts together in their mental working memories
as they progress. However, this hypothesis has not been followed up.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, B. ''[http://mt-archive.info/LangMonthly-54-1988-Harris.pdf Bi-text, a new concept in translation theory]'', Language Monthly (UK)
54, p. 8-10, March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pattern language''' is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise. The term was coined by architect [[Christopher Alexander]] and popularized by his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.

A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. Aliveness is one placeholder term for "the quality that has no name": a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Christopher |title=The Timeless Way of Building |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-502402-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates{{who|date=March 2016}} of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.

==What is a pattern?==
{{See also|Design pattern}}
When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the [[syntax]]), and use (the [[grammar]]) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Each such entry is a single [[design pattern]]. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern's contexts.

Elemental or universal ''patterns'' such as "door" or "partnership" are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, J. [http://www.synapse9.com/pub/2015_PURPLSOC-JLHfinalpub.pdf Guiding Patterns of Naturally Occurring Design: Elements. PURPLSOC 2015 proceedings, July 3-5 2015 Krems, Austria] PURPLSOC meeting on the many open scientific questions, e.g. regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all languages, a pattern language has [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[grammar]] – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
* The language description – the ''vocabulary'' – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called ''design patterns''. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
* Each solution includes ''syntax'', a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
* The solution includes ''grammar'' that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
* In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander's book ''A Pattern Language'', the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
* The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside.

==Many patterns form a language==
Just as [[words]] must have [[Grammar|grammatical]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] relationships to each other in order to make a spoken [[language]] useful, design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language. Christopher Alexander's work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. Occasionally, the smaller problems have no solution, and a different larger solution must be selected. Eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders, and the "design" is done.

The actual organizational structure ([[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Iterative method|iterative]], etc.) is left to the discretion of the designer, depending on the problem. This explicitly lets a designer explore a design, starting from some small part. When this happens, it's common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution. At this point, the design almost always becomes a better design.

In the language, therefore, each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole. This gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved.

The most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, empowered users,&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Christopher, The Oregon Project&lt;/ref&gt; as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to empower users of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.

==Design problems in a context==
An important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system (that may be a house, a computer program or an object of daily use), and to assist in the design of future systems. The idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context, but still specific enough to give constructive guidance.

The range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context. An important part in each pattern is to describe this context. Examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation.

For instance, Alexander's pattern "A PLACE TO WAIT" addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery, while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions. The [[Design Patterns|"Gang-of-Four" book ''Design Patterns'']] by Gamma et al. proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language, and the program's application domain.

Still, the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side, and specificity on the other side. In the end this depends on the author's preferences. However, even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are, by nature, absolutely concrete and specific.

Patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world. Alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero, one or two stars, indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples. It is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples. It is, however, conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern-like format.

The patterns in Alexander's book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood, others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms. Alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world, so they can be connected to a [[#Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)|hierarchic network]].

===Balancing of forces===
A pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve, the context or situation where these problems arise, and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended.

Often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or "forces". A pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision.

For instance, there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone. The forces would be the need to communicate, and the need to get other things done at the same time (cooking, inspecting the bookshelf). A very specific pattern would be just "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". More general patterns would be "WIRELESS DEVICE" or "SECONDARY ACTIVITY", suggesting that a secondary activity (such as talking on the phone, or inspecting the pockets of your jeans) should not interfere with other activities.

Though quite unspecific in its context, the forces in the "SECONDARY ACTIVITY" pattern are very similar to those in "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". Thus, the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern.

===Patterns contain their own rationale===
Usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values. For Christopher Alexander, it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture. One of his key values is making these people feel more alive. He talks about the "quality without a name" (QWAN).

More generally, we could say that a good system should be accepted, welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it, or – even better – by all people it affects. For instance, when discussing a street café, Alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest, but also mentions people who just walk by.

The same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars, to social structures like a team working on a project, or to the user interface of a computer program. The qualities of a software system, for instance, could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system.

By focusing on the impacts on human life, we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology, and thus find "timeless quality" (Alexander).

==Generic structure and layout==
Usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains, breaking each into generic sections like context, problem statement, solution etc.

Christopher Alexander's patterns, for instance, each consist of a short name, a rating (up to two '*' symbols), a sensitizing picture, the context description, the problem statement, a longer part of text with examples and explanations, a solution statement, a sketch and further references. This structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the "Alexandrian form".

Alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns. For instance, the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font, the latter is always preceded by the "Therefore:" keyword. Some authors instead use explicit labels, which creates some degree of redundancy.

===Meaningful names===
When design is done by a team, pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share. This makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive. Some examples from Alexander's works are WINDOW PLACE (helps define where windows should go in a room) and A PLACE TO WAIT (helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms, for example).

==Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)==
A pattern language, as conceived by Alexander, contains links from one pattern to another, so when trying to apply one pattern in a project, a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context.

In Alexander's book, such links are collected in the "references" part, and echoed in the linked pattern's "context" part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph. A pattern that is linked to in the "references" usually addresses a problem of lower scale, that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem. For instance, the "PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM" pattern has a reference to "STAIR SEATS".

Even without the pattern description, these links, along with meaningful names, carry a message: When building a place outside where people can spend time ("PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM"), consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ("STAIR SEATS"). If you are planning an office ("WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES"), consider to arrange workspaces in small groups ("SMALL WORKING GROUPS"). Alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves.

The links in Alexander's book clearly result in a hierarchic network. Alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern ''language''.

The idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors, though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary. Some authors, however, like Gamma et al. in ''[[Design Patterns]]'', make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns. In such a case we would speak of a ''pattern catalogue'' rather than a ''pattern language''.&lt;ref name="dearden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andy Dearden, Janet Finlay | title = Pattern Languages in HCI: A critical review | date = January 2006 | journal = Human Computer Interaction | volume = 21 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own. In order to enable this, his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering; he also explains the general method of pattern languages. The original concept for the book ''A Pattern Language'' was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder, so that pages could easily be added later; this proved impractical in publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory
Symposium 2009, presentation by 4 of 6 original authors of ''A Pattern Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields. Some examples are [[Design pattern (architecture)|architectural patterns]], [[Design pattern (computer science)|computer science patterns]], [[interaction design pattern]]s, [[pedagogical patterns]],  social action patterns, and group facilitation patterns. The pattern language approach has also been recommended as a way to promote [[civic intelligence]] by helping to coordinate actions for diverse people and communities who are working together on significant shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;For additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments, see: {{cite web |last=Schuler |first=Douglas |url=http://publicsphereproject.org/sites/default/files/Critical%20Enablers%20of%20Civic%20Intelligence.reduced.pdf |title=Choosing success: pattern languages as critical enablers of civic intelligence |publisher=Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory Conference, Portland, OR, 2009 |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential, and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields.

It is important to note that notations such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or the [[flowchart]] symbol collection are not pattern languages. They could more closely be compared to an alphabet: their symbols could be used to document a pattern language, but they are not a language by themselves. A [[recipe]] or other sequential set of steps to be followed, with only one correct path from start to finish, is also not a pattern language. However, the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language.

===Simple example of a pattern===
*''Name'': ChocolateChipRatio
*''Context'': You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
*''Consider these patterns first'': SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
*''Problem'': Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
*''Solution'': Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.
*''Consider next'': NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod

==Origin==
[[Christopher Alexander]], an architect and author, coined the term pattern language.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], USA | isbn = 0-19-501919-9 | last = Alexander | first = Christopher | title = A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction | year = 1977 | page = 1216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to refer to common problems of the [[design]] and [[construction]] of buildings and towns and how they should be solved. The solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room.

The framework and philosophy of the "pattern language" approach was initially popularized in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' that was written by Christopher Alexander and five colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California in the late 1970s. While ''A Pattern Language'' contains 253 "patterns" from the first pattern, "Independent Regions" (the most general) to the last, "Things from Your Life", Alexander's book ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work. The following definitions of "pattern" and "pattern language" are paraphrased from ''A Pattern Language''&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;:

"A ''pattern'' is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context, describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;

A ''pattern language'' is a network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions.

== Application domains ==
Christopher Alexander's idea has been adopted in other disciplines, often much more heavily than the original [[Pattern (architecture)|application of patterns to architecture]] as depicted in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt; Recent examples include [[software design pattern]]s in software engineering and, more generally, [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural patterns in computer science]], as well as [[interaction design pattern]]s. [[Pedagogical patterns]] are used to document good practices in teaching. The book ''Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution'', containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability, democracy and positive social change, was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/ |title=Liberating Voices Pattern Language |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deck "Group Works: A Pattern Language for Bringing Life to Meetings and Other Gatherings" was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groupworksdeck.org/ |title=Group Pattern Language Project |website=groupworksdeck.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, patterns were also introduced into [[systems architecture]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Adopting Patterns for Space Mission and Space Systems Architecting|url=https://www.academia.edu/2110976/A.M._Hein_Adopting_Patterns_for_Space_Mission_and._Space_Systems_Architecting_|work=5 th International Workshop on System &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space ApplicationsSECESA 2012|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Project Icarus: Stakeholder Scenarios for an Interstellar Exploration Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/1354848/PROJECT_ICARUS_STAKEHOLDER_SCENARIOS_FOR_AN_INTERSTELLAR_EXPLORATION_PROGRAM|work=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 64, 224-233, 2011|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cloutier|first=Robert|title=The Concept of Reference Architectures|url=http://www.calimar.com/TheConceptOfReferenceArchitectures.pdf|work=Systems Engineering Vol. 13, No. 1, 2010|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chess]] [[Chess strategy|strategy]] and [[Chess tactics|tactics]] involve many patterns from [[Chess opening|opening]] to [[checkmate]].

[[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[wiki]], coauthored a paper with [[Michael Mehaffy]] arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages, and that wikis "were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on [[Pattern Languages of Programs]], October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performative writing''' is a form of [[post-modernist]] or [[avant-garde]] academic writing, often taking as its subject a work of visual art or [[performance art]].  It is heavily informed by [[critical theory]], but arises ultimately from [[linguistics|linguistic]] ideas around [[performative utterance]]s. The term is often applied to a [[bricolage]] of other writing styles. It is claimed to be politically radical, because it thus 'defies' literary conventions and traditions.

It is often practiced by [[feminist]] writers. A notable current writer in performative writing is the performance art theorist Peggy Phelan.  She describes the form as one which....

:''"enacts the death of the 'we' that we think we are before we begin to write. A statement of allegiance to the radicality of unknowing who we are becoming, this writing pushes against the ideology of knowledge as a progressive movement forever approaching a completed end-point."'' (''Mourning Sex'', 1997)

Such a writing form is claimed to be, in itself, a form of performance. It is said to more accurately reflect the fleeting and ephemeral nature of a performance, and the various mechanisms of memory and [[referential]]ity that happen during and after the performance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Critics of performative writing have described it, in practice, as: self-indulgent; insular; politically neutred due to its tiny elite audience and its [[neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] [[individualism]]; [[obscurantist]]; often bearing only a loose relationship to the works of art it claims to be about; and dependent on the funding (of universities and public arts funding) of the very [[State (polity)|state]] that it claims to be against. Also that, when taught, it often paradoxically expects students to reveal personal truths and use experimental forms within a strict classroom regimen of grades, lesson attendance and exams. It can generally be seen to follow the pattern of much [[modernist]] writing, in that it seeks to create complex new literary approaches in order to seal off 'high art culture' from the attention of ordinary people and from a [[mass culture]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The term performative writing should not be confused with "writing that is performed", i.e.: [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[radio]] or [[poetry]] readings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Performative writing is sometimes referred to by the alternative name of 'creative critical writing'—which is not to be confused with straightforward [[creative writing]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Phonemic imagery''' refers to the processing of thoughts as words rather than as symbols or other images.  It is sometimes referred to as the equivalent of [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]]&lt;ref name=Velmans/&gt; or [[Imagined speech|covert speech]],{{cn|date=December 2013}} and sometimes considered as a third phenomenon, separate from but similar to these other forms of internal speech.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

Phonemic imagery is a part of the philosophy of [[consciousness]] rather than [[linguistics]] as it is considered an internal phenomenon of consciousness observed through [[Introspection|reflection]] rather than amenable to [[empirical]] observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13069">A '''recursive acronym''' is an [[acronym]] that [[recursion|refers to itself]]. The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning "GOD Over Djinn", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy – Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into "Eptification for Particular Task".

Recursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.

==Computer-related examples==
In [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context, from 1960 the [[backronym]] "Mash Until No Good" was created to describe Mung, and a while after it was revised to "Mung Until No Good".  It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1977 or 1978 came TINT ("TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson.  This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] ("EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name "GNU"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. "SPARKS" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but "several cute ideas have been suggested" as expansions of the name. One of the suggestions is "Smart Programmers Are Required to Know SPARKS".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals Of Data Structures (Ellis Horowitz &amp; [[Sartaj Sahni]], Computer Science Press, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; (this example is [[tail recursive]])

===Mutually recursive or otherwise special===
* The [[GNU Hurd]] project is named with a mutually recursive acronym: "Hurd" stands for "Hird of Unix-Replacing [[Daemon (computer software)|Daemon]]s", and "Hird" stands for "Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth."
* RPM, PHP, XBMC and YAML were originally conventional acronyms which were later redefined recursively. They are examples of, or may be referred to as, [[backronym]]ization,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010|reason=There's little evidence that this word exists outside of Wikipedia.}} where the official meaning of an acronym is changed.
* [[Jini]] claims the distinction of being the first recursive anti-acronym: 'Jini Is Not Initials'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artima.com/jini/faq.html#acronym ''FAQ for JINI-USERS Mailing List''], Retrieved 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Jini Specification,'' Arnold et al, Pearson, 1999, {{ISBN|0201616343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might, however, be more properly termed an anti-backronym because the term "Jini" never stood for anything in the first place. The more recent "[[Microsoft XNA|XNA]]", on the other hand, was deliberately designed that way.
* Most recursive acronyms are recursive on the first letter, which is therefore an arbitrary choice, often selected for reasons of humour, ease of pronunciation, or consistency with an earlier acronym that used the same letters for different words, such as PHP, which now stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", but was originally "Personal Home Page".  However [[Yopy|YOPY]], "Your own personal YOPY" is recursive on the last letter (hence the last letter of the acronym had to be the same as the first).

==In popular culture==
* TTP - a technology project in the ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strip. The initials stand for "The TTP Project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dilbert's TTP Project |url=http://dilbert.com/strip/1994-05-18 |website=Dilbert |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grunge|GRUNGE]] - defined by [[Homer Simpson]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[That '90s Show]]" as "Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energy", another uncommon example of a recursive acronym whose recursive letter is not the first letter.
* [[KOS-MOS]] - a character from the [[Xenosaga]] series of video games. "KOS-MOS" is a recursive acronym meaning "Kosmos Obey Strategical Multiple Operating Systems". It's unclear if it counts as a true recursive acronym, however, as the Kosmos referred to in the acronym may simply be an alternate spelling of [[cosmos]].

'''''Rövarspråket''''' ({{lang-en|The Robber Language}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[language game]]. It became popular after the books about [[Bill Bergson]] by [[Astrid Lindgren]], where the children use it as a [[code]], both at play and in solving actual crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=Lind51 |last=Lindgren |first=Astrid |authorlink=Astrid Lindgren |title=[[Bill Bergson Lives Dangerously]] (Mästerdetektiven Blomkvist lever farligt) |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for encoding is simple. Every consonant (spelling matters, not pronunciation) is doubled, and an ''o'' is inserted in-between. Vowels are left intact. It is quite possible to render the ''Rövarspråket'' version of an [[English language|English]] word as well as a [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''e.g.'':

:''sos-tot-u-bob-bob-o-ror-non'' or ''sostotubobboborornon''

that syllable chain would mean ''stubborn''. Needless to say, the code is not very useful in written form, but it can be tough when spoken by a trained (and thus quick) user. On the other hand, for an untrained speaker, a word or phrase can often be something of a [[tongue-twister]] or a [[shibboleth]].

Today, the books (and subsequent films) are so well known in Sweden, and also in Norway, that the language is part of the culture of schoolchildren. Most Scandinavians are familiar with it.

'''Sakshi''' or Sākṣī ([[Sanskrit]]: साक्षी) means – 'observer', 'eyewitness' or the 'Supreme Being' the one that lends its shine - " Chitchhaya"- to the "ego" part of the subtle body - which consists of the everchanging Mind, the decision making Intellect, the Memory &amp; the Illusory Ego ! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit – English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.6.apte.742017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], the word, ''Sākṣī'' or 'witness' refers to the 'Pure Awareness' that witnesses the world but does not get affected or involved. ''Sakshi'' is beyond time, space and the triad of experiencer, experiencing and experienced; ''sakshi'' witnesses all thoughts, words and deeds without interfering with them or being affected by them, other than ''sakshi'' there is nothing else in the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02ANh3NTm6sC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the word, साक्षी (''sākṣī''), used in the following verse from [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],

:एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः सर्वव्यापी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा |
:कर्माध्यक्षः सर्वभूताधिवासः साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च ||

:"The same Deity remains hidden in all beings, and is all-pervasive and the indwelling Self of all beings. He is the supervisor of actions, lives in all beings, (He is) the Witness, the bestower of intelligence, the Absolute and devoid of the (three) gunas." ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Sl. VI.11)
[[Pāṇini|Panini]] states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Śvetāśvatatra Upanisad 1986 Ed.|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=190–191|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/svetasvatara-upanishad-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakshi means [[Ishvara]], the चेता (cetā), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriya Yoga|author=Paramahamsa Hariharananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G11HR9B4io8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedanta]] speaks of mind (''chitta'') or ''antahkarana'' ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (''Chittakasha'') involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (''drg'') and the observed (''drshya''), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka|Drg-drshya-Viveka]]'' tells us:-

:"When form is the object of observation or drshyam, then the eye is the observer or drk; when the eye is the object of observation, then the mind is the observer; when the pulsations of the mind are the objects of observation, then Sakshi or the Witnessing-Self is the real observer; and it is always the observer, and, being self-luminous, can never be the object of observation. When the notion and the attachment that one is the physical body is dissolved, and the Supreme Self is realized, wherever one goes, there one experiences [[Samadhi]]. "

''Sakshi'', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the unchangeable eternal Reality, is the Pure Consciousness and knowledge, in which regard [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=86–87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJGFP__WXX0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oyExU7uCHs-GrAemvoCQBg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the senses (''indriyas'') are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Pschology: Its Meaning for the West|author=Swami Akhilananda|publisher=Routledge|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSVvzCC4mVYC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viIxU4rkNYLOrQfwzIAI&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the ''Bhumika'' ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of ''pranava'' (''Aum'' or ''[[Om]]'') as formed of or divided into – ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and ''ardhmātra'', which is on account of the difference of ''sthula'' ('gross'), ''sukshama'' ('subtle'), ''bija'' ('seed' or 'causal') and ''sakshi'' ('witness') whose ''avasthas'' ('states') are – 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. ''Sakshi'' which is '[[turiya]]' is the essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty which perceives the individual personality is ''Sakshi'' or 'Witness' or the higher 'Ego'. Mind (''manas''), Ego (''ahankara'') and ''Sakshi'', all perform different functions but that difference of functions does not mean difference in nature or essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rambles in Vedanta|author=B.R.Rajam Iyer|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=280, 289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89doofWiWJIC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iAxU9W8FIiFrAfQz4HQDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Philosophy discovered the concept of ''Sakshi'', the ultimate Observer, or Witness behind the sense of individuality, or the ego; the ''Sakshi'' is the timeless Being which witnesses all this ceaseless flow and change in the world of thought and things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manoniyantran|author=T.N.Achuta Rao|publisher=Gyan Books|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okUjWme6MF8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=sakshi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BB0xU-DbOI6FrgeLuYD4Dw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7705">'''Second language writing''' is the study of [[writing]] performed by non-native speakers/writers of a language as [[second language|a second]] or [[foreign language]].

In addition to disseminating research through the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]], scholars in the field regularly participate in three academic conferences, the Symposium on Second Language Writing,&lt;ref&gt;Grabe, William (2001). "Notes toward a theory of second language writing." In [[Paul Kei Matsuda|P.K. Matsuda]] &amp; T Silva (eds.) ''On second language writing'', 39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; the TESOL convention,&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, Alister (April 1987). "Decision making and text representation in ESL writing performance." Paper presented at the 21st Annual TESOL Convention, Miami.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Conference on College Composition and [[Communication]].&lt;ref name=Faber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faber|first1=Brenton|title=Rhetoric in Competition The Formation of Organizational Discourse in Conference on College Composition and Communication Abstracts|journal=Written Communication|date=July 1996|volume=13|issue=3|page=355-384|doi=10.1177/0741088396013003003|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/13/3/355.short|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symposium on Second Language Writing==
The Symposium on Second Language Writing, which began in 1998 at [[Purdue University]], is an international conference on second language writing. It was a biennial event through 2006, and annually after that.  It  has been hosted at Purdue University six times, but  the 2007 symposium was held in Japan; the 2009 at [[Arizona State University]], the 2010 in [[Murcia]], Spain; the 2011 in [[Taipei]], Taiwan; and the 2013 will be held at [[Shandong University]], [[Jinan]], China.&lt;ref&gt;Symposium on Second Language Writing. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://sslw.asu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Language Writing at TESOL, Inc.==
In June 2005, the TESOL Board added of a new interest section on writing. The '''Second Language Writing IS'''; it held its first meeting in [[Tampa]] in March 2006,  covering topics ranging from “Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing” and “Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers” to “Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms” and “Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.”

As these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and educators at different [[Educational stage|grade]] levels and institutional settings to discuss  second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are:

* to increase awareness of the significance of writing in teaching [[ESL]]/EFL,
* to encourage and support the teaching of writing to [[English for Speakers of Other Languages|ESOL]] students at all levels,
* to provide a forum to discuss issues of writing [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and the placement of second language writers, and
* to disseminate and promote research on second language writing  &lt;ref&gt;Second Language Writing Interest Section. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://secondlanguagewriting.com/slwis/&lt;/ref&gt;

The section facilitates communication about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field’s nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international [[K-12]] schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing.

Given this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body,  TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas.

==Second Language Writing at CCCC==
Second language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on College Composition and Communication|url=http://www.ncte.org/cccc|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing   to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field’s discussions.

Much recent attention focuses on the potential of [[Computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write.

In addition, attention has been focused on the practical application of teaching Second Language writing not only in academia but in the field. 

==Perspectives and theories==
Second language writing development has been investigated from many different perspectives. [[Rosa Manchón|Manchón]]'s edited book on ''L2 Writing Development: Multiple Perspectives'' provides an insight in which perspective second language writing development can be investigated. Her edited books includes studies on L2 writing development from [[Dynamic approach to second language development|Dynamic Systems Theory]], [[Goal Theory]], Genre-based [[Systemic functional linguistics]], and Rhetorical genre theory.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/44165&lt;/ref&gt;

Second language writing development has been most extensively investigated by traditional [[cross-sectional]] methodologies such as pre-test post-test designs.

However, in the early 2000s a novel angle has emerged called [[Dynamical systems theory]] approach on [[Second language development]]. Studies adopting the DST perspective explore interactions between different constructs such as lexicon, syntax, and accuracy by using moving correlations. The degree of variability in the constructs is usually explored by min-max graphs, data resampling and Monte Carlo Analysis. Among the researchers who have adopted this new angle are [[Marjolijn Verspoor|Verspoor]], [[Cornelis de Bot|de Bot]], and [[Wander Lowie|Lowie]]. These researchers used a [[time-series]] data to investiagte development in second language writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/dynamic-systems-theory-and-variation-a-case-study-in-l2writing(fe120ba4-defa-4577-b34b-daf6ff7fbb76).html|title=Dynamic systems theory and variation: a case study in L2-writing|date=2004|publisher=Amsterdam: Free University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''speech-to-text reporter''' ('''STTR'''), also known as a '''captioner''', is a person who listens to what is being said and inputs it, word for word ([[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]]), using an electronic shorthand keyboard or speech recognition software and a CAT software system. Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captions.org/2006/02/captioning-students-thoughts.html |title=Closed Captioning Web |publisher=Captions.org |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people.

The latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers.  Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or '''voice''' silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and '''voice'''-dampening materials.  A voice writing system consists of a [[stenomask]], an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.

A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.

Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and "inner" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from "inner voice" to the physiological "spoken voice." Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.

Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.

Other ways of producing speech-to-text:  There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the [[Stenograph]] system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as '''palantypists''' and '''stenographers'''. Unlike a [[QWERTY]] keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed [[computer software]] will then convert these [[Phonetics|phonetic]] chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read.

The computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses.  Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next.

The [[professional association]] for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.  The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.

== What will a service user see on the screen? ==
Every word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words "NEW SPEAKER:" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking.  Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events.

Occasional [[mondegreen]] errors may be seen in closed-captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream.  For example, a news report of a "grand parade" might be captioned as a "grandpa raid". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.

== History ==
Many STTRs began their careers as [[court reporter]]s. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.

== Training==
In order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

If becoming a [[Voice writer|voice writing STTR]], the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous.  Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

Only then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification.  In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training.

There are many levels of certification.  NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners.  Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field.

The NVRA certification testing program is available to all members.  Tests are held at regular intervals throughout the year in various locations across the country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvra.org/nvra-certifications|title=NVRA certifications|website=nvra.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Unitised CACDP Examinations and membership with the CACDP Register, confirms that one has reached the required minimum standard.  The majority of Registered STTRs are also Members of the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">In [[linguistics]], '''transformational syntax''' is a derivational approach to [[syntax]] that developed from the extended standard theory of [[generative grammar]] originally proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his books ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' and ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]''.&lt;ref name="Akmajian"&gt;Akmajian, Adrian; Heny, Frank ''An Introduction To The Principles Of Transformational Syntax'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262510226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged from a need to improve on approaches to [[grammar]] in [[structural linguistics]]. 

Particularly in early incarnations, transformational syntax adopted the view that [[phrase structure grammar]] must be enriched by a transformational grammar, with [[syntactic rules]] or [[syntactic operations]] that alter the base structures created by phrase structure rules. In more recent theories, including [[Government and Binding Theory]] but especially in [[Minimalist program|Minimalism]], the strong distinction between phrase structure and transformational components has largely been abandoned, with operations that build structure ([[phrase structure rules]]) and those that change structure ([[transformational rules]]) either interleaved, or unified under a single operation (as in the Minimalist operation [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]]). 

==Overview==
{{Main|Transformational grammar}}
According to the Chomskyan tradition, [[language acquisition]] is easy for children because they are born with a [[universal grammar]] in their minds. The tradition also distinguishes between [[linguistic competence]], what a person knows of a language, and [[linguistic performance]], how a person uses it. Finally, grammars and metagrammars are ranked by three [[levels of adequacy]]: observational, descriptive, and explanatory. A core aspect of the original Standard Theory is a distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called [[deep structure]] and [[surface structure]]. The two representations are linked to each other by a set of transformation rules, the totality of these rules is what constitute grammar, and what a grammatical description of a language should present. Under this theory, a speaker must have access to both structures to interpret an expression.

Under this model, syntax was placed in the center of linguistic research and sought to go beyond description. Scholars explored the formalism of syntax and psychology of grammar under this model. This led to more systematic research on linguistic data such as [[native speaker]] judgments and distinctions in [[grammaticality]].

Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including [[Andrew Radford (linguist)|Andrew Radford]],&lt;ref name="radford"&gt;Radford, Andrew (1982). ''Transformational Syntax: A Student's Guide to Chomsky's Extended Standard Theory'' Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521285742}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodney Huddleston]],&lt;ref name="huddleston"&gt;Huddleston, Rodney D.

===Non-transformational syntax===

Non-transformational syntax describes competing models. The main non-transformational syntactic frameworks include [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical-functional grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[simpler syntax]].&lt;ref name="borsley"&gt;Borsley, Robert; Börjars, Kersti, eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="915">In [[philosophy]], to say that a statement is '''truth-apt''' is to say that it could be uttered in some context (without its meaning being altered) and would then express a [[Truth|true]] or false proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Blackburn.

The principle of '''truth-value links''' is a concept in [[metaphysics]] discussed in debates between [[philosophical realism]] and [[anti-realism]]. Philosophers who appeal to truth-value links in order to explain how individuals can come to understand parts of the world that are apparently cognitively inaccessible (the past, the feelings of others, etc.) are called truth-value link realists.

== Truth-value link realism&lt;!--'Truth-value link realism' and 'Evidence-transcendent' redirects here--&gt; ==

[[Image:TVL.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|The principle of ''truth-value links'' depicted graphically.]]

Proponents of '''truth-value link realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; argue that our understanding of past-tense statements allows us to grasp the truth-conditions of the statements, even if they are '''evidence-transcendent'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. They explain this by noting that it is unproblematic for us to conceptualize a present-tense true statement being true in the future. In other words, if "It is raining today" is true today, then "It was raining yesterday" will be true tomorrow. Truth-value link realists argue that this same construction can be applied to past-tense statements. For example, "It was raining yesterday" is true today if and only if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday.

The truth-value link allows us to understand the following. First, suppose that we can understand, in an unproblematic way, truth about a present-tense statement. Assume that it is true, now, when one claims "On 22 May 2006, Student X is writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement A. Suppose that, a year later, someone claims, "On 22 May 2006, Student X was writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement B. According to [[Michael Dummett]]’s explication of the truth-value link, "since the statement A is now true, the statement B, made in one year’s time, is likewise true."&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael, "The Reality of the Past," in ''Truth and Other Enigmas'' (Harvard University Press, 1978), 363.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in understanding the truth-value link that one is able to understand what it is for a statement in the past-tense to be true. The truth-value persists in the tense shift – hence the "link."

=== Criticisms ===

Some philosophers, including [[Michael Dummett]] and [[John McDowell]], have criticized truth-value link realism. They argue that it is unintelligible to suppose that training in a language can give someone ''more'' than what is involved in the training, i.e. access to inaccessible realms like the past and the minds of others. More important, they suggest that the realist appeal to the principle of truth-value links does not actually explain how the inaccessible can be cognized. When the truth-value link realist claims that, if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday, then "It was raining yesterday" ''is'' true today, he or she is still appealing to an inaccessible realm of the past. In brief, one is attempting to access that which one has already conceded as being inaccessible.

'''The Valuev Circular''' ({{lang-ru|Валуевский циркуляр, Valuyevskiy tsirkulyar}}; {{lang-uk|Валуєвський циркуляр, Valuievs'kyi tsyrkuliar}}) of 18 July 1863 was a secret [[decree]] ([[Ukase|ukaz]]) of the [[List of Ministers of Interior of Imperial Russia|Minister of Internal Affairs]] of the [[Russian Empire]] [[Pyotr Valuev]] (Valuyev) by which a large portion of the publications (religious, and literature used for school training) in the [[Ukrainian language]] was forbidden.

The Circular has put the reason for the growing number of textbooks in Ukrainian, and beginner-level books in Ukrainian with "the Poles' political interests" and the "separatist intentions of some of the Little Russians". The Circular also stated that "a separate [[Little Russian]] language never existed, doesn't exist, and couldn't exist", and that the commoners' tongue in Little Russia is nothing but Russian corrupted by [[Polish language|Polish]] influence.

The Circular ordered the Censorship Committees to ban the publication of religious texts, educational texts, and beginner-level books in Ukrainian, but permitted publication of ''[[belles-lettres]]'' works in that language.

Further restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian language by the [[Ems Ukaz]] in 1876, which completely prohibited the usage of the language in open print.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21015">{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Variation''' is a characteristic of language: there is more than one way of saying the same thing. Speakers may vary pronunciation ([[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), word choice ([[lexicon]]), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called "[[grammar]]").&lt;ref name="Meecham2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=Meecham|first1=Marjory|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=0-312-24738-9|editor1-last=O'Grady|editor1-first=William|edition=Fourth|chapter=Language in social contexts|editor2-last=Archibald|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Aronoff|editor3-first=Mark|editor4-last=Rees-Miller|editor4-first=Janie}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation – speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-3559-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native tongue.

Variationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs.  Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preston|first=Dennis R.|date=1993-06-01|title=Variation linguistics and SLA|journal=Second Language Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=153–172|doi=10.1177/026765839300900205|issn=0267-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Language variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the ''social'' characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding ''linguistic'' context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures.

Studies of language variation and its correlation with [[Sociology|sociological]] categories, such as [[William Labov]]'s 1963 paper "The social motivation of a sound change," led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labov |first=William |title=The social motivation of a sound change |doi=10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799|journal=Word |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=273–309 |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chambers |first=J.K. |title=Sociolinguistic Theory: Linguistic Variation and its Social Significance |publisher=Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-631-22882-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.

== Sociolinguistic variables ==
Studies in the field of [[sociolinguistics]] typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to
* be high in frequency,
* have a certain immunity from conscious suppression,
* be an integral part of larger structures, and
* be easily quantified on a linear scale.&lt;ref name="Labov662"&gt;Labov, William (1966), ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City'', Diss. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phonetics|Phonetic]] variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, [[morphophonological]] variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the [[glottal stop]], the height or backness of a [[vowel]] or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a [[double negative]]). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in "I kep' walking" (Wolfram 1969;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt. 1969. ''A Sociolinguistic Description of Detroit Negro Speech''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov et al. 1968&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William, Cohen, Paul, Robins, Clarence, &amp; Lewis, John. 1968. ''A Study of the Non-standard English of Negro and Puerto Rican Speakers in New York City''. Co-operative Research Report 3288, Vol. 1. Philadelphia: U.S. Regional Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;); and the [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#G-dropping|ING variable]], the optional pronunciation of ''-ing'' at the end of a word as ''-in''', as in "I kept walkin'" (e.g. Fisher 1958;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00437956.1958.11659655|pages=47–56|title=Social Influences on the Choice of a Linguistic Variant|journal=''word''|volume=14|year=2015|last1=Fischer|first1=John L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labov 1966/1982;&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966 [1982]. ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill 1974&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter. 1974. ''The social differentiation of English in Norwich''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Analysis and methodology ==
Analyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant ''could have'' occurred. This is called the "Principle of Accountability" in [[Sali Tagliamonte|Tagliamonte]] (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results.&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012&gt;Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). ''Variationist Sociolinguistics: Change, observation, interpretation''. UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–21}} This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns ''that'', ''who'', and zero).&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012 /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

== Association with age ==
There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.

One example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth.  Just as street youth dress differently from the "norm", they also often have their own "language".  The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. [[Age-graded variation]] is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies.&lt;ref name="Chambers2"&gt;Chambers, J.K. (1995). ''Sociolinguistic Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt; to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'.&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt;

People tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. [[William Bright]] provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'.&lt;ref name="Bright19972"&gt;Bright, William (1997). "Social Factors in Language Change." In Coulmas, Florian (ed) ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania. circa 2005. ''Phonological atlas of North America'', [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1.html Map 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the [[apparent-time hypothesis]] where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.

== Association with geography ==
{{Main|Dialectology}}
A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. [[Dialectology]] studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

== Association with gender ==
{{Main|Language and gender}}
Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).

The initial identification of a ''women's register'' was by [[Robin Lakoff]] in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society ("female deficit approach").&lt;ref name="Lakoff2"&gt;Lakoff, R.  (1975).  ''Language and Women’s Place''.  New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference ("dominance theory").&lt;ref name="OBarr2"&gt;O’Barr, William and Bowman Atkins. (1980) "'Women’s Language' or 'powerless language'?" In McConnell-Ginet et al. (eds) ''Women and languages in Literature and Society.'' pp. 93-110. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior.

More recently, [[Deborah Tannen]] has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences ("cultural difference approach"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a ''[[report]]'' style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a ''[[rapport]]'' style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen912"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. (1991). ''You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.'' London: Virago.&lt;/ref&gt;

People tend to [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00329|pages=171–175|title=Where is the Gender in Gendered Language?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=2|year=2016|last1=Thomson|first1=Rob|last2=Murachver|first2=Tamar|last3=Green|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''African American English (AAE)'''''

Communities of African Americans and Whites have been popular{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fix|first1=Sonya|date=2014|title=AAE as a bounded ethnolinguistic resource for white women with African American ties|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=35|pages=55–74|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2013.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=how does it help inform?|date=December 2017}} Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} step in understanding the origins of AAE.&lt;ref name=":1222"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of African American Language|last=Lanehart|first=Sonja|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-979539-0|location=New York|pages=1–895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American English]] and [[Southern American English|Southern White American English]] both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776).&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including [[Robbins Burling]], [[Ralph Fasold]], [[Joey Dillard]], [[William Labov]], Williams Stewart, [[Geneva Smitherman]], and [[Walt Wolfram]] to name a few.&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. There have been many different perspectives{{Vague|date=December 2017}} to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shollenbarger|first=Amy|date=2017|title=How African American English-Speaking First Graders Segment and Rhyme Words and Nonwords With Final Consonant Clusters|doi=10.1044/2017_LSHSS-16-0062|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|volume=48|issue=4|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asian English'''''

Very little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Wolfram, W., &amp; Schilling-Estes, N. (2005). American English: Dialects and variation. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Fought, Carmen. (2006). Language and Ethnicity. Cambridge,. UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the “[[model minority]]”,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kim, P. S., &amp; Lewis, G.B. 1994. “Asian-Americans in the Public-Service: Success, Diversity, and Discrimination.” Public Administration Review 54 (3): 285–90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term “Asian Americans” cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which “the dominant ideology treats as a single entity".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization.

'''Verbosity''' or '''verboseness''' is speech or writing that uses more words than necessary (for example, using "Despite the fact that" instead of "Although").&lt;ref name="communitycollege" /&gt; The opposite of verbosity is [[plain language]].
Some teachers, including the author of ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including [[Mark Twain]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], are known for their avoidance of verbosity. 

Synonyms for verbosity include '''wordiness''', '''verbiage''', '''prolixity''', '''grandiloquence''', '''garrulousness''', '''expatiation''', '''logorrhea''', and '''sesquipedalianism'''. 

Examples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.

==Etymology and synonyms==
The word ''verbosity'' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''verbosus'', "wordy". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.

''Prolixity'' comes from Latin ''prolixus'', "extended". ''Prolixity'' can also be used to refer to the length of a [[monologue]] or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's [[oral argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Percy Anecdotes |last=Percy |first=Sholto |authorlink= Joseph Clinton Robertson |author2=Reuben Percy  |year=1826 |publisher=T. Boys |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJEAAAAIAAJ |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grandiloquence'' is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic [[diction]]. It is a combination of the Latin words ''grandis'' ("great") and ''loqui'' ("to speak").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grandiloquence |title=Dictionary.com - Grandiloquence |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logorrhea'' or ''logorrhoea'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] λογόρροια, ''logorrhoia'', "[[word]]-[[flux]]") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''Sesquipedalianism'' is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet [[Horace]] coined the phrase ''sesquipedalia verba'' in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0064%3Acard%3D73 |title=Ars Poetica, l.97 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''sesqui'', "one and a half", and ''pes'', "[[Foot (prosody)|foot]]", a reference to [[Meter (poetry)|meter]]. The earliest recorded usage in English of ''sesquipedalian'' is in 1656, and of ''sesquipedalianism'', 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Simpson |first =J. A. |last2=Weiner |first2=E. S. C. |title=The Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Garrulous'' comes from Latin ''garrulus'', "talkative", a form of the verb ''garrīre'', "to chatter". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/garrulous |title=Dictionary.com - Garrulous |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''expatiation'' and the verb ''expatiate'' come from Latin ''expatiātus'', past participle from ''spatiārī'', "to wander". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expatiation |title=Dictionary.com - expatiation |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific jargon==
The word ''logorrhea'' is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe highly [[figurative language|abstract]] prose that contains little [[Literal and figurative language|concrete language]]. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as [[philosophy]], often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.
 
In an attempt to prove that "logorrhea" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (''[[Social Text]]'') as a [[practical joke]]. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the [[Sokal Affair]].&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ The Sokal Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as ''prolixity''. Some people defend the use of additional words as [[idiom]]atic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Examples==
[[Warren G. Harding]], the 29th [[President of the United States]], was notably verbose even in his era. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A Democratic leader, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], described Harding's speeches as "an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding|title=Warren G. Harding|publisher=The White House|accessdate=2013-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726020027/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding|archive-date=2012-07-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert C. Byrd]] (Democrat, of [[West Virginia]]) lost his position as [[Majority Leader]] in 1989 because his colleagues felt his speeches, which often employed obscure [[allusion]]s to [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], were not an asset to the [[Party politics|party base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-22-byrd-fight-GOP_x.htm |title=At 87, Byrd Faces Re-election Battle of His Career |date=2005-05-22|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled "Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Dennis W.|title=Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional "Meaning" for the Uninitiated|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=December 1997|volume=96|issue=3|pages=461–690|jstor=1290146|doi=10.2307/1290146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The King's English]]'', Fowler gives a passage from ''[[The Times]]'' as an example of verbosity: "''The Emperor'' received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck.... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in ''His Majesty's'' mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when ''the Monarch'' goes again to Budapest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Henry Watson|last2=Fowler|first2=Francis George|title=The King's English|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler objected to this passage because ''The Emperor'', ''His Majesty'', and ''the Monarch'' all refer to the same person: "the effect", he pointed out in ''Modern English Usage'', "is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none."

==Style advice==
{{POV-section|talk=POV Issues|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--Can ''noone'' be found to defend it?--&gt;
While verbosity may be rhetorically useful&lt;ref name="communitycollege"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roanestate.edu/owl/clutter.html |title=Removing Word Clutter |work=Roane State}}&lt;/ref&gt; verbose parts in communications are sometimes referred to as "fluff" or "fuzz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Simplicity |title=On writing well: An informal guide to writing nonfiction |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row|author=[[William Zinsser]] |url=http://cgiss.boisestate.edu/~billc/Writing/zinsser.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Callimachus]] is quoted as saying "Big book, big evil" (μέγα βιβλίον μέγα κακόν, ''mega biblion, mega kakon''), rejecting the [[Epic poetry|epic]] style of [[poetry]] in favor of his own.

[[William Strunk]], an American professor of English advised in 1918 to "Use the active voice: Put statements in positive form; Omit needless words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|year=1918|publisher=Feedbooks|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) [[Henry Watson Fowler]] says, "It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, &amp; still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of [[elegant variation]]," Fowler's term for the over-use of [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Henry Watson|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|year=1994|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1-85326-318-7|origyear=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English [[prose]], in some other languages, including [[French language|French]], it might be thought to be a good writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Translation And Creativity: Perspectives on Creative Writing And Translation Studies |chapter=Painting with words |editor=Eugenia Loffredo, Manuela Perteghella |first=Ann |last=Paterson |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8793-9 |page=88 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|quote=. . . the rule of ''elegant variation'' (that is, using synonyms wherever possible), which purists consider to be essential for good style in French.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Translator's Handbook: (with special reference to conference translation from French and Spanish) |first=Frederick |last=Fuller |year=1984 |isbn=0-271-00368-5 |page=35 |publisher=[[Penn State University Press]] |quote=''Elegant variation'' French tends to avoid repetition of proper names, with a description of the person, at second reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]] (1835&amp;ndash;1910) wrote "generally, the fewer the words that fully communicate or evoke the intended ideas and feelings, the more effective the communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |title=Reference for Prolixity |publisher=Search.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025741/http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), the 1954 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] for literature, defended his concise style against a charge by [[William Faulkner]] that he "had never been known to use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Rovit|first1=Earl|last2=Waldhorn|first2=Arthur|title=Hemingway and Faulkner in Their Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zRLAq6eBS4C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=28 February 2011|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1825-8|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway responded by saying, "Poor [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shapiro| first= Fred R.|title= The Yale Book of Quotations| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA354 |accessdate= 28 February 2011| year= 2006 |publisher= Yale University Press| isbn=0-300-10798-6|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry into the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]] found that verbosity can be dangerous if used by emergency services. It can lead to delay that could cost lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8374581/77-inquests-emergency-services-should-use-plain-English.html |title=7/7 inquests: emergency services should use plain English|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study from the [[psychology]] department of [[Princeton University]] found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors. But those who used long words or complex [[font]] types were seen as less intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Daniel M.|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/psy3001/files/simple%20writing.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|title=Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with using long words needlessly|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|pages=139–15|doi=10.1002/acp.1178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', one of [[Polonius]]'s many [[sententiae|sententious]] maxims reads {{quote|Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,&lt;br&gt;And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,&lt;br&gt;I will be brief.}}
Shakespeare's audiences were not necessarily inclined to read Polonius as someone who is perfectly wise; his sentences, like that of much early modern drama, can easily be seen as part of a comic trope.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[George Orwell]] mocked logorrhea in "[[Politics and the English Language]]" (1946) by taking verse (9:11) from the book of [[Ecclesiastes]] in the [[Bible]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and rewriting it as

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quantum physicist [[Richard Feynman]] has also spoken out against verbosity in scientific writing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=Nov 1, 1992 |title=Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman |publisher=Vintage Random House |page=9 |isbn= |accessdate=Jan 5, 2015 |quote='his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=My friend Richard Feynman |first=Leonard

'''Writer's block''' is a condition, primarily associated with [[writing]], in which an author loses the ability to produce new work, or experiences a creative slowdown. The condition ranges in difficulty from coming up with original ideas to being unable to produce a work for years. Throughout history, writer's block has been a documented problem.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Irene. "Invention." Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing. 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Typewriter Adler No. 7 (5).jpg|thumb]]
Professionals who have struggled with the affliction include authors such as [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi, Greg. "Great Scott: Fitzgerald's Baltimore." The JHU Gazette. Johns Hopkins University. 28. September 2009. Web. 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32602862 The ''New Yorker'' writer who didn't publish for 30 years ''BBC News'' feature and video 7 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; comic strip cartoonist [[Charles M. Schulz]],&lt;ref name=Downey&gt;Downey, Bill. Right Brain – Write ON!. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc. 1984. Print&lt;/ref&gt; composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-10766308 How great artists have fought creative block]&lt;/ref&gt; and songwriter [[Adele]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shows.huffingtonpost.com/video/saturday-s-showbiz-news-adele-opens-up-about-writer-s-block-519185000?context=PC:homepage:PL6394:1445588705245 Adele Opens Up About Writer's Block]&lt;/ref&gt; Research concerning this topic was done in the late 1970s and 1980s. During this time, researchers were influenced by the Process and Post-Process movements, and therefore focused specifically on the writer's processes. The condition was first described in 1947 by psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]].&lt;ref name="Akhtar2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Akhtar|first=Salman|title=Comprehensive dictionary of psychoanalysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35HoGo2uF1kC&amp;pg=PA310|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-85575-860-5|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some great writers may have already suffered from writer’s block years before Bergler described it, such as [[Herman Melville]], who quit writing novels a few years after writing ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John J. “Wordsmiths Without Words.” National Review 68.9 (2016): 23-24. Academic Search Premier. Web. 20 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Writer's block may have several causes. Some are [[Creativity|creative]] problems that originate within an author's work itself. A writer may run out of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]], or be distracted by other events. A fictional example can be found in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'', in which the protagonist Gordon Comstock struggles in vain to complete an [[epic poem]] describing a day in London: "It was too big for him, that was the truth. It had never really progressed, it had simply fallen apart into a series of fragments."&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''Keep The Aspidistra Flying'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other blocks may be produced by adverse circumstances in a writer's life or career: physical illness, depression, the end of a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]], financial pressures, or a sense of failure.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The pressure to produce work may in itself contribute to writer's block, especially if they are compelled to work in ways that are against their natural inclination (i.e. with a deadline or an unsuitable style or genre). Writer's block may also come from feeling intimidated by one's previous big successes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The writer [[Elizabeth Gilbert]], reflecting on her post-bestseller prospects, proposed that such a pressure might be released by interpreting creative writers as "having" genius rather than "being" a genius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html Elizabeth Gilbert on nurturing creativity], a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk in 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that writer's block is more than just a mentality. Under stress, a human brain will  "shift control from the [[cerebral cortex]] to the [[limbic system]]".&lt;ref name="writer's brain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quitwork.club/The-Writers-Brain-Rosanne-Bane41-50_1.pdf|title=The Writer's Brain|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limbic system is associated with the instinctual processes, such as "fight or flight" response; and behavior that is based on "deeply engrained training". The limited input from the cerebral cortex hinders a person's creative processes, which are replaced by the behaviors associated with the limbic system. The person is often unaware of the change, which may lead them to believe they are creatively "blocked".&lt;ref name="writer's brain"/&gt; In her 2004 book ''The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain'' ({{ISBN|9780618230655}}), the writer and [[neurology|neurologist]] [[Alice Weaver Flaherty|Alice W. Flaherty]] has argued that literary creativity is a function of specific [[List of regions in the human brain|areas of the brain]], and that block may be the result of brain activity being disrupted in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/06/14/040614fa_fact|first=Joan|last=Acolella|title=Blocked: why do writers stop writing?|work=The New Yorker|date=14 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a composition perspective, Lawrence Oliver says, in his article, "Helping Students Overcome Writer's Block", "Students receive little or no advice on how to generate ideas or explore their thoughts, and they usually must proceed through the writing process without guidance or corrective feedback from the teacher, who withholds comments and criticism until grading the final product."&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;Oliver Jr., Lawrence J. "Helping Students Overcome Writer's Block." Journal of Reading. 26.2 (1982): 162–168. JSTOR. Online. 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He says, students "learn to write by writing", and often they are insecure and/or paralyzed by rules.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt;

Phyllis Koestenbaum wrote in her article "The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing" about her trepidation toward writing, claiming it was tied directly to her instructor's response.&lt;ref name=Koestenbaum&gt;Koestenbaum, Phyllis. "The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing." The Massachusetts Review. Vol. issue (Year): 278–308. Web. 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She says, "I needed to write to feel, but without feeling I couldn't write."&lt;ref name=Koestenbaum /&gt; To contrast Koestenbaum experience, Nancy Sommers expressed her belief that papers do not end when students finish writing and that neither should instructors' comments.&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;Somers, Nancy. "Across the Drafts." Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in Teaching of Writing. 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She urges a "partnership" between writers and instructors so that responses become a conversation.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

James Adams notes in his book, ''Conceptual Blockbusting'', various reasons blocks occur include fear of taking a risk, "chaos" in the pre-writing stage, judging versus generating ideas, an inability to incubate ideas, or a lack of motivation.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, James. Conceptual Blockbusting. Cambridge: Perseus Publishing. 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
As far as strategies for coping with writer's block Clark describes: class and group discussion, journals, free writing and [[brainstorming]], clustering, list making, and engaging with the text.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; To overcome writing blocks, Oliver suggests asking writers questions to uncover their writing process.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt; Then he recommends solutions such as systematic questioning, freewriting, and encouragement.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt; A recent study of 2500 writers aimed to find techniques that writers themselves use to overcome writer's block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopprocrastinatingapp.com/writers-block|title=Study to discover strategies to overcome writer's block|website=www.stopprocrastinatingapp.com/writers-block|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research discovered a range of solutions from altering the time of day to write and setting deadlines to lowering expectations and using mindfulness meditation. 

Garbriele Lusser Rico's concern with the mind links to [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]], also explored by Rose and Linda Flowers and John R. Hayes among others. Rico's book, ''Writing the Natural Way'' looks into invention strategies, such as clustering, which has been noted to be an invention strategy used to help writers overcome their blocks,&lt;ref name=Rico&gt;Rico, Gabriele Lusser. ''Writing the Natural Way''. Boston: J. P. Teacher, Inc., 1983. Print&lt;/ref&gt; and further emphasizes the solutions presented in works by Rose, Oliver, and Clark. Similar to Rico, James Adams discusses right brain involvement in writing.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt; While Downey purposes that he is basing his approach in practical concerns,&lt;ref name="Downey"/&gt; his concentration on right brain techniques speaks to cognitive theory approach similar to Rico's and a more practical advice for writers to approach their writer's block.&lt;ref name=Downey /&gt;

'''ǂKxʼao-ǁʼae'''{{pronunciation?}} (ǂKxʼauǁʼein{{pronunciation?}}, Auen, Kaukau) is a southeastern variety of the [[ǃKung language|!Xuun]] [[dialect continuum]], spoken in [[Botswana]] (the settlements of [[Groote Laagte]], [[East Hanahai]], Kanagas and [[Ghanzi]] in [[Ghanzi District]] and on the commercial farms) and in [[Namibia]] (the city of [[Gobabis]] and settlements along the C22 road to [[Otjinene]] as far as [[Eiseb]], [[Omaheke Region]]) by about 7,000 people. In Botswana, most speakers are bilingual in [[Naro language|Naro]] or [[Tswana language|Tswana]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

There are numerous spellings of the name, including ''ǁAuǁei, ǁX’auǁ’e,'' and ''Auen''. Endonyms are ''Juǀʼhoan, ǃXuun ''in Namibia and ''ǂKx'ao||'ae'' (predominantly in Botswana) meaning "northern people" in Naro. It also goes by the names ''Gobabis ǃKung'' and ''Kaukau ''(which can take the noun class prefixes in [[Tswana language|Tswana]] to give ''Mokaukau ''for one person, ''Bakaukau'' for the group and ''Sekaukau'' for the language).

In Namibia, ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''tends to refer literally to the !Xuun speakers to the north in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi area]]. With the exception of a few cultural traits, speakers of ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''in Botswana and those of Ju|'hoan in Namibia argue that they are one and the same people, speaking one language, with some dialectal attributes.

The non-Latin characters used by the language predominantly refer to [[click consonants]] and follow the orthography by Patrick Dickens for [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀ'hoan]].

The limited data on these dialects is poorly transcribed, but as of 2015 fieldwork is in progress.
