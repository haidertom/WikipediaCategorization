'''''!Women Art Revolution''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]] and distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]]. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists, curators, critics, and historians.

==Synopsis==
''!Women Art Revolution'' is a documentary film, created by [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], to examine the under-recognized world of [[feminist art]]. Through interviews, documentary footage, and artworks, the film tracks the trajectory of feminist art. It begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests, it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s.

Lynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result.The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists, very few can name more than [[Frida Kahlo|Frida Khalo]]. Hershman calls the film the, "remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told." She says the events of the day led her to feel an, "urgency to capture that moment" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera.

The film gets its name from the [[Women Artists in Revolution]] (WAR), which formed in the 1960's as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time.

The film overlays historical events with feminist art events, which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the [[Vietnam War]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation]], and [[Free Speech Movement]]. She labels the [[Miss America 1968|1968 Miss America Pageant]] as the moment when art and politics fused, culminating in a weeklong protest of art events.

The film mentions that [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimalism]] was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics, this movement didn't match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues, creating a platform for awareness of these events.

==Release==
The film debuted at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knegt|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''!Women Art Revolution'' played at New York's [[IFC Center]] beginning June 1, 2011, before opening around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yerman|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voynar|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Archive==
In the film, Hershman states that the filming process, "has accumulated (roughly) 12,428 minutes of footage," and ''!W.A.R.'' shows only 83 minutes, leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson's interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the [[Stanford University Libraries]] collection, ''!W.A.R. Voices of a Movement''.&lt;ref name =a8/&gt; According to the collection website, Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to "be shared with as wide an audience as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Barry Keith Grant]] praises the film in his Film International piece, "Leeson's film is a like a patchwork quilt of disparate footage, but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Ellen Druda says, "This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman's heart. Not only art lovers will come away with a deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Druda|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Knight for the Windy City Times has a more critical view of the film, explaining, "Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own - just like those 'womyn only' coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day.' So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries - and annoyingly overlooks the artists feminist forebears (like O'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) - !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elisabeth Subrin states that "Fusing history with memoir, Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Subrin|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Stephen Holden, in his review of the ''Cotton Club Parade'' in 2011 for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "The revue’s solution to the debatable issue of caricature and at what point a broad performance becomes a demeaning minstrel-show parody is to rein in the extremes. But it is in no way sedate. If the show has no Nell Carter or Ruth Brown, it does have Adriane Lenox, who delivers the Sippie Wallace advice song 'Women Be Wise'... with a knowing tang.... Mr. Carlyle’s clean choreography connects variations of the Charleston with jitterbugging and a little break-dancing to suggest the continuity of styles without insisting on it."&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen.

Elysa Gardner in her review for ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: "...you get 90 minutes of honest, vital entertainment, delivered with enough breezy wit to mitigate the flashes of pomp."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Elysa.

Linda Winer, in her review for ''Newsday'', noted that the most important part of the revue is the band. She wrote: "When that push for slickness goes into overdrive, the ensemble can feel ragged.... Adriane Lenox is marvelous in such sardonic, been-around revelations as 'Go Back Where You Stayed Last Night.' The dancers, led by former Twyla Tharp star Karine Plantadit, are strong."&lt;ref&gt;Winer, Linda.

'''William James Mitchell Jr.''' (born July 17, 1965) is an American [[restaurateur]], businessman, and former [[competitive gamer]]. He initially rose to fame in the 1980s when ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine included him in a photo spread of video game champions during the height of the [[golden age of arcade video games|golden age]] of [[Arcade game#Arcade video games|arcade video games]]. Though once recognized as the holder of several notable records on classic games, a 2018 investigation found several of Mitchell's scores to be [[fraudulent]], having been obtained [[cheating|dishonestly]]. As a result, his scores were stricken from [[Twin Galaxies]]'s rolls and ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', and he was banned from submitting any future scores.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/king-of-kong-stripped-of-title-1202751358/?replytocom=5818759#respond|title=‘King of Kong’ Star Stripped of High Scores, Banned From Competition|first=Brian|last=Crecente|date=April 12, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell maintained a fan base throughout his public life as a leader in retro gaming, with David Ramsey, writing for the ''[[Oxford American]]'' in 2006, referring to Mitchell as "probably the greatest arcade video game player of all time."&lt;ref name="oxford_american"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/622-the-perfect-man|title=The Perfect Man|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's signature achievement was a claim to have earned the first [[Pac-Man#Perfect play|perfect score]] of 3,333,360 points on the original ''[[Pac-Man]]'' arcade game on July 4, 1999, which stood as the original record until April 2018, when it was stricken from the record along with his other scores.

Throughout the early 2000s and 2010s, Mitchell was a frequently sought-after interview subject for documentaries on the worlds of competitive gaming and [[retro gaming]], including ''[[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]]'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chasing Ghosts on IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479879/|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The King of Arcades]]'' (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The King of Arcades on IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395228/|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Man vs Snake|Man vs Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man vs Snake|url=https://manvssnake.com/|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAN vs SNAKE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL6Qdem_kKg|publisher=Mr. Mitchell appears at 1:11 in the trailer.|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Mitchell was a subject of the 2007 documentary ''[[The King of Kong|The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'' (2007),&lt;ref name="oxford_american" /&gt; which follows his attempts to maintain his high score on ''Donkey Kong'' after it was threatened by a newcomer to the world of competitive gaming, [[Steve Wiebe]]. A VHS tape that Mitchell gave to Twin Galaxies during the course of the documentary proved to be instrumental in the 2018 investigation into Mitchell's cheating, with the team who led the investigation citing the film's DVD extras as a crucial piece of evidence in exposing Mitchell.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In addition to professional gaming, Mitchell owns the Rickey's World Famous Restaurant chain based in [[Hollywood, Florida]], and sells a line of hot sauces known as Rickey's World Famous Sauces.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;Modell, Josh (February 7, 2008). [http://www.avclub.com/article/the-king-of-kong-continued-donkey-kong-champ-billy-2159 "''The King Of Kong'', continued: Donkey Kong champ Billy Mitchell calls ''The A.V. Club'' out of the blue"]. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mitchell was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and grew up in [[South Florida]]. He began playing games at age 12. Already a pinball player, he was initially uninterested in video games, which appeared in the early 1980s, until he noticed that "everyone was standing around the ''Donkey Kong'' machine and wanted attention."&lt;ref name="oxford_american"/&gt;

Mitchell attended [[Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School]] in 1983 and soon began work as a manager in the kitchen of his parents' restaurant, "Rickey's Restaurant."  Mitchell assumed ownership of the Rickey's World Famous Hot Sauce in the mid-1980s, continuing to own and manage it {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.

In 2015, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against [[Cartoon Network]] saying that in ''[[Regular Show]]'' a character who cheats at video games called Garrett Bobby Ferguson (GBF) infringed on his likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gawker.com/judge-throws-out-former-donkey-kong-record-holders-laws-1744324598 |title=Judge Throws Out Former Donkey Kong Record Holder's Lawsuit Against Cartoon Network |publisher=[[Gawker]] |first=Brendan |last=O'Connor |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127032818/http://gawker.com/judge-throws-out-former-donkey-kong-record-holders-laws-1744324598 |archivedate=November 27, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-11-24-donkey-kong-diva-denied-in-cartoon-network-depiction-lawsuit|title=Donkey Kong diva denied in Cartoon Network depiction lawsuit|first= Tom |last=Phillips |date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] Judge [[Anne Elise Thompson]] threw out the lawsuit, saying that "the television character does not match the plaintiff in appearance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/billy-mitchell-loses-regular-show-lawsuit-doesnt-c-228906|title=Billy Mitchell loses Regular Show lawsuit, doesn’t care as long as he’s trending|first= Mike |last=Vanderbilt|website=[[The A.V.

Mitchell has a long-standing and well-publicized rivalry with his ''King of Kong'' co-star Roy Shildt (a.k.a. "Mr. Awesome"); according to that film, animosity first developed between the men after Mitchell caused Shildt's high score on [[Missile Command]] to be called into question. Shildt, in turn, has disputed Mitchell's credibility and accused him of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5021714/an-awesome-interview-with-missile-commands-mr-awesome|title=An Awesome Interview With Missile Command's Mr. Awesome|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metafilter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metafilter.com/42506/The-seedy-darkside-ofVideo-Game-World-Records|title=The seedy darkside of....Video Game World Records.|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonintendo.com/s/147892-roy-mr-awesome-shildt-calls-billy-mitchell-a-cheater-claims-to-know-all-the-secrets|title=Roy "Mr.Awesome" Shildt calls Billy Mitchell a cheater, claims to know 'ALL the secrets'|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an incident during the 2010 "International Video Game Hall of Fame" Shildt was ejected from the premises after vehemently defaming Mitchell in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/mr-awesome-champion-gamer-playgirl-model-5902517|title=Mr. Awesome: Champion Gamer, Playgirl Model|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell has stated that he avoids interaction with Shildt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-king-of-kong-continued-donkey-kong-champ-billy-2159|title=The King Of Kong, continued: Donkey Kong champ Billy Mitchell calls The A.V.

==Personal life==
Mitchell has long hair and wears neckties showing [[American patriotism]] during game competitions. The neckties appeared during his 1999 race to become the first person to achieve a perfect game of "Pac-Man." One of his competitors, Rick Fothergill, wore a [[Canadian flag]] cape and called himself "Captain Canada." Mitchell began wearing his patriotic ties in response.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt;

Mitchell's youngest child, William "Billy" Mitchell III, is ranked as a top [[American football]] prospect among [[placekicker|kickers]] in the high school class of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrissailerkicking.com/player-rankings/?year=2017|title=Chris Sailer Kicking &amp; Rubio Long Snapping Player Rankings - Voted best kicking, punting and long snapping camp in the world.|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell is the brother of Karen Harrington, a [[South Florida]] Republican politician who has run two unsuccessful campaigns (2010 and 2012) to replace [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney |first=Michael J. |url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2010/10/karen_harrington_says_debbie_w.php |title=Karen Harrington Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz Is "Within Striking Distance" &amp;#124; New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Blogs.browardpalmbeach.com |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video game career==
[[File:Billy Mitchell on December 19, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Mitchell (center) with fans on December 19, 2007]]

===''The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters''===
The 2007 documentary ''[[The King of Kong|The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'' tells the story of newcomer [[Steve Wiebe]]'s attempt to surpass Billy Mitchell's high score at the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', which Mitchell had set in 1982.

Mitchell never showed up to play the game in the film, though he states the importance of playing in public, saying, "To me, most important is to travel to a sanctioned location, like [[Funspot Family Fun Center|Funspot]] that makes it official; if tomorrow [[Tiger Woods]] golfs a 59, big deal. If he does it at [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta]], that's where it counts." However, throughout the film Wiebe traveled to various locations such as Funspot to play him publicly, and each time Mitchell refused. More controversy arose when at Funspot, Wiebe set the ''Donkey Kong'' live score record and was given official recognition, something he did not receive for sending in a tape in which he scored the first million point game on record. A few hours later, a tape submitted by Mitchell in which he scored over a million points was accepted, and Wiebe lost his record. The film records speculation that Mitchell's tape may have been fraudulent. In Mitchell's hometown later on, Wiebe waited for four days to play Mitchell, who showed up one day and refused to play against Wiebe. In the film, Wiebe, while playing the game says hello to Mitchell, who does not respond, and says to his wife, as he walks away, "There's certain people I don't want to spend too much time with". Mitchell offers no explanation for his behavior towards Wiebe but later explained that at the time of filming, he had not played video games for "more than a year", and that the filmmakers had not given him enough advance warning to train for a public record-breaking attempt.&lt;ref name="mitchellresponds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/king-kong-nemesis-talks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523224902/http://www.1up.com/news/king-kong-nemesis-talks|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 23, 2011|title=Killing Bill: King of Kong's Nemesis Talks Back: News from 1UP.com|first1=Crispin|last1=Boyer|date=February 4, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Gordon]], the film's director, in referring to Mitchell's character says that Mitchell "is a true puppet-master", "a master of information-control" and that there was a lot of "stuff we couldn't include because of inter-state telephone rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Thefilmlot.com|archivedate=November 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107020235/http://www.thefilmlot.com/interviews/INTsgordon.php|url=http://www.thefilmlot.com/interviews/INTsgordon.php|title=Interview: Seth Gordon, Director of The King of Kong|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the film's conclusion, Wiebe beats Mitchell's score to gain a new ''Donkey Kong'' record on tape.

In a 2007 interview, Mitchell has stated that he never expected to play the role of the villain and did not anticipate hate mail and badgering phone calls he would receive post-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1560691/ex-donkey-kong-champ-finally-speaks-after-getting-bruised-by-new-doc|title=Ex-'Donkey Kong' Champ Finally Speaks After Getting Bruised By New Doc|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records after ''King of Kong''===
On July 26, 2007, on the 25th anniversary of Mitchell's first record-setting performance, Mitchell again retook the ''Donkey Kong'' record with a score of 1,050,200,&lt;ref name="oldhighscore"&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1465 "Man Shatters Donkey Kong World Record Exactly 25 Years After First Setting It in 1982"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221114203/http://twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1465 |date=February 21, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though that score was surpassed on February 26, 2010 by [[Hank Chien]], who was temporarily the record holder of ''Donkey Kong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5488838/salute-your-new-king-of-kong|title=Salute Your New King Of Kong|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell reclaimed his title once again on July 24, 2010; it was the last time he would hold the record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=2213 "Billy Mitchell reclaims world record"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815191313/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=2213 |date=August 15, 2010 }}. Twin Galaxies.&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken numerous times over the next six years by Wiebe, Chien, Wes Copeland, and [[Robbie Lakeman]]; each held the record at least twice in that span.&lt;ref name="August 2010 high score"&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=2264 "Steve Wiebe regains Donkey Kong World Record from Billy Mitchell"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923131650/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=2264 |date=September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/09/06/the-world-record-for-highest-score-in-donkey-kong-has-been-beaten.aspx "The World Record For Highest Score In Donkey Kong Has Been Beaten"].

===Cheating accusations and high score removals===
On February 2, 2018, ''Donkey Kong'' Forum removed three of Mitchell's highest scores from its high-scores list following analysis by Jeremy Young who stated that the scores were set using the [[MAME]] arcade emulator instead of arcade hardware.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/|title=Donkey Kong scoreboard strips Billy Mitchell’s high score claims|work=Ars Technica|access-date=February 4, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell stated on the [[East Side Dave|East Side Dave Show]], "I’ve never even played MAME. I don’t have MAME loaded in my home." Mitchell continues by saying "The film footage that he has, that Jeremy has, shows MAME play... I’m not disputing what he says. What I’m disputing is the fact that I want him to have the original tape.”&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-breaks-silence-about-donkey-kong-high-sc-1822815818/|title=Billy Mitchell Breaks Silence About Donkey Kong High Score Controversy|work=Kotaku|access-date=February 18, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young's analysis has been criticized by Mitchell as being from an altered tape that otherwise matches Mitchell's gameplay pixel-for-pixel, to which Young responds that "The amount of foresight, patience, and technical knowledge required would be staggering" to make such tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/23/17039412/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-twin-galaxies-explainer|title=The case against an all-time Donkey Kong great, explained|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=February 23, 2018|website=Polygon|access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2018, Twin Galaxies announced that an investigation conducted into Mitchell's submitted scores found conclusive evidence that Mitchell did not use an original unmodified ''Donkey Kong'' circuit board for the footage of his two high scores, but could not confirm that he was specifically  using MAME software. Twin Galaxies said that they had removed Mitchell's scores from their records and that he would be prohibited from submitting scores in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/1047/billy-mitchells-donkey-kong-and-all-other-records-removed/4|title=Dispute Decision: Billy Mitchell's Donkey Kong &amp; All Other Records Removed|website=Twin Galaxies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Subsequently, [[Guinness World Records]] released a statement that it would be removing all of Mitchell's scores as well: "The Guinness World Records titles relating to Mr. Mitchell’s highest scores on ''Donkey Kong'' have all been disqualified due to Twin Galaxies being our source of verification for these achievements."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/billy-mitchell-pac-man-world-record-1202752594/|title=Guinness World Records Disqualifies Billy Mitchell’s Perfect ‘Pac-Man’ Run, Other Achievements|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=April 13, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal also includes Mitchell's Pac-Man high score and first recorded perfect game: "Twin Galaxies was the original source of verification for these record titles and in line with their decision to remove all of Mr. Mitchell’s records from their system, we have disqualified Mr. Mitchell as the holder of these two records."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

To date, Mitchell has a single publicly witnessed ''Donkey Kong'' high score of 933,900 from 2004.&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt; In August 2018, Mitchell scored 1,047,500 on a [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] live stream.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/298256478&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable scores==
Mitchell set high score records on a number of games in the 1980s and 1990s.  Decades after his 1982 setting of an initial highest score in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and after a return to record-breaking achievements between 2004 and 2010, others have matched or surpassed Mitchell's accomplishments.  None of these records are considered valid by [[Twin Galaxies]] or by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as of April 12, 2018.

* Together with friend Chris Ayra they reached the "[[Pac-Man#Kill screen|split-screen]]" level 256 of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' in mid 1983.&lt;ref name="oxford_american"/&gt; Mitchell commented on this in 2016 by saying he had achieved "perfection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoVvgSwPDYk|title=Meet the Man Who Beat 'Pac-Man'|first=|last=Great Big Story|date=July 21, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He achieved the first acknowledged highest overall score on ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', with 886,900 in 1982.&lt;ref name="oxford_american"/&gt;
* He moved the record score for ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' to 703,560 in January 1985. This score was not surpassed until 2001, by Chris Ayra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. Pac-Man points records|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/scores.php?scores=1386|publisher=Twin Galaxies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He moved the record score for ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' to 957,300 in 2004.&lt;ref name="highscores"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/scores.php?player=28206|title=Billy L Mitchell (profile) |publisher=[[Twin Galaxies]] International |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He moved the record score for ''[[BurgerTime]]'' to 7,881,050 in 1984. This score was not surpassed until 2005.&lt;ref name="highscores" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spyhunter007.com/bryan_wagner_burgertime_world_record.htm|title=bryan wagner burgertime world record|publisher=spyhunter007.com|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He became fifth (and latest, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}) person to achieve a score on ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', in marathon play, of more than 10 million points, achieved July 8, 1985.&lt;ref name="highscores"/&gt;
* He recaptured the world records for both ''Donkey Kong'' (1,062,800 points) and ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' (1,270,900) on the weekend of July 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=2213 |title=BILLY MITCHELL TAKES BACK DONKEY KONG RECORDS |author=Matthew Bradford |date=August 7, 2010 |publisher=[[Twin Galaxies]] International |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815191313/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=2213 |archivedate=August 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, both these records were surpassed.&lt;ref name="highscores"/&gt; The ''Donkey Kong'' record was first removed in February 2018 by the ''Donkey Kong'' forums.  This process and evidence produced helped to lead Twin Galaxies to remove the records in April 2018 after an investigation concluded Mitchell did not use an original unmodified version of the ''Donkey Kong'' arcade hardware, instead using an [[video game emulator|emulator]] or other disallowed means to achieve it.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|work=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/king-of-kong-stripped-of-title-1202751358/|title=‘King of Kong’ Star Stripped of High Scores, Banned From Competition|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence to suggest that the score was falsified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Orland |first=Kyle |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/ |title=Donkey Kong scoreboard strips Billy Mitchell’s high score claims [Updated] |work=Ars Technica |date=February 3, 2018 |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and legacy==
On January 14, 1984, he was selected as one of the 1983 "Video Game Players of the Year" by [[Twin Galaxies]] and the [[U.S. National Video Game Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1033 "Twin Galaxies' Coronation Day Crowns Video's Best of '83"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311171236/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1033 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1999, he was proclaimed the "Video Game Player of the Century" while at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In a ceremony on the [[Namco]] stage, company founder  [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] presented Mitchell with an award commemorating the first "perfect" game on ''Pac-Man''.&lt;ref name="oxford_american" /&gt;

On November 24, 1999, he offered $100,000 to the first person who could get through ''Pac-Man'''s [[Split-Screen Level|"split-screen level"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=305 Billy Mitchell Offers $100,000 for solving Pac-Man "Split-Screen"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122233755/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=305 |date=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was never claimed before the January 1, 2000 deadline.

On June 21, 2006, MTV selected Mitchell one of "The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers of All Time." He was also nominated as leader of the Nerd Herd.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534641/20060620/index.jhtml?headlines=true&amp;rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler%22MTV|title=Playa Rater: The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers Of All Time|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell had been featured previously in the [[True Life]] episode "I'm A Gamer" in 2003.

Mitchell placed eighth out of eight in the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox 360]] ''Pac-Man'' World Championships on June 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/06/07/chasing-pellets-pac-man-tries-to-make-history-again/|title=Chasing pellets: Pac-Man tries to make history again|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Mitchell became the first video game player to be honored with a [[Topps|Topps Allen &amp; Ginter]] trading card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Mitchell Appears on TOPPS Gum Card|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1622|publisher=Twin Galaxies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511210941/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1622|archivedate=May 11, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 feature film ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'', [[Peter Dinklage]] plays former video game champion "Eddie", with physical appearance and personality styled after Mitchell and other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=44358 |title=New Pixels Promo Arrives Online &amp;#124; Movie News &amp;#124; Empire|newspaper=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SonyPIX/status/818859953888731137|title=Sony PIX on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character similar to Mitchell called Garrett Bobby Ferguson (GBF) appears in ''[[Regular Show]]''. Mitchell, however, took offense at the portrayal (a villain who cheats at video games) and filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/billy-mitchell-loses-regular-show-lawsuit-doesnt-c-228906|title=Billy Mitchell loses Regular Show lawsuit, doesn’t care as long as he’s trending|date=November 24, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/court-king-of-kongs-billy-mitchell-isnt-an-exploding-floating-cartoon-head/|title=Court: King of Kong’s Billy Mitchell isn’t an exploding, floating cartoon head|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In United States films of the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] between the 1920s and the 1940s, white hats were often worn by heroes and black hats by villains to symbolize the contrast in good versus evil.&lt;ref name="agnew"&gt;{{cite book | last=Agnew | first=Jeremy | year=2012 | title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-6888-1 | page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1903 short film ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' was the first to apply this convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Etulain | first=Richard W. | year=1996 | title=Re-imagining the Modern American West: A Century of Fiction, History, and Art | publisher=University of Arizona Press | isbn=978-0-8165-1683-4 | pages=29–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two exceptions to the convention were portrayals by [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] (active 1918–1954), who wore dark clothing as [[Hopalong Cassidy]], and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]'s portrayal in the film ''[[The Law and Jake Wade]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name="agnew" /&gt;

The book ''Investigating Information Society'' said the convention was arbitrarily imposed by filmmakers in the genre with the expectation that audiences would understand the categorizations. It said whiteness was associated with "purity, cleanliness, and moral righteousness", which is reminiscent of a woman's [[wedding dress]] traditionally being white. The book said, "The difference, of course, has to do with particular cultural conceptions of gender and sexuality and the context within which white is worn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Mackay | first1=Hugh | last2=Maples | first2=Wendy | last3=Reynolds | first3=Paul | year=2013 | title=Investigating Information Society | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-136-45297-0 | page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Western films referenced the convention in different ways. In the 2005 film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', one of the two starring cowboys wears black while the other wears white. The film does not disclose any standard conventions for the symbolism other than the wearer of the black hat being shot like in early films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kord | first1=Susanne | last2=Krimmer | first2=Elisabeth | year=2013 | title=Contemporary Hollywood Masculinities: Gender, Genre, and Politics | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | isbn=978-1-137-01621-8 | page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 film ''[[3:10 to Yuma (2007 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]'', a remake of [[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|the 1957 film]], a henchman hiring local gunmen to free his boss from jail, tells them not to shoot at "the black hat", a light reference to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carroll | first=Rachel | year=2009 | title=Adaptation in Contemporary Culture: Textual Infidelities | publisher=A&amp;C Black | isbn=978-0-8264-2464-8 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This convention gave rise to the terms [[black hat]] and [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] to refer to malicious and ethical hackers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVnA8pQmS54C&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Ninja Hacking: Unconventional Penetration Testing Tactics and Techniques |first=Thomas |last=Wilhelm |first2=Jason |last2=Andress |publisher=Elsevier |year=2010 |pages=26-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], an author uses '''contrast''' when he or she describes the difference(s) between two or more entities. For example, in the first four lines of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Sonnet 130]]'', Shakespeare contrasts a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.

Contrast is the antonym of [[simile]]. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, [[John Donne]] and the [[metaphysical poetry|metaphysical poets]] developed the [[conceit]] as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In [[Renaissance]] poetry, and particularly in [[sonnet]]s, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of ''my love is unlike all other women'' or ''I am unlike her other loves''.

In the early 18th century, a theory of [[wit]] developed by English writers (particularly [[John Locke]]) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In [[lyric poetry]], the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.

In [[game theory]], a '''cooperative game''' (or '''coalitional game''') is a game with competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through [[contract law]]). Those are opposed to [[non-cooperative game]]s in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/Non-CooperativeGame.html|title=Non-Cooperative Game - Game Theory .net|last=Shor|first=Mike|website=www.gametheory.net|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative games are often analysed through the framework of '''cooperative game theory,''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional [[Non-cooperative game|non-cooperative game theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~chandra/documents/6311/coopgames.pdf|title=Cooperative Game Theory|last=Chandrasekaran|first=R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uib.cat/depart/deeweb/pdi/hdeelbm0/arxius_decisions_and_games/cooperative_game_theory-brandenburger.pdf|title=Cooperative Game Theory: Characteristic Functions, Allocations, Marginal Contribution|last=Brandenburger|first=Adam|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows the analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.

== Mathematical definition ==

A cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, called the ''grand coalition'', and a ''characteristic function'' &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies &lt;math&gt; v( \emptyset ) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition, and the game is sometimes called a ''value game'' or a ''profit game''. 

Conversely, a cooperative game can also be defined with a characteristic cost function &lt;math&gt; c: 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; c( \emptyset ) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting, players must accomplish some task, and the characteristic function &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; represents the cost of a set of players accomplishing the task together. A game of this kind is known as a ''cost game''. Although most cooperative game theory deals with profit games, all concepts can easily be translated to the cost setting.

==Harsanyi dividend ==

The ''Harsanyi dividend'' (named after [[John Harsanyi]], who used it to generalize the [[Shapley value]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-2527-9_3|title=Papers in Game Theory|last=Harsanyi|first=John C.|date=1982|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048183692|series=Theory and Decision Library|pages=44–70|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2527-9_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) identifies the surplus that is created by a coalition of players in a cooperative game. To specify this surplus, the worth of this coalition is corrected by the surplus that is already created by subcoalitions. To this end, the dividend &lt;math&gt;d_v(S)&lt;/math&gt; of coalition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is recursively determined by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d_v(\{i\})&amp;= v(\{i\}) \\
d_v(\{i,j\})&amp;= v(\{i,j\})-d_v(\{i\})-d_v(\{j\}) \\
d_v(\{i,j,k\})&amp;= v(\{i,j,k\})-d_v(\{i,j\})-d_v(\{i,k\})-d_v(\{j,k\})-d_v(\{i\})-d_v(\{j\})-d_v(\{k\})\\
&amp;\vdots \\
d_v(S) &amp;= v(S) - \sum_{T\subsetneq S }d_v(T)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An explicit formula for the dividend is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d_v(S)=\sum_{T\subsetneq S }(-1)^{|S\setminus T|}v(T)&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt; d_v:2^N \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the [[Möbius transformation|Möbius inverse]] of &lt;math&gt; v:2^N \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319306889|title=Set Functions, Games and Capacities in Decision Making {{!}} Michel Grabisch {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, we can recover &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;d_v&lt;/math&gt; by help of the formula &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v(S) = \sum_{T\subseteq S }d_v(T)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Harsanyi dividends are useful for analyzing both games and solution concepts, e.g. the [[Shapley value]] is obtained by distributing the dividend of each coalition among its members, i.e., the Shapley value &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)&lt;/math&gt; of player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is given by summing up a player's share of the dividends of all coalitions that she belongs to, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi_i(v)=\sum_{S\subset N: i \in S }{d_v(S)}/{|S|}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Duality ==

Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a profit game. The ''dual game'' of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the cost game &lt;math&gt; v^* &lt;/math&gt; defined as

: &lt;math&gt; v^*(S) = v(N) - v( N \setminus S ), \forall~ S \subseteq N.&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, the dual game represents the [[opportunity cost]] for a coalition &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; of not joining the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. A dual profit game &lt;math&gt; c^* &lt;/math&gt; can be defined identically for a cost game &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;. A cooperative game and its dual are in some sense equivalent, and they share many properties. For example, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of a game and its dual are equal. For more details on cooperative game duality, see for instance {{harv|Bilbao|2000}}.

== Subgames ==

Let &lt;math&gt; S \subsetneq N &lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty coalition of players. The ''subgame'' &lt;math&gt; v_S : 2^S \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is naturally defined as

: &lt;math&gt; v_S(T) = v(T), \forall~ T \subseteq S.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, we simply restrict our attention to coalitions contained in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;. Subgames are useful because they allow us to apply [[#Solution concepts|solution concepts]] defined for the grand coalition on smaller coalitions.

== Properties for characterization ==
=== Superadditivity ===
Characteristic functions are often assumed to be [[superadditive]] {{harv|Owen|1995|p=213}}. This means that the value of a union of [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] coalitions is no less than the sum of the coalitions' separate values:

&lt;math&gt; v ( S \cup T ) \geq v (S) + v (T) &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt; S, T \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt; S \cap T = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Monotonicity ===
Larger coalitions gain more:

&lt;math&gt; S \subseteq T \Rightarrow v (S) \le v (T) &lt;/math&gt;. 

This follows from [[superadditive|superadditivity]]. i.e. if payoffs are normalized so singleton coalitions have zero value.

=== Properties for simple games ===
A coalitional game {{mvar|v}} is considered '''simple''' if payoffs are either 1 or 0, i.e. coalitions are either "winning" or "losing".

Equivalently, a '''simple game''' can be defined as a collection {{mvar|W}} of coalitions, where the members of {{mvar|W}} are called '''winning''' coalitions, and the others '''losing''' coalitions.
It is sometimes assumed that a simple game is nonempty or that it does not contain an empty set. However, in other areas of mathematics, simple games are also called [[hypergraph]]s or [[Boolean functions]] (logic functions).

* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''monotonic''' if any coalition containing a winning coalition is also winning, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt;T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.
* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''proper''' if the complement (opposition) of any winning coalition is losing, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \notin W&lt;/math&gt;.
* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''strong''' if the complement of any losing coalition is winning, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \notin W&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \in W&lt;/math&gt;.
** If a simple game {{mvar|W}} is proper and strong, then  a coalition is winning if and only if its complement is losing, that is, &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; iff  &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \notin W&lt;/math&gt;. (If {{mvar|v}} is a colitional simple game that is proper and strong, &lt;math&gt;v(S) = 1 - v(N \setminus S)&lt;/math&gt; for any {{mvar|S}}.)
* A '''veto player''' (vetoer) in a simple game is a player that belongs to all winning coalitions. Supposing there is a veto player, any coalition not containing a veto player is losing.  A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''weak''' (''collegial'') if it has a veto player, that is, if the intersection &lt;math&gt;\bigcap W := \bigcap_{S\in W} S&lt;/math&gt; of all winning coalitions is nonempty.
** A '''dictator''' in a simple game is a veto player such that any coalition containing this player is winning.  The dictator does not belong to any losing coalition. ([[Dictator game]]s in experimental economics are unrelated to this.)
* A '''carrier'''  of a simple game {{mvar|W}} is a set &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; such that for any coalition {{mvar|S}}, we have &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;S\cap T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.  When a simple game has a carrier, any player not belonging to it is ignored.  A simple game is sometimes called ''finite'' if it has a finite carrier (even if {{mvar|N}} is infinite).
* The '''[[Nakamura number]]''' of a simple game is the minimal number of ''winning coalitions'' with empty intersection.  According to Nakamura's theorem, the number measures the degree of rationality; it is an indicator of the extent to which an aggregation rule can yield well-defined choices.

A few relations among the above axioms have widely been recognized, such as the following
(e.g., Peleg, 2002, Section 2.1&lt;ref name=peleg02hbscw&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Peleg | first1 = B. | chapter = Chapter 8 Game-theoretic analysis of voting in committees | doi = 10.1016/S1574-0110(02)80012-1 | title = Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare Volume 1 | series = Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 1 | pages = 195–201 | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780444829146 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;):

* If a simple game is weak, it is proper.
* A simple game is dictatorial if and only if it is strong and weak.

More generally, a complete investigation of the relation among the four conventional axioms

whose results are summarized in the Table "Existence of Simple Games" below.

The restrictions that various axioms for simple games impose on their [[Nakamura number]] were also studied extensively. &lt;ref name= kumabe-m08scw&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumabe | first1 = M. | last2 = Mihara | first2 = H. R. | title = The Nakamura numbers for computable simple games| journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | page = 621 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s00355-008-0300-5 | url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/3684.htm| arxiv = 1107.0439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, a computable simple game without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is a ''proper'' and ''non-strong'' game.

== Relation with non-cooperative theory ==

Let ''G'' be a strategic (non-cooperative) game. Then, assuming that coalitions have the ability to enforce coordinated behaviour, there are several cooperative games associated with ''G''. These games are often referred to as ''representations of G''. The two standard representations are:&lt;ref&gt;Aumann, Robert J. "The core of a cooperative game without side payments." Transactions of the American Mathematical Society (1961): 539-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The α-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can 'guarantee' by joining forces. By 'guaranteeing', it is meant that the value is the max-min, e.g. the maximal value of the minimum taken over the opposition's strategies.
* The β-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can 'strategically guarantee' by joining forces. By 'strategically guaranteeing', it is meant that the value is the min-max, e.g. the minimal value of the maximum taken over the opposition's strategies.

== Solution concepts ==

The main assumption in cooperative game theory is that the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; will form.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The challenge is then to allocate the payoff &lt;math&gt; v(N) &lt;/math&gt; among the players in some fair way. (This assumption is not restrictive, because even if players split off and form smaller coalitions, we can apply solution concepts to the subgames defined by whatever coalitions actually form.)  A ''solution concept'' is a vector &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; that represents the allocation to each player. Researchers have proposed different solution concepts based on different notions of fairness. Some properties to look for in a solution concept include:

* Efficiency: The payoff vector exactly splits the total value: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N) &lt;/math&gt;.
* Individual rationality: No player receives less than what he could get on his own: &lt;math&gt; x_i \geq v(\{i\}), \forall~ i \in N &lt;/math&gt;.
* Existence: The solution concept exists for any game &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;.
* Uniqueness: The solution concept is unique for any game &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;.
* Marginality: The payoff of a player depends only on the marginal contribution of this player, i.e., if these marginal contributions are the same in two different games, then the payoff is the same: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = w( S \cup \{ i \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the same in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
* Monotonicity: The payoff of a player increases if the marginal contribution of this player increase: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) \leq w( S \cup \{ i \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is weakly greater in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; than in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
* Computational ease: The solution concept can be calculated efficiently (i.e. in polynomial time with respect to the number of players &lt;math&gt; |N| &lt;/math&gt;.)
* Symmetry: The solution concept &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; allocates equal payments &lt;math&gt; x_i = x_j &lt;/math&gt; to symmetric players &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;. Two players &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; are ''symmetric'' if &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = v( S \cup \{ j \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i, j \} &lt;/math&gt;; that is, we can exchange one player for the other in any coalition that contains only one of the players and not change the payoff.
* Additivity: The allocation to a player in a sum of two games is the sum of the allocations to the player in each individual game. Mathematically, if &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are games, the game &lt;math&gt; ( v + \omega ) &lt;/math&gt; simply assigns to any coalition the sum of the payoffs the coalition would get in the two individual games. An additive solution concept assigns to every player in &lt;math&gt; ( v + \omega ) &lt;/math&gt; the sum of what he would receive in &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;.
* Zero Allocation to Null Players: The allocation to a null player is zero. A ''null player'' &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = v( S ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt;. In economic terms, a null player's marginal value to any coalition that does not contain him is zero.

An efficient payoff vector is called a ''pre-imputation'', and an individually rational pre-imputation is called an [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]]. Most solution concepts are imputations.

=== {{vanchor|The stable set|von Neumann-Morgenstern solution}} ===

The stable set of a game (also known as the ''von Neumann-Morgenstern solution'' {{harv|von Neumann|Morgenstern|1944}}) was the first solution proposed for games with more than 2 players. Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a game and let &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; be two [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; ''dominates'' &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; if some coalition &lt;math&gt; S \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt; x_i &gt; y _i, \forall~ i \in S &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \leq v(S) &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, players in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; prefer the payoffs from &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; to those from &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;, and they can threaten to leave the grand coalition if &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; is used because the payoff they obtain on their own is at least as large as the allocation they receive under &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

A ''stable set'' is a set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] that satisfies two properties:

* Internal stability: No payoff vector in the stable set is dominated by another vector in the set.
* External stability: All payoff vectors outside the set are dominated by at least one vector in the set.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern saw the stable set as the collection of acceptable behaviours in a society: None is clearly preferred to any other, but for each unacceptable behaviour there is a preferred alternative. The definition is very general allowing the concept to be used in a wide variety of game formats.

==== Properties ====

* A stable set may or may not exist {{harv|Lucas|1969}}, and if it exists it is typically not unique {{harv|Lucas|1992}}. Stable sets are usually difficult to find. This and other difficulties have led to the development of many other solution concepts.
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have unique stable sets consisting of the [[Core (economics)|core]] {{harv|Owen|1995|p=240}}.
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have stable sets which discriminate &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; players. In such sets at least &lt;math&gt;n-3&lt;/math&gt; of the discriminated players are excluded {{harv|Owen|1995|p=240}}.

=== The core ===
{{main article|Core (economics)}}

Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a game. The [[Core (economics)|''core'']] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the set of payoff vectors

: &lt;math&gt; C( v ) = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N: \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N); \quad \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \geq v(S), \forall~ S \subseteq N \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the core is the set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] under which no coalition has a value greater than the sum of its members' payoffs. Therefore, no coalition has incentive to leave the grand coalition and receive a larger payoff.

==== Properties ====

* The [[Core (economics)|core]] of a game may be empty (see the [[Bondareva–Shapley theorem]]). Games with non-empty cores are called ''balanced''.
* If it is non-empty, the core does not necessarily contain a unique vector.
* The [[Core (economics)|core]] is contained in any stable set, and if the core is stable it is the unique stable set; see {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for a proof.

=== The core of a simple game with respect to preferences ===

For simple games, there is another notion of the core, when each player is assumed to have preferences on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of alternatives.
A ''profile'' is a list &lt;math&gt;p=(\succ_i^p)_{i \in N}&lt;/math&gt; of individual preferences &lt;math&gt;\succ_i^p&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; means that individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; prefers alternative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; at profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a simple game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and a profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, a ''dominance'' relation &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt; is defined
on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x \succ^p_v y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a winning coalition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., &lt;math&gt;v(S)=1&lt;/math&gt;) satisfying &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''core'' &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; of the simple game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences
is the set of alternatives undominated by &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt;
(the set of maximal elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt;):

: &lt;math&gt;x \in C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is no &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y \succ^p_v x&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''Nakamura number'' of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection.
''Nakamura's theorem'' states that the core &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''acyclic'' (alternatively, ''transitive'') preferences
if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite ''and'' the cardinal number (the number of elements) of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is less than the Nakamura number of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
A variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have a ''maximal element''
if and only if the cardinal number of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is less than the Nakamura number of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  (See [[Nakamura number]] for details.)

=== The strong epsilon-core ===

Because the [[Core (economics)|core]] may be empty, a generalization was introduced in {{harv|Shapley|Shubik|1966}}. The ''strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core'' for some number &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of payoff vectors

: &lt;math&gt; C_\varepsilon( v ) = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N: \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N); \quad \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \geq v(S) - \varepsilon, \forall~ S \subseteq N \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

In economic terms, the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core is the set of pre-imputations where no coalition can improve its payoff by leaving the grand coalition, if it must pay a penalty of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; for leaving. Note that &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; may be negative, in which case it represents a bonus for leaving the grand coalition. Clearly, regardless of whether the [[Core (economics)|core]] is empty, the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core will be non-empty for a large enough value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; and empty for a small enough (possibly negative) value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Following this line of reasoning, the ''least-core'', introduced in {{harv|Maschler|Peleg|Shapley|1979}}, is the intersection of all non-empty strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-cores. It can also be viewed as the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core for the smallest value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; that makes the set non-empty {{harv|Bilbao|2000}}.

=== The Shapley value ===
{{main article|Shapley value}}

The ''Shapley value'' is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, and satisfies monotonicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=H. P.|date=1985-06-01|title=Monotonic solutions of cooperative games|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01769885|journal=International Journal of Game Theory|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=65–72|doi=10.1007/BF01769885|issn=0020-7276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Lloyd Shapley]] {{harv|Shapley|1953}} who showed that it is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, additive, and assigns zero payoffs to dummy players. The Shapley value of a [[superadditive]] game is individually rational, but this is not true in general. {{harv|Driessen|1988}}

=== The kernel ===

Let &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; be a game, and let &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; be an efficient payoff vector. The ''maximum surplus'' of player ''i'' over player ''j'' with respect to ''x'' is

: &lt;math&gt; s_{ij}^v(x) = \max \left\{ v(S) - \sum_{ k \in S } x_k : S \subseteq N \setminus \{ j \}, i \in S \right\}, &lt;/math&gt;

the maximal amount player ''i'' can gain without the cooperation of player ''j'' by withdrawing from the grand coalition ''N'' under payoff vector ''x'', assuming that the other players in ''i'''s withdrawing coalition are satisfied with their payoffs under ''x''. The maximum surplus is a way to measure one player's bargaining power over another. The ''kernel'' of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] ''x'' that satisfy

* &lt;math&gt; ( s_{ij}^v(x) - s_{ji}^v(x) ) \times ( x_j - v(j) ) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt; ( s_{ji}^v(x) - s_{ij}^v(x) ) \times ( x_i - v(i) ) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for every pair of players ''i'' and ''j''. Intuitively, player ''i'' has more bargaining power than player ''j'' with respect to [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]] ''x'' if &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}^v(x) &gt; s_{ji}^v(x)&lt;/math&gt;, but player ''j'' is immune to player ''i'''s threats if &lt;math&gt; x_j = v(j) &lt;/math&gt;, because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in {{harv|Davis|Maschler|1965}}.

=== The nucleolus ===

Let &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; be a game, and let &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; be a payoff vector. The ''excess'' of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; for a coalition &lt;math&gt; S \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; is the quantity &lt;math&gt; v(S) - \sum_{ i \in S } x_i &lt;/math&gt;; that is, the gain that players in coalition &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can obtain if they withdraw from the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; under payoff &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and instead take the payoff &lt;math&gt; v(S) &lt;/math&gt;.

Now let &lt;math&gt; \theta(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{ 2^N } &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of excesses of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, arranged in non-increasing order. In other words, &lt;math&gt; \theta_i(x) \geq \theta_j(x), \forall~ i &lt; j &lt;/math&gt;. Notice that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is in the [[Core (economics)|core]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is a pre-imputation and &lt;math&gt; \theta_1(x) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. To define the nucleolus, we consider the lexicographic ordering of vectors in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{ 2^N } &lt;/math&gt;: For two payoff vectors &lt;math&gt; x, y &lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt; \theta(x) &lt;/math&gt; is lexicographically smaller than &lt;math&gt; \theta(y) &lt;/math&gt; if for some index &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; \theta_i(x) = \theta_i(y), \forall~ i &lt; k &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \theta_k(x) &lt; \theta_k(y) &lt;/math&gt;. (The ordering is called lexicographic because it mimics alphabetical ordering used to arrange words in a dictionary.) The ''nucleolus'' of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the lexicographically minimal [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]], based on this ordering. This solution concept was first introduced in {{harv|Schmeidler|1969}}.

Although the definition of the nucleolus seems abstract, {{harv|Maschler|Peleg|Shapley|1979}} gave a more intuitive description: Starting with the least-core, record the coalitions for which the right-hand side of the inequality in the definition of &lt;math&gt; C_\varepsilon( v ) &lt;/math&gt; cannot be further reduced without making the set empty. Continue decreasing the right-hand side for the remaining coalitions, until it cannot be reduced without making the set empty. Record the new set of coalitions for which the inequalities hold at equality; continue decreasing the right-hand side of remaining coalitions and repeat this process as many times as necessary until all coalitions have been recorded. The resulting payoff vector is the nucleolus.

==== Properties ====

* Although the definition does not explicitly state it, the nucleolus is always unique. (See Section II.7 of {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for a proof.)
* If the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core.
* The nucleolus is always in the kernel, and since the kernel is contained in the bargaining set, it is always in the bargaining set (see {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for details.)

== {{vanchor|Convex cooperative games|Convex games}} ==

Introduced by [[Lloyd Shapley|Shapley]] in {{harv|Shapley|1971}}, convex cooperative games capture the intuitive property some games have of "snowballing". Specifically, a game is ''convex'' if its characteristic function &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is [[supermodular]]:

: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup T ) + v( S \cap T ) \geq v(S) + v(T), \forall~ S, T \subseteq N.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown (see, e.g., Section V.1 of {{harv|Driessen|1988}}) that the [[supermodular]]ity of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) - v(S) \leq v( T \cup \{ i \} ) - v(T), \forall~ S \subseteq T \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \}, \forall~ i \in N;&lt;/math&gt;

that is, "the incentives for joining a coalition increase as the coalition grows" {{harv|Shapley|1971}}, leading to the aforementioned snowball effect. For cost games, the inequalities are reversed, so that we say the cost game is ''convex'' if the characteristic function is [[submodular]].

=== Properties ===

Convex cooperative games have many nice properties:

* [[Supermodularity]] trivially implies [[superadditivity]].
* Convex games are ''totally balanced'': The [[Core (economics)|core]] of a convex game is non-empty, and since any subgame of a convex game is convex, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of any subgame is also non-empty.
* A convex game has a unique stable set that coincides with its [[Core (economics)|core]].
* The [[Shapley value]] of a convex game is the center of gravity of its [[Core (economics)|core]].
* An [[extreme point]] (vertex) of the [[Core (economics)|core]] can be found in polynomial time using the [[greedy algorithm]]: Let &lt;math&gt; \pi: N \to N &lt;/math&gt; be a [[permutation]] of the players, and let &lt;math&gt; S_i = \{ j \in N: \pi(j) \leq i \} &lt;/math&gt; be the set of players ordered &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt; i = 0, \ldots, n &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; S_0 = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;. Then the payoff &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; x_i = v( S_{\pi(i)} ) - v( S_{\pi(i) - 1}  ), \forall~ i \in N &lt;/math&gt; is a vertex of the [[Core (economics)|core]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Any vertex of the [[Core (economics)|core]] can be constructed in this way by choosing an appropriate [[permutation]] &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Similarities and differences with combinatorial optimization ===

[[Submodular]] and [[supermodular]] set functions are also studied in [[combinatorial optimization]]. Many of the results in {{harv|Shapley|1971}} have analogues in {{harv|Edmonds|1970}}, where [[submodular]] functions were first presented as generalizations of [[matroid]]s. In this context, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of a convex cost game is called the ''base polyhedron'', because its elements generalize base properties of [[matroid]]s.

However, the optimization community generally considers [[submodular]] functions to be the discrete analogues of convex functions {{harv|Lovász|1983}}, because the minimization of both types of functions is computationally tractable. Unfortunately, this conflicts directly with [[Lloyd Shapley|Shapley's]] original definition of [[supermodular]] functions as "convex".

A '''deleted scene''' is [[footage]] that has been removed from the final version of a film or television show. 

A related term is '''extended scene''', the longer version of a scene that was shortened for the final version of the film. Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with for instance, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.

==Reasons for removal==
{{See also|Re-edited film}}
Scenes are often removed from films at the request of a studio or network, or to reduce running time or to improve narrative flow.

===Requests for alteration===
The studio or network planning to air or distribute it may be uncomfortable with a certain scene. It may ask for it be altered, removed, or replaced.

That is most common in the production of television series since networks and channels often must be mindful of how viewers, critics, or censors will react to programming. There may be a fear of losing ratings, being punished by fines or otherwise, or having trouble finding advertisers.

* The 2002 Fox series ''[[Firefly (television series)|Firefly]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s original pilot episode ("[[Serenity (Firefly episode)|Serenity]]", parts 1 and 2) had such a change made, with the original, less action-packed scene being replaced in the final cut of the episode but featuring on the later [[DVD]] box set release of the series, as one of several bonus features.&lt;ref&gt;Joss Whedon, audio commentary in ''Firefly, The Complete Series'' (DVD box set), 21st Century Fox, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

* A scene in the pilot of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' involved the destruction of a [[Boeing 747]]. Aired just a few months after the [[9/11 attacks]], the producers made some creative edits to cutout shots of the plane visibly exploding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = 1-84357-034-3
  | page = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running time===
Concerns about running time may also cause scenes to be removed or shortening.

In feature films, scenes may be cut to reduce the length of the film's theatrical cut. In television serials, however, running time becomes an even greater concern because of the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels supported by advertisements, and there may be only 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot. Depending on the station and the particular format of the show, that may or may not include opening credits or closing credits; many ad-supported stations now "squish" the closing credits or force them into a [[split screen (film)|split-screen]] to show more advertising. Most programs are in either a half-hour or a one-hour timeslot. That forces producers of television serials to break up the [[act (theater)|acts]] in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad break and to avoid exceeding the stricter running time limits.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Disruption of narrative flow===
Though the quality of the initial and the final cuts of a film is subjective, a scene or version of a scene in a film may have an adverse effect on the film as a whole. It may slow the film down, provide unnecessary details or exposition, or even explain points that should be implied or said more subtly. It is common to remove such scenes at the editing level, but they may be released on the home video release, as a bonus feature.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

There are at least a few examples, including a number of the deleted scenes on the DVD release of the sequel film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (in fact, the audio commentary on the DVD's deleted scenes collection quite often mentions the plot or the tension being disrupted or slowed by including a scene or too much [[exposition (literary technique)|expositional]] as the main reason for the scene's removal from the final theatrical cut. Another well known example is the [[Alien (film)#Post-production|cocoon sequence]] in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. The scene added a lot of information about the fate of several crew members and new information on the life cycle of the creature, but it was ultimately deleted, as it was thought to slow down and to disrupt the tension of the end of the film.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

===Animated Deleted Scenes===

==Formats==
Deleted or extended scenes may be in any of several different formats. They may or may not feature finished [[special effect]]s (especially in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] films in which visual effects are more expensive), and the film quality may or may not be the same as in the rest of the film, but that may depend only on how much post-production editing was done.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

Additionally, deleted scenes of animated films may not be in the form of a fully animated scene but instead be included in the form of an [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]] or a [[blooper]] form, as is the case with the deleted scenes on the DVD release of [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Finding Nemo]]'', DVD, [[Pixar]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Parody==

The DVD release for ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s feature film also featured not only a handful of regular deleted scenes but also two spoof "Really Deleted" scenes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', DVD, Touchstone Pictures, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

''YTV''s ZAPX sometimes makes "deleted scenes" that are not genuine deleted scenes but random scenes of the movie with footage of the program's host, Simon, inserted into the clip, for that purpose.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

On the DVD for ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] provides commentary of the deleted scenes and emphasizes that there are hours of film footage but that they were all removed for good reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/65353/uhf-25th-anniversary-edition/|title=UHF (Blu-ray)|author=|date=|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Drew Carey]].

In a preface to the book, Carey states that he wrote every word of it himself—he did not recruit a [[ghost writer]] although, as he says, "It probably would have been easier."

The book was mentioned briefly in an episode of the US version of the improv comedy TV series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line is it Anyway?]],'' a show which Drew himself hosted from 1998 to 2003. During a game of "Scenes From a Hat," Drew pulled out the subject "books least likely to be checked out at the library" and friend [[Ryan Stiles]] acted as if he was picking a book and read the title "Dirty Jokes and Beer."

==Sections==
The book is divided into three sections, which are referred to in the title. All of the chapters within the first two sections (save for ''101 Big-Dick Jokes'', which "would be redundant") are preceded by a dirty joke Carey has heard over the years.

===The "Dirty Jokes" section===
The first section deals with Drew's views on various topics, such as being at [[airports]] (he writes that he likes to ride around in the carts to make people move out of his way) and the difference between [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]]. (Carey writes that he prefers Las Vegas, as he sees Atlantic City as being filled with retired people shuffling around, playing nickel slot machines.) The section ends with ''101 Big [[Penis|Dick]] Jokes''.

===The "Beer" section===
This section of the book contains the [[autobiographical]] stories. Drew briefly discusses his upbringing and his time with the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]], as well as his experiences working on [[The Drew Carey Show|his show]]. In this section, he also includes reviews about his show, both positive and negative, as well as some of the notes he received from network censors about the show's content.

==="The Stories Of The Unrefined"===
This section contains five short stories that Drew wrote for the book. He describes these stories as being "Drew in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]],"'' where he takes some elements from his life and changes them into fictional stories where he is the main protagonist of the stories. These short stories are not preceded by dirty jokes. The very first story "Mi Plea" was a completely true story, except for the ending. And the stories about his friend Larry and girlfriend Natalie were completely fabricated. As was his story about himself in Las Vegas.

[[Image:Genji emaki azumaya.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Detail from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' handscroll]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Emakimono'''''|絵巻物|emaki-mono|literally 'picture scroll'}}, often simply called {{Nihongo|'''''emaki'''''|絵巻}}, is a horizontal, illustrated narrative form created during the 11th to 16th centuries in [[Japan]]. ''Emakimono'' combines both text and pictures, and is drawn, painted, or stamped on a [[handscroll]].  They depict battles, romance, religion, folk tales, and stories of the supernatural world. 

==History and physical characteristics==
The [[handscroll]] and the [[hanging scroll]] are the two most common forms of Japanese painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-japan.org/museum/emaki/about_em.html Overview of Scroll Painting (Emaki)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Handscrolls are painted on paper or silk, backed with paper. The farthest (left) end is fitted with a roller around which the scroll is rolled.  When rolled up, the scrolls are secured with a braided silk cord and can be safely carried, placed on shelves, or stored in a [[lacquerware]] box. Handscrolls range in size, averaging 30 centimeters (1 ft.) in height and 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 ft.) in length.  A normal story covers one to three scrolls.

[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|320px|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding [[ Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol ships]] in 1281, from the ''[[Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba|Mōko shūrai ekotoba]]'' handscroll]]
''Emakimono'' are read by exposing an arms-length of the scroll at a time, from right to left, as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is written.  It was common for there to be a written account of the story being illustrated either at the start of the scroll, or interspersed between the pictures.  It is expected that the person viewing the scroll will re-roll the scroll back in its original form, much as one is supposed to rewind [[video tape]] after viewing it.

''Emakimono'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[otoko-e]]'' (Men's pictures) and ''[[onna-e]]'' (Women's pictures) styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. ''Otoko-e'', on the other hand, often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] (1160), depicted in the painting "Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace" is a famous example of this style.

==Well known examples==
The most often discussed example of ''emakimono'' is the [[The Tale of Genji#Illustrated scroll|''Genji monogatari emaki'']] dating from about 1130.  This ''emaki'' illustrates [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s epic ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.  Written about the year 1000, the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death.  While only 15% of the original scrolls remain, the fragments are protected as [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasures]].

The ''[[Chōjū giga]]'' (Scroll of Frolicking Animals) is unusual in its own medium, as it does not contain any text, only pictures.  It depicts scenes of animals in amusing scenes, analogizing Japanese society in the 12th century.

==Characteristics==
According to his creator, Entoman is the [[incarnation]] of [[Sigmund Freud|Siegmund Freud's]] [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]&lt;ref&gt;Carolin Fischer (February 1, 2010): "Entoman powered by Comicstars", Retrieved 2010-09-23, http://www.openpr.de/news/392911/Entoman-powered-by-Comicstars.html&lt;/ref&gt;, which means that he does everything he wants without being bound by his conscience. Furthermore, Entoman often shows very crude forms of brutality but also high intelligence and even childish behavior. His only weakness may be his desire for [[ice cream]].

'''Flip Flap''' is a [[solar powered]] toy that resembles a plant.

The small solar panel powers two leaves that bounce up and down continuously until the light source to the solar panel is stopped. The leaves can be stopped from bouncing by a switch on the underside of the device.

The Flip Flap has a large cult following in [[Japan]], but the popularity of the ornamental gadget is growing in the UK being marketed under the [[Tomy]] brand. Flip Flaps come in different models like the "Q" (which is round) and "F" (which has the shape of a flower pot). The big Flip Flaps (depends on the number) usually have three movements. Once you turn it on, the leaves begin to move up and down. If you tap one of the leaves, it shall begin to move seesaw to the direction in which the leaf was tapped.

As with other Tomy manufactured solar powered toys, there are fake Flip Flaps being sold in stores. These are often cheaply made in China and are limited to only an up-and-down motion, and are incapable of the 3 different movements characteristic of authentic Flip Flaps. The fake and real versions look extremely similar, but consumers can differentiate between the two by looking for the Tomy logo, almost entirely Japanese characters on the box (limited English), and dark green leaves (fake Flip Flaps have light green leaves, as opposed to the darker, real ones of slightly better quality). Other Flip Flap knockoffs are sold that are solely inspired by Flip Flaps, but not directly based on Flip Flaps, as they are sold in very different packaging than the authentic ones and have flowers that look different.

According to the EU patent database,&lt;ref&gt;http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?adjacent=true&amp;KC=A&amp;date=20090128&amp;NR=101352268A&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=CN&amp;FT=D&lt;/ref&gt; the patent was copied by a small Chinese company called "SHENZHEN LONGGANG PINGHU TENGY". It seems that Tomy has sold the licence to market this product as "Flip Flap" in EU and the Chinese company infringed the copyright. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29009">[[Combinatorial game theory]] has several ways of [[Computational complexity theory|measuring]] '''game [[complexity]]'''. This article describes five of them: state-space complexity, game tree size, decision complexity, game-tree complexity, and computational complexity.

==Measures of game complexity==

=== State-space complexity ===
The '''state-space complexity''' of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.&lt;ref name="Allis1994"/&gt;

When this is too hard to calculate, an [[upper bound]] can often be computed by including illegal positions or positions that can never arise in the course of a game.

=== Game tree size ===
The '''game tree size''' is the total number of possible games that can be played: the number of leaf nodes in the [[game tree]] rooted at the game's initial position.

The game tree is typically vastly larger than the state space because the same positions can occur in many games by making moves in a different order (for example, in a [[tic-tac-toe]] game with two X and one O on the board, this position could have been reached in two different ways depending on where the first X was placed). An upper bound for the size of the game tree can sometimes be computed by simplifying the game in a way that only increases the size of the game tree (for example, by allowing illegal moves) until it becomes tractable.

However, for games where the number of moves is not limited (for example by the size of the board, or by a rule about repetition of position) the game tree is infinite.

=== Decision trees ===
The next two measures use the idea of a ''[[decision tree]]'', which is a subtree of the game tree, with each position labelled with "player A wins", "player B wins" or "drawn", if that position can be proved to have that value (assuming best play by both sides) by examining only other positions in the graph.  (Terminal positions can be labelled directly; a position with player A to move can be labelled "player A wins" if any successor position is a win for A, or labelled "player B wins" if all successor positions are wins for B, or labelled "draw" if all successor positions are either drawn or wins for B.  And correspondingly for positions with B to move.)

==== Decision complexity ====
'''Decision complexity''' of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.

==== Game-tree complexity ====
The '''game-tree complexity''' of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest ''full-width'' decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.&lt;ref name="Allis1994"/&gt; A full-width tree includes all nodes at each depth.

This is an estimate of the number of positions one would have to evaluate in a [[minimax]] search to determine the value of the initial position.

It is hard even to estimate the game-tree complexity, but for some games a reasonable lower bound can be given by raising the game's average [[branching factor]] to the power of the number of [[Ply (chess)|plies]] in an average game, or:

&lt;math&gt;GTC \geq b^d&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Computational complexity ===
The '''[[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]''' of a game describes the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large, expressed in [[big O notation]] or as membership in a [[complexity class]]. This concept doesn't apply to particular games, but rather to games that have been [[generalized game|generalized]] so they can be made arbitrarily large, typically by playing them on an ''n''-by-''n'' board. (From the point of view of computational complexity a game on a fixed size of board is a finite problem that can be solved in O(1), for example by a look-up table from positions to the best move in each position.)

The asymptotic complexity is defined by the most efficient (in terms of whatever [[computational resource]] one is considering) algorithm for solving the game; the most common complexity measure ([[computation time]]) is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexities of each individual algorithm for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of [[DSPACE|space]] or [[computer memory]] used by the computation. It is not obvious that there is any lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be [[PSPACE-hard]], and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).
* The [[depth-first search|depth-first]] [[minimax strategy]] will use [[computation time]] proportional to game's tree-complexity, since it must explore the whole tree, and an amount of memory polynomial in the logarithm of the tree-complexity, since the algorithm must always store one node of the tree at each possible move-depth, and the number of nodes at the highest move-depth is precisely the tree-complexity.
* [[Backward induction]] will use both memory and time proportional to the state-space complexity as it must compute and record the correct move for each possible position.

==Example: tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses)==
For [[tic-tac-toe]], a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,683. (There are three states for each cell and nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478. And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.

A simple upper bound for the size of the game tree is 9! = 362,880. (There are nine positions for the first move, eight for the second, and so on.) This includes illegal games that continue after one side has won. A more careful count gives 255,168 possible games. When rotations and reflections of positions are considered the same, there are only 26,830 possible games.

The computational complexity of tic-tac-toe depends on how it is [[generalized game|generalized]]. A natural generalization is to [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]]: played on an ''m'' by ''n'' board with winner being the first player to get ''k'' in a row. It is immediately clear that this game can be solved in [[DSPACE]](''mn'') by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class [[PSPACE]]. With some more work it can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref name="Reisch1980"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stefan Reisch | title = Gobang ist PSPACE-vollständig (Gobang is PSPACE-complete) | journal = Acta Informatica | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | year = 1980 | doi=10.1007/bf00288536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complexities of some well-known games==
Due to the large size of game complexities, this table gives the ceiling of their [[logarithm]] to base 10.  (In other words, the number of digits).  All of the following numbers should be considered with caution: seemingly-minor changes to the rules of a game can change the numbers (which are often rough estimates anyway) by tremendous factors, which might easily be much greater than the numbers shown.

'''Games for Good''' is a [[non-profit]] charitable organization which raises funds and products from within the entertainment industry and donates them to child-centric partners. Started in 1998 by a group of volunteers, GfG was led by industry veteran Lynne Killey.&lt;ref name="AVS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avsim.com/press/index.shtml |title=Games for Good Press Release |work=AVSIM |date=April 6, 2000 |accessdate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152415/http://www.avsim.com/press/index.shtml |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises money and requests that game publishers donate video and computer games to them for re-distribution to children's charities. It hosts dinners, silent auctions and parties.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.videogames.yahoo.com/news-1094121 |title=Games For Good Trying For $250,000 |work=Yahoo Games: News |author=[[IGN]] |date=April 6, 2000 |accessdate=13 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In just a few years, the small undertaking had grown too large for a volunteer staff to handle and the effort was left dormant. In the following years several other game industry charities took up the effort of supporting individual children's charities in meaningful and productive ways, but none utilizing the repository model of supporting other charities.

The IEMA ([[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association]]), the U.S. trade association which represents the game industry's leading retailers, began receiving in three finished copies of each and every computer game manufactured due to a royalty-free licensing agreement that the association has with publishers. That agreement standardized the PC game box - reducing it from the oversized software standard, down to the now double-thick DVD size that we're all used to - and also standardized the PC CD and PC DVD icons (the small black and white logos that indicate the platform the game is created for). The IEMA has been donating the games to children's hospitals and local area charities and schools when long-time friends Lynne Killey (the founder of GfG) and [[Hal Halpin]] (the president of the IEMA) decided to restart the organizations.

Now re-launched, Games for Good is being run by the IEMA's staff. In addition to asking game publishers and developers to provide the three finished copies of each PC game they make, GfG is also asking for them to commit to providing three finished copies of all games they create on all platforms AND to help them with sponsorship funds.

A '''Gang Show''' is a theatrical performance by members of [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guides]]. Some Gang Shows have leaders of [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guides]] on stage too. Leaders, youth members and parents help behind the scenes. The aim is, through performance, to empower young people to make a positive contribution to society. 

The production teams and cast (all volunteers) plan, write, compose, choreograph, build scenery and props, make costumes and rehearse for several months. A typical show requires 3 to 6 months of rehearsals. Every show does it differently, but every show has the same three priorities. 1. it is for the young people - 2. it is a public shop window on Scouting &amp; Guiding, and therefore a great PR opportunity - 3. If they are lucky, they will at least break even. 

Performance runs range from one day to two weeks, and tickets are available to the public. While a Gang Show is purely an amateur production, the costs can be similar to a professional production.

==Gang Show format==
The format is a [[revue]] or variety show; song, dance and short comedy sketches are the most common. The number of items varies between 12 and 25, some stand-alone, others a series of songs to a chosen theme or a running gag.

The format was created  by [[Ralph Reader]], the original producer, who wrote material including the signature tune, ''Crest of a Wave''. Other "[[Standard (music)|standards]]" Reader wrote include ''Strolling'', ''Great Great Game'', ''Gee, It's A Wonderful life'', ''A Touch of Silver'', ''Three Cheers'', ''Show Time'', ''Together'', ''These are the Times'' and ''The Scout Hymn''.

==History==
[[Image:Gang Show 75th Anniversary.png|thumb|right|Woven badge issued to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Gang Show productions]]
In 1931, Reader, a Rover Scout trying to make his mark in theatre in the USA and London, was asked to write a Scout-based variety show to raise money for a swimming pool at [[Downe Scout Activity Centre|Downe Scout Camp]] (now a [[Scout Activity Centre (The Scout Association)|Scout Association National Activity Centre]]). Rehearsals began under Reader's direction on 25 May 1932, his 29th birthday.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/hi2/glasgowgangshow/ralphhistory.html Ralph Reader tells the history of the Gang Show]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the show did not have a title, but during a rehearsal break, Reader recalled, he asked a cast member if everyone was ready, to which the response was "Aye, aye Skip, the gang's all here". The first production, ''The Gang's All Here'', ran between 30 October and 1 November 1932 at the [[Scala Theatre]] in central London.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The show was not a sell-out but enough was raised to fund the swimming pool and the show was well received. [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the founder of scouting, persuaded Reader to produce another show in 1933. This was ''The Gang Comes Back'' and ran for a week.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Reader continued to write and produce the London Gang Show. In 1934 the show became ''The Gang Show'' and ''Crest of a Wave'' was performed for the first time, becoming over the years the anthem.

In 1937 the London show became the first amateur production to have a [[Royal Command Performance]] (an honour repeated in 1957 and 1964). A feature film called [[The Gang Show (1937 film)|The Gang Show]], starring Ralph Reader and The Gang, premièred at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] in April the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/lyceummelvilles.html The Lyceum Theatre and the Melvilles]&lt;/ref&gt; and in New York in December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028916/ IMDb: The Gang Show (1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
[[Image:Cgs scarf.jpg|thumb|left|A typical show scarf – this one is from Cumberland Gang Show in Australia]]
When the Gang Show started in London in 1932, Reader organised the cast as a [[Scout Troop]]; an arrangement which persists only in a few shows now. Members of the first troop wanted an identifying feature, deciding on a red [[Scarf#Scarves as uniforms|scarf]] or necker. The red scarf has become a worldwide symbol, and to distinguish shows, an insignia in gold thread (UK: the initials GS in Reader's handwriting shot through with the show's name - AUS: usually a design related to the masks of comedy and tragedy and incorporating the show's name) is embroidered into the point of the scarf. Ralph Reader was originally called "The Holborn Rover" and was with the 4th Holborn Group whose scarf was half red and half green. Reader chose to have the gang show scarf red to be part of the 4th Holborn.

Members of shows in the United Kingdom used to only be allowed to wear the scarlet scarf if they were nationally recognised, i.e. they came up to prescribed minimum standards of performance and production. It is now worn by almost all Gang Shows, but shows still need to apply for National Recognition every 5 years in order to maintain standards.

In 1972, Reader founded the London Gang Show Fellowship so current and former members of the London show could keep in touch. Membership later expanded to anyone interested in Gang Show.

In 1958 Reader went to Chicago to produce and direct the first Gang Show in America.  He returned to Chicago next year to guide the second. Reader first went to Chicago in 1920 as a teenager and began his stage career there.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Council's 1959 Gang Show souvenir program.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glasgow Gang Show has, with few exceptions, run every year since April 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clydescouts.org.uk/spage-events_info-glasgow_gang_show.html Glasgow Gang Show&lt;/ref&gt; Peterborough Gang Show started in November 1937 and apart from the war years has run ever since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peterboroughgangshow.com/gangshowspast.html Peterborough Gang Show&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harpenden]] Gang Show has performed every year since 1949, making it the longest continuously running Gang Show in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hwgangshow.org.uk Harpenden Gang Show/&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn|date=January 2018}} &lt;!-- suggest only entries here for shows that started before 1950. If it gets long, reduce to shows started pre-war --&gt;

== Gang Show Spin Offs ==
In some countries an over 18 only show often referred to as a Bag Show are produced, often with a dinner and a more cabaret style and with more adult content such as risque jokes &amp; burlesque elements. This is done for Rover Scouts and Leaders.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In Melbourne, Australia the Show Times came out of the strong theater culture of the area. These are smaller than the local Gang Show originally pulling form a single district to produce a show. Currently there are 4 of these shows Whitehorse Showtime, South Metro Showtime, Camberwell&amp;nbsp;Showtime and Strzelecki Showtime. Because these showtimes are not Gangshows they do not have the red scarf instead choosing a different color such as Strzelecki Showtime's gold Scarf.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Signature tunes==

'''On the Crest of a Wave''' has become the signature tune throughout the world{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and is usually performed at the end. It may be sung as just the chorus (traditionally twice, the first time with gusto, the second part-quiet and staccato, part with gusto once more) but there are also two verses.

'''A Touch of Silver''' (sometimes referred to as "Silver on the Scarlet"), written by Reader and [[Brisbane Gang Show]] producer Hugh "Kirra" McKee, is the signature tune of the [[Brisbane Gang Show]] and may be sung by any show that has performed for at least 25 seasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16706">'''Gelotophobia''' is a [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] of being laughed at, a type of [[social phobia]]. While most people do not like being laughed at,&lt;ref name="Heyd1982"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Place of Laughter in Hobbes's Theory of Emotions |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=285–295  |date= April 1982  |first= David |last=Heyd |doi=10.2307/2709204 |jstor=2709204}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a sub-group of people that exceedingly fear it, and without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychiatry]], and has been studied intensively.

In his clinical observations, [[:de:Michael Titze|Dr. Michael Titze]]&lt;ref name=Titze&gt;Titze, M. (1996). "The Pinocchio Complex: Overcoming the fear of laughter". ''Humor &amp; Health Journal'' '''5''', 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; found that some of his patients seemed to be primarily worried about being laughed at. They tended to scan their environment for signs of laughter and ridicule. Furthermore, they reported that they had the impression of being ridiculous themselves. Additionally, Titze observed a specific movement pattern among them when they thought they were being laughed at—awkward, wooden movements that resembled those of wooden puppets. He described this state as "[[Pinocchio]]-syndrome". 

Two other behaviours related to laughter are [[gelotophilia]], the joy of being laughed at, and [[katagelasticism]], the joy of laughing at others.

== Causes and consequences ==

From the clinical observations a model of the causes and consequences of gelotophobia was drawn up&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W. (2004). "Gelotophobia: A useful new concept?" Paper presented at the 2004 Colloquium Series, Department of Psychology, [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], Berkeley US.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the condition could be studied scientifically. The model claims that gelotophobia can be caused by any one of three things at different stages of development: 

The putative causes of gelotophobia:
* In infancy: development of primary shame failure to develop an interpersonal bridge (e.g. unsupportive infant–caregiver interactions).  
* In childhood and youth: repeated traumatic experiences of not being taken seriously or being laughed at/ridiculed (e.g. [[bullying]]).
* In adulthood: intense traumatic experience of being laughed at or ridiculed (e.g. [[wikt:mockery|mockery]]).

The consequences of gelotophobia:
* Social withdrawal to avoid being ridiculed. 
* Appearing 'cold as ice'/humourless. 
* Psychosomatic disturbances, e.g. blushing, [[tension headache]], trembling, dizziness, sleep disturbances. 
* Demonstrating 'Pinocchio Syndrome:' clumsy, 'agelotic' face, 'wooden puppet' appearance. 
* Lack of liveliness, spontaneity, joy. 
* Inability to experience humour/laughter as relaxing and joyful social experiences. 
* Anger when being laughed at by other people (in some cases this results in violent attacks on the people who were laughing).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-27323470 "Gelotophobia: living a life in fear of laughter"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 26 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Later this model was revised and expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruch|first=Willibald|last2=Hofmann|first2=Jennifer|last3=Platt|first3=Tracey|last4=Proyer|first4=René|date=2014|title=The state-of-the art in gelotophobia research: A review and some theoretical extensions|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/humr.2014.27.issue-1/humor-2013-0046/humor-2013-0046.xml|journal=Humor|volume=27|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/humor-2013-0046|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and outlook ==

Here is a quick checklist of gelotophobic behaviours which suggest that people are gelotophobic:
* They avoid social situations to avoid being laughed at or ridiculed. 
* They worry that people think they do not engage with them in a warm, friendly way, or think they are humourless. 
* They struggle to know what to say to people in a 'natural'  way. 
* They have low [[self-esteem]] due to feeling incompetent in social situations. 
* When people are talking and laughing, they feel their body getting tense, which then makes their movements appear wooden and stiff rather than being relaxed and natural. 
* They think they are not a lively person, are not spontaneous, and do not experience many joyful moments in their daily life. 
* They worry that they look ridiculous to others. 

Anyone who displays or experiences at least half of these characteristics may be gelotophobic. Since laughter is used as an integral part of communication and how people form and maintain relationships, it is natural to see how those who tend to be gelotophobic will find that their [[social interaction]]s are seriously affected.

Usually laughter is contagious and leads to positive emotions such as exhilaration and joy, yet no one likes to be laughed at or made fun of. Most people dislike being laughed at to some degree and gelotophobia can range from having no fear at all, to borderline, to pronounced or extreme gelotophobia.

== Assessment ==

There is a fifteen-item questionnaire for the subjective assessment of gelotophobia, e.g. the GELOPH&lt;15&gt;. This questionnaire has been used to show that gelotophobia exists, to varying degrees, in a normal population.&lt;ref name=Ruch2008&gt;Ruch, W., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2008). "[http://www.reference-global.com/toc/humr/21/1 The fear of being laughed at: Individual and group differences in gelotophobia]". ''[[Humor (journal)|Humor]]'', '''21'''(1), 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found on every continent and has, so far, had samples taken from 72 countries and the GELOPH&lt;15&gt; has been translated into over 42 different languages. 

Different countries vary in the number of people within the population, who are gelotophobes.&lt;ref name="Proyer &amp; Ruch 2009"&gt;Proyer, R.T., Ruch, W., Ali, N.S., Al-Olimat, H.S., Andualem Adal, T., Aziz Ansari S et al. (2009). "Breaking ground in cross-cultural research on the fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia): multi-national study involving 73 countries". ''Humor'', '''22''', 253-279.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist Christie Davies predicts a higher prevalence of gelotophobia in hierarchically organized societies where the main means of social control is shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Christie|date=2009-01-01|title=Humor theory and the fear of being laughed at|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/humr.2009.22.issue-1-2/humr.2009.003/humr.2009.003.xml|journal=Humor|volume=22|issue=1-2|doi=10.1515/humr.2009.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into gelotophobia using the GELOPH scales shows that empirically, the condition exists outside of people who seek therapy due to experiencing a problematic fear of being laughed at. In the first studies, gelotophobes were distinguished from other people with shame-based problems and non-shame based neurotics and samples of a normal population.&lt;ref name=Ruch2008/&gt; Basically, this means that even though gelotophobia shares similar problems,  high scores were also found for these criteria in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and Cluster A personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Elisabeth M.|last2=Schulter|first2=Günter|last3=Freudenthaler|first3=H.

The fear of being laughed at has also been studied among children and adolescents using modifications of these diagnostic instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proyer|first=René T.|last2=Meier|first2=Lukas E.|last3=Platt|first3=Tracey|last4=Ruch|first4=Willibald|date=2013-05-03|title=Dealing with laughter and ridicule in adolescence: relations with bullying and emotional responses|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-013-9221-y|journal=Social Psychology of Education|volume=16|issue=3|pages=399–420|doi=10.1007/s11218-013-9221-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotions ==

Although at face value the emotions relating to gelotophobia would be predominantly fear, there is a distinct interplay with three dominant emotions:&lt;ref name="Platt, T. 2009"&gt;Platt, T. &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "The emotions of gelotophobes: Shameful, fearful and joyless?" ''Humor'', '''22''', 91-110.&lt;/ref&gt; low levels of joy,  high levels of fear, and high levels of shame. More importantly, where shame in a typical week exceeds joy, gelotophobia is more likely to develop.&lt;ref name="Platt, T. 2009"/&gt; Gelotophobes say that they are bad at regulating their emotions, and they more easily pick up the negative moods of other people. They also suppress expression of their emotions and do not share their feelings readily with others.&lt;ref&gt;Papousek, I., Ruch, W., Freudenthaler, H. H., Kogler, E., Lang, B., &amp; Schulter, G. (2009). "Gelotophobia, emotion-related skills and responses to the affective states of others". ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]'', '''47''', 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perception and personality ==

Gelotophobes do not have the ability to understand the difference between playful forms of humorous interactions such as teasing, and crueller forms such as ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=Tracey. 
 |last=Platt 
 |date=May 2008 
 |title=Emotional responses to ridicule and teasing: Should gelotophobes react differently? 
 |journal=Humor
 |volume=21 
 |issue=2 
 |pages=105–128 
 |doi=10.1515/HUMOR.2008.005 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even if someone is trying to be friendly and playful, a gelotophobe will feel apprehensive and mistake the interaction for ridicule. It can also mean that people may feel they are being bullied when in fact they are not.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, T., Proyer, R.T. &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "[http://www.psychologie-aktuell.com/fileadmin/download/PschologyScience/2-2009/03_Platt.pdf Gelotophobia and bullying: The assessment of the fear of being laughed at and its application among bullying victims]". ''Psychology Science Quarterly'', 5,135-147.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gelotophobes are often located in both the [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]] PEN and the [[Five factor model|Big Five]] models of personality. Gelotophobia correlates highly with introversion and [[neuroticism]], and on older P-scales, gelotophobes score higher in psychoticism.&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2009). "Who Fears Being Laughed at? The Location of Gelotophobes in the Eysenckian PEN-model of Personality". ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''46'''(5-6), 627-630.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensional assessment of personality pathology, a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] personality disorder instrument, showed that those with a fear of being laughed at tend to be socially avoidant and submissive, as well as having identity problems. Social withdrawal and suspiciousness most frequently predicted gelotophobia.

Paul Lewis (Boston College, US) speculated whether political gelotophobia might affect elections in the US ("The twin fears of being effectively mocked or ineffective in mocking others [too harsh, blunt, tasteless] led candidates to aggressive and proactive strategies [going on TV to show they can take a joke, be funny—anything to avoid being rendered pathetically ridiculous or inappropriately derisive]") [p.&amp;nbsp;42, conference abstract from the 2009 conference of the International Society for Humor Studies [http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ ISHS] in Long Beach, California];&lt;ref name ="lewisp"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lewis, P.|title="Partisan gelotophobia and preemptive humor strategies". &lt;small&gt;Paper presented at the 21st Annual Conference of the International Society for Humor Studies, Long Beach, CA.&lt;/small&gt;|url=http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/english/faculty/facalpha/lewis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Christie Davies]], who is also president of the ISHS,  comments satirically on the results of recent elections in the UK. He noticed that losers in those elections were frequently bald—"To be bald is to suffer from gelotophobia, to fear being laughed at; to fear being laughed at is to fear disorder; to fear disorder is to embrace absolutism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001414.php Socialaffairsunit.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths, intelligence and humour ability ==

A number of tests show that gelotophobes often underestimate their own potential and achievements. Gelotophobes tend to see themselves as less [[virtue|virtuous]] than people who know them.&lt;ref name="Proyer &amp; Ruch 2009"/&gt; Similarly, in an intelligence study, gelotophobes consistently underestimated their intellectual performance by as much as 6 [[IQ]] points.&lt;ref name="Proyer &amp; Ruch 2009a"&gt;Proyer, R. T., &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "How virtuous are gelotophobes? Self- and Peer-reported character strengths among those who fear being laughed at". ''Humor'', '''22''', 145-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelotophobes have a different experience of laughter: it does not lift their mood or make them more cheerful. They personally characterise their own humour as being inept, yet once again, tests show that they are no different from other people at making witty remarks and humour.&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W., Beermann, U., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2009). "Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?" ''Humor'', '''22''', 111-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gertrude Stein''' (February 3, 1874 – July 27, 1946) was an American novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector. Born in the [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and raised in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], Stein moved to [[Paris]] in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]], where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Henri Matisse]], would meet.&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Extravagant Crowd: Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas |access-date=October 16, 2012 |url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/cvvpw/gallery/steintoklas1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'', written in the voice of [[Alice B. Toklas]], her [[life partner]] and an American-born member of the [[avant-garde|Parisian avant-garde]]. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Stein Salon Was The First Museum of Modern Art |access-date=October 13, 2012 |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-salon.html |last=Mellow |first=James R. |work=New York Times |date=May 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two quotes from her works have become widely known: "[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose]&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[there is no there there]]", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of [[Oakland, California]].

Her books include ''Q.E.D.'' (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends, ''Fernhurst'', a fictional story about a [[love triangle]], ''[[Three Lives]]'' (1905–06), and ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1902–1911). In ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'' (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

Her activities during [[World War II]] have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in [[Nazi]]-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful [[Vichy government]] official and Nazi collaborator [[Bernard Faÿ]]. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader [[Marshal Pétain]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some have argued that certain accounts of Stein's wartime activities have amounted to a "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7643746"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/why-the-witch-hunt-against-gertrude-stein |title=Why the Witch-Hunt Against Gertrude Stein? |work=tikkun.org |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |first1=Renate |last1=Stendhal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424220426/http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/why-the-witch-hunt-against-gertrude-stein |archivedate=April 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Stein was three years old, she and her family moved to [[Vienna]], and then Paris. Accompanied by governesses and tutors, the Steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of European history and life.&lt;ref name="Crimson" /&gt; After a year-long sojourn abroad, they returned to America in 1878, settling in [[Oakland, California]], where her father became director of [[San Francisco]]'s street car lines, the [[Market Street Railway (1893–1944)|Market Street Railway]], in an era when public transportation was a privately owned enterprise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/an-eye-for-genius-the-collections-of-gertrude-and-leo-stein-6210565/ |work=Smithsonian Magazine |last=Lubow |first=Arthur |title=An Eye for Genius: The Collections of Gertrude and Leo Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein attended [[Temple Sinai (Oakland, California)|First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland]]'s Sabbath school.&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum21&gt;[[#Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum (1987)]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; During their residence in Oakland, they lived for four years on a ten-acre lot, and Stein built many memories of California there. She would often go on excursions with her brother, Leo, with whom she developed a close relationship. Stein found formal schooling in Oakland unstimulating, but she read often: [[Shakespeare]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], [[Robert Burns|Burns]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], and more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When Stein was 14 years old, her mother died. Three years later, her father died as well. Stein's eldest brother, Michael Stein, then took over the family business holdings and in 1892 arranged for Gertrude and another sister, Bertha, to live with their mother's family in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;25–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Here she lived with her uncle [[David Bachrach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=895}} |date=2008-11-21| title = David Bachrach House, Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1877 had married Gertrude's maternal aunt, Fanny Keyser.

In Baltimore, Stein met [[Claribel Cone|Claribel]] and [[Etta Cone]], who held Saturday evening [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] that she would later emulate in Paris. The Cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that Stein would replicate in her relationship with [[Alice B. Toklas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Radcliffe===
Stein attended [[Radcliffe College]],&lt;ref name=Crimson&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1959/2/18/gertrude-stein-at-radcliffe-most-brilliant/ |title=Gertrude Stein at Radcliffe: Most Brilliant Women Student |work=The Harvard Crimson |language=en |access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; then an annex of [[Harvard University]], from 1893 to 1897 and was a student of psychologist [[William James]]. With James's supervision, Stein and another student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on ''normal motor automatism'', a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking.

These experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]", a psychological theory often attributed to James and the style of modernist authors [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[James Joyce]]. In 1934, behavioral psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] interpreted Stein's difficult poem ''Tender Buttons'' as an example of ''normal motor automatism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Has Gertrude Stein a Secret?" ''Cumulative Record'', 3rd ed. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972, 359–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter Stein wrote during the 1930s, she explained that she never accepted the theory of [[automatic writing]]: "[T]here can be automatic movements, but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meyer|Meyer (2001)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She did publish an article in a psychological journal on "spontaneous automatic writing" while at Radcliffe, but "the unconscious and the intuition (even when James himself wrote about them) never concerned her."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Radcliffe, she began a lifelong friendship with Mabel Foote Weeks, whose correspondence traces much of the progression of Stein's life. In 1897, Stein spent the summer in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], studying embryology at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/S02/annals.html | title = Hopkins Medical News | contribution = The Unknown Gertrude}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) [[magna cum laude]] from Radcliffe in 1898.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Johns Hopkins School of Medicine===
William James, who had become a committed mentor to Stein at Radcliffe, recognizing her intellectual potential, and declaring her his "most brilliant woman student", encouraged Stein to enroll in medical school. Although Stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine, she enrolled at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1897.  In her fourth year, Stein failed an important course, lost interest, and left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ultimately, medical school had bored her, and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies, but taking long walks and attending the opera.&lt;ref name="Crimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/gertrude-stein |title=Gertrude Stein 1874–1846 |access-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein's tenure at Johns Hopkins was marked by challenge and stress. Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''[[Things As They Are]]'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as "Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's "controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Asked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled "The Value of College Education for Women", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:

{{quote|"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered. [This economic dependence caused her to become] oversexed...adapting herself to the abnormal sex desire of the male...and becoming a creature that should have been first a human being and then a woman into one that is a woman first and always."|source=&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

While a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still naïve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her "erotic awakening". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"/&gt;

==Art collection==
[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|Gertrude and Leo Stein bought [[Henri Matisse]]'s, ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905, a portrait of the artist's wife, Amelia, now in the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]

[[File:Leo, Gertrude, Michael Stein.jpg|thumb|Leo, Gertrude, and Michael Stein]]
From 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the [[Luxembourg Garden]] on the [[Left Bank]] of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at [[27 rue de Fleurus]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.

The gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture manufactured in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Leo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time. The art historian and collector [[Bernard Berenson]] hosted Gertrude and Leo in his English country house in 1902, facilitating their introduction to [[Paul Cézanne]] and the dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 43–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Vollard was heavily involved in the Cézanne art market, and he was the first important contact in the Paris art world for both Leo and Gertrude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The joint collection of Gertrude and Leo Stein began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of 8,000 francs. They spent this at [[Ambroise Vollard|Vollard]]'s Gallery, buying [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s ''Sunflowers''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gauguin | title = Sunflowers | url = http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/poc?urile=wcm:path%3A%2FKAMIS_EN%2FWorks%2Bof%2BArt%2F01.%2BPaintings%2F28188 | publisher = The Hermitage Museum | format = painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Three Tahitians'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Three Tahitians | url = http://art.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4942/three-tahitians-1899 | publisher = National Galleries | place = Scotland, UK | last = Gauguin | format = painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne's ''Bathers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cézanne | title = Bathers | url = http://collection.artbma.org/emuseum/start | publisher = Cone Collection | format = painting | series = Baltimore holdings}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoirs]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collection increased and the walls at Rue de Fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.132.81.65/PATREQIMGX01/size3/D1201/1063829.jpg Gertrude seated near sculpture and Cézanne's ''Bathers'' (1903–04)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080805084330/http://130.132.81.65/PATREQIMGX01/size3/D1201/1063829.jpg |date=2008-08-05 }}: The [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] catalog dates photo at 1905 ([[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 53) and places ''Bathers'' (1895) in the [http://artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222011339/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=2007-12-22 }}, [[Baltimore]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "the first half of 1905" the Steins acquired [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''Portrait of Mme Cézanne'' and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s ''Perseus and Andromeda''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 26. The Delacroix painting is now in the Cone Collection, Baltimore. (Dorothy Kosinski et al., Matisse: Painter as Sculptor, p. 38 (Yale Univ. Press 2007))&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the opening of the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 (on October 18, 1905), the Steins acquired Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat''&lt;ref&gt;This painting is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.&lt;ref&gt;Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8. The painting is in a private collection, but was displayed in a 2003 Matisse/Picasso exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry McBride (art critic)|Henry McBride]] (art critic for the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'') did much for Stein's reputation in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: "[I]n proportion to its size and quality... [it is] just about the most potent of any that I have ever heard of in history."&lt;ref name="Mellow_193"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; McBride also made the observation that Gertrude "collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off."&lt;ref name="Mellow_193"/&gt;

By early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein's studio had many paintings by [[Henri Manguin]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art, 1970, pp. 88–89 provides detailed black-and-white images of the paintings on the wall.&lt;/ref&gt; Their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in Paris, and to which they contributed, either by lending their art, or by patronizing the featured artists.&lt;ref&gt;The first, the Paris Autumn Salon of 1905, introduced [[Fauvism]] to the Paris art public, to some shock and political cartooning. The second, the [[Armory Show]] of 1913, in New York City, introduced Modern Art to the United States art public, accompanied by similar public disparagement.&lt;/ref&gt; The Steins' elder brother, Michael, and sister-in-law Sarah (Sally) acquired a large number of [[Henri Matisse]] paintings; Gertrude's friends from Baltimore, [[Claribel Cone|Claribel]] and [[Etta Cone]], collected similarly, eventually donating their art collection, virtually intact, to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |title=Cone Collection |publisher=Baltimore Museum of Art |date=1903-06-26 |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Where [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and [[Sarah Stein]] emphasized [[Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1914 Leo relocated to [[Settignano|Settignano, Italy, near Florence]], and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:

{{quote |The Cézanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace. The Picasso landscape is not important in any such sense. We are, as it seems to me on the whole, both so well off now that we needn't repine. The Cézannes had to be divided. I am willing to leave you the Picasso oeuvre, as you left me the Renoir, and you can have everything except that. I want to keep the few drawings that I have. This leaves no string for me, it is financially equable either way for estimates are only rough &amp; ready methods, &amp; I'm afraid you'll have to look upon the loss of the apples as an act of God. I have been anxious above all things that each should have in reason all that he wanted, and just as I was glad that Renoir was sufficiently indifferent to you so that you were ready to give them up, so I am glad that Pablo is sufficiently indifferent to me that I am willing to let you have all you want of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 207–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An image of "the Cézanne apples" appears in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], plate 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leo departed with sixteen Renoirs, and relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to Cézanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a Cézanne painting of "5 apples".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after [[World War I]], and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-family.html ''The Family Knew What It Liked'']. ''The New York Times'', 3 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
After Stein's and Leo's households separated in 1914, she continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to [[Cubism]], a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and [[Juan Gris]], most of her other pictures having been sold.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, "[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th century painting in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family |author=Linda Wagner-Martin |page=67 |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1995 |asin=B002MRKVDU |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2uyupUrgNkC&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of [[Juan Gris]], [[André Masson]], and Sir [[Francis Cyril Rose|Francis Rose]]. In 1932, Stein asserted: "painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter [[Francisco Riba Rovira]] (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.

The only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein.

==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==
[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at 27 rue de Fleurus]]
The gatherings in the Stein home "brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art". Dedicated attendees included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Francis Cyril Rose]], [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], [[René Crevel]], [[Élisabeth de Gramont]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Claribel Cone]], [[Mildred Aldrich]], [[Jane Peterson]], [[Carl Van Vechten]] and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"/&gt; Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors. It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of Cézanne: "Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[André Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway "yellow" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.&lt;ref name="Meyers1"&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stein has been credited with inventing the term "[[Lost Generation]]" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.

==Literary style==
[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]
Stein's writing can be placed in three categories: "hermetic" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: "[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]"; "Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], "There is no there there"; and "The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable."

These [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or "portraits", were designed to evoke "the excitingness of pure being" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on "[[automatic writing]]" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Though Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[Cézanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: "the whole field of the canvas is important" (p.&amp;nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, "Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other." It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: "The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality."

Her use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the "bottom nature" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as "As I was saying" and "There will be now a history of her." Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with "too much association". Social judgement is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Stein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes "play" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: "rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must "''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.

Several of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with "a" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. "a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose."

When someone commented that Stein didn't look like her portrait, Picasso replied, "She will".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern_art/gertrude_stein/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=210008443&amp;collID=21&amp;vw=0 | title = Portrait of Gertrude Stein | publisher = Metropolitan Museum | accessdate = November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein wrote "[[If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso]]" in response to the painting. ]]

While living in Paris, Stein began submitting her writing for publication. Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.

Mabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.&lt;ref name="MoMA"/&gt; Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, "the first avant-garde art exhibition in America".&lt;ref name="MoMA"/&gt;

In addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in "Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.&lt;ref name="Mellow_170"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in "Speculations":

{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: "It ''is'' a fine pattern!" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.&lt;ref name="Mellow_170"/&gt;}}

Stein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was "Papa Woojums", and Stein, "Baby Woojums". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"/&gt;

===America (1934–1935)===
In October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Stein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that "Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures." Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her "to stutter over words and phrases". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the "musicality of her language".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

In Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In [[Beverly Hills]], California, she visited actor and filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]] who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from [[Random House]], who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaillant|Jaillant (2015)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote after Stein's return to Paris: "No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

===Books===

====''Q.E.D''.====
Stein completed ''Q.E.D.'', her first novel, on October 24, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 53–58.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest [[coming out]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Gertrude Stein|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;currPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;mode=view&amp;catId=&amp;u=loym48904&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1602000898&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=true|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and [[Mary Bookstaver]], and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="Blackmer 1995 pp. 681"&gt;[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]], pp. 681–6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This story is discussed more completely later in this article in the section on "Lesbian relationships". --&gt;

====''Fernhurst'' (1904)====
In 1904 Stein began ''Fernhurst'', a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean ([[M. Carey Thomas]]), a faculty member from [[Bryn Mawr College]] (Mary Gwinn) and a Harvard graduate (Alfred Hodder).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 65–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Mellow asserts that ''Fernhurst'' "is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing".&lt;ref name="Mellow_67"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], 67.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes some commentary that Gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the "fateful twenty-ninth year"&lt;ref name = "Mellow_67"/&gt; during which:

{{quote |All the forces that have been engaged through the years of childhood, adolescence and youth in confused and ferocious combat range themselves in ordered ranks (and during which) the straight and narrow gateway of maturity, and life which was all uproar and confusion narrows down to form and purpose, and we exchange a great dim possibility for a small hard reality.

Also in our American life where there is no coercion in custom and it is our right to change our vocation so often as we have desire and opportunity, it is a common experience that our youth extends through the whole first twenty-nine years of our life and it is not till we reach thirty that we find at last that vocation for which we feel ourselves fit and to which we willingly devote continued labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 67–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mellow observes that, in 1904, 30-year-old Gertrude "had evidently determined that the 'small hard reality' of her life would be writing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Three Lives'' (1905–1906)====
Stein attributed the inception of ''[[Three Lives]]'' to the inspiration she received from a portrait [[Cézanne]] had painted of his wife and which was in the Stein collection. She credited this as a [[Revelation|revelatory moment]] in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:

{{cquote| that the stylistic method of ''(Three Lives)'' had been influenced by the Cézanne portrait under which she sat writing. The portrait of Madame Cézanne is one of the monumental examples of the artist's method, each exacting, carefully negotiated plane—from the suave reds of the armchair and the gray blues of the sitter's jacket to the vaguely figured wallpaper of the background—having been structured into existence, seeming to fix the subject for all eternity. So it was with Gertrude's repetitive sentences, each one building up, phrase by phrase, the substance of her characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She began ''Three Lives'' during the spring of 1905 and finished it the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Making of Americans'' (1902–1911)====
Gertrude Stein stated the date for her writing of ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' was 1906–8. Her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in 1902 and did not end until 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 114–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein compared her work to [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and to [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. Her critics were less enthusiastic about it.&lt;ref name="Mellow 1974, p. 122"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein wrote the bulk of the novel between 1903 and 1911, and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, George B. ''Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans: Repetition and the Emergence of Modernism''. Washington, D.C.: Peter Lang, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until 1924 when, at the urging of [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Ford Madox Ford]] agreed to publish excerpts in the ''[[transatlantic review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, Lawrence. Book Review of ''The Making of Americans''. ''Modernism/Modernity'' 4.2 (1997): 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the Paris-based Contact Press published a limited run of the novel consisting of 500 copies. A much-abridged edition was published by [[Harcourt Brace]] in 1934, but the full version remained out of print until [[Something Else Press]] republished it in 1966. In 1995, a new, definitive edition was published by [[Dalkey Archive Press]] with a foreword by [[William Gass]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Gertrude. ''The Making of Americans''. Normal, Illinois: Dalkey Archive Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude's ''Matisse'' and ''Picasso'' descriptive essays appeared in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s August, 1912 edition of ''[[Camera Work]]'', a special edition devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her very first publication.&lt;ref name="Kellner_266"&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this publication, Gertrude said, "[h]e was the first one that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one."&lt;ref name="Kellner_266"/&gt;

====Word Portraits (1908–1913)====
Stein's descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of Alice B. Toklas, "a little prose vignette, a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of ''[[The Making of Americans]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein's early efforts at word portraits are catalogued in {{harvtxt | Mellow | 1974 | pp = 129–37}} and under individual's names in Kellner, 1988. Matisse and Picasso were subjects of early essays,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 154–5, 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; later collected and published in ''Geography and Plays''{{Sfn | Stein | 1922}} and ''Portraits and Prayers''.{{Sfn | Stein | 1934}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], pp. 34–5, 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Matisse and Picasso portraits were reprinted in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her subjects included several ultimately famous personages, and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her Saturday salons at 27 Rue de Fleurus: "Ada" ([[Alice B. Toklas]]), "Two Women" (The [[Cone sisters]], [[Claribel Cone]] and [[Etta Cone]]), ''Miss Furr and Miss Skeene'' ([[Ethel Mars (artist)|Ethel Mars]] and [[Maud Hunt Squire]]), "Men" ([[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[Peter David Edstrom]], [[Maurice Sterne]]), "Matisse" (1909, [[Henri Matisse]]), "Picasso" (1909, [[Pablo Picasso]]), "Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia" (1911, [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]]), and "[[Guillaume Apollinaire]]" (1913).

====''Tender Buttons'' (1912)====
''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'' is the best known of Stein's "hermetic" works. It is a small book separated into three sections—"Food, Objects and Rooms", each containing prose under subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication in 1914 caused a great dispute between [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and Stein, because Mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press Gertrude selected.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"/&gt; Evans wrote Gertrude:

{{quote |Claire Marie Press... is absolutely third rate, &amp; in bad odor here, being called for the most part 'decadent" and Broadwayish and that sort of thing... I think it would be a pity to publish with [Claire Marie Press] ''if'' it will emphasize the idea in the opinion of the public, that there is something degenerate &amp; effete &amp; decadent about the whole of the cubist movement which they ''all'' connect you with, because, hang it all, as long as they don't understand a thing they think all sorts of things. My feeling in this is quite strong.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"/&gt;}}

Stein ignored Mabel's exhortations, and eventually Mabel, and published 1,000 copies of the book, in 1914. An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as ''Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition'' by [[City Lights Publishers]] in March 2014.

In an interview with [[:de:Robert Bartlett Haas|Robert Bartlett Haas]] in "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely "realistic" in the tradition of [[Gustave Flaubert]], stating the following: "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the ''reference'' of objects remained central to her work, although the ''representation'' of them had not.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|title=The Difference is Spreading: on Gertrude Stein|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|year=2000|accessdate=30 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011190719/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|archive-date=11 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Marjorie Perloff]] had said of Stein that "[u]nlike her contemporaries ([[T.S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]], [[Marianne Moore|Moore]]), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know."&lt;ref name="Perloff" /&gt;

==Alice B. Toklas==
Stein met her [[life partner]] [[Alice B. Toklas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Linzie | first = Anna | title = The True Story of Alice B. Toklas: A Study of Three Autobiographies | publisher = University of Iowa Press  | year = 2006 | pages = 1, 67, 146 | isbn = 978-0-87745-985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 8, 1907, on Toklas's first day in Paris, at Sarah and Michael Stein's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; On meeting Stein, Toklas wrote:

{{quote |She was a golden brown presence, burned by the Tuscan sun and with a golden glint in her warm brown hair. She was dressed in a warm brown corduroy suit. She wore a large round coral brooch and when she talked, very little, or laughed, a good deal, I thought her voice came from this brooch. It was unlike anyone else's voice—deep, full, velvety, like a great contralto's, like two voices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/toklas.htm |title=Alice B Toklas |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914184957/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/toklas.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon thereafter, Stein introduced Toklas to [[Pablo Picasso]] at his studio, where he was at work on ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''.

In 1908, they summered in [[Fiesole]], Italy, Toklas staying with [[Harriet Lane Levy]], the companion of her trip from the United States, and her housemate until Alice moved in with Stein and Leo in 1910. That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice's summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark's.&lt;ref name="Mellow 1974, p. 122"/&gt;

Toklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910. In an essay written at the time, Stein humorously discussed the complex efforts, involving much letter writing and Victorian niceties, to extricate Levy from Toklas's living arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Harriet", Stein considers Levy's nonexistent plans for the summer, following her nonexistent plans for the winter:

{{quote |She said she did not have any plans for the summer. No one was interested in this thing in whether she had any plans for the summer. That is not the complete history of this thing, some were interested in this thing in her not having any plans for the summer... Some who were not interested in her not having made plans for the summer were interested in her not having made plans for the following winter. She had not made plans for the summer and she had not made plans for the following winter... There was then coming to be the end of the summer and she was then not answering anything when any one asked her what were her plans for the winter.{{Sfn | Stein | 1934 | pp = 105–07}}}}

[[File:Gertrude Stein by Alvin Langdon Coburn.jpg|thumb|upright|Stein in 1913]]
During the early summer of 1914, Gertrude bought three paintings by [[Juan Gris]]: ''Roses'', ''Glass and Bottle'', and ''Book and Glasses''. Soon after she purchased them from [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 210–5.&lt;/ref&gt; When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.

With money acquired from the sale of Stein's last Matisse ''[[Woman with a Hat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://highway55.library.yale.edu/PHOTONEGIMG/screen/S373/s3737234.jpg | format = [[JPEG]] | title = Woman with a Hat | publisher = Yale Collection | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926051404/http://highway55.library.yale.edu/PHOTONEGIMG/screen/S373/s3737234.jpg | archivedate = 2007-09-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to her brother Michael, she and Toklas vacationed in Spain from May 1915 through the spring of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 218–6.&lt;/ref&gt; During their interlude in [[Majorca]], Spain, Gertrude continued her correspondence with [[Mildred Aldrich]] who kept her apprised of the War's progression, and eventually inspired Gertrude and Alice to return to France to join the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 225–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toklas and Stein returned to Paris in June 1916, and acquired a Ford automobile with the help of associates in the United States; Gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend [[William Edwards Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 226–7&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrude and Alice then volunteered to drive supplies to French hospitals, in the Ford they named ''Auntie'', "after Gertrude's aunt Pauline, 'who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered.'"

[[File:GertrudeStein JackHemingway Paris.jpg|thumb|Gertrude Stein with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s son, [[Jack Hemingway]] in 1924. Stein is credited with bringing the term "Lost Generation" into use.]]
During the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.'' She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rhône-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named "Basket" whose successor, "Basket II", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.

With the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Faÿ]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book "Wars I Have Seen" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Faÿ was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Faÿ's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: "Off We All Went To See Germany."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was "Baby Precious", in turn Stein was for Toklas, "Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle".&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation" /&gt;

===Lesbian relationships===
Stein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, "''Q.E.D.''" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested "passion in its many disguised forms". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.&lt;ref name="Blackmer 1995 pp. 681"/&gt;

Stein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/5/ Discursive departures: A reading paradigm affiliated with feminist, lesbian, aesthetic and queer practices (with reference to Woolf, Stein, and H.D.)]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt;

More positive affirmations of Stein's sexuality began with her relationship with [[Alice B. Toklas]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]] describes how Alice was Gertrude's "wife" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two "wives" to chat.&lt;ref name="Grahn"&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more affirming essay "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene" is one of the first [[lesbian literature|homosexual revelation stories]] to be published. The work, like ''Q.E.D.'', is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community,&lt;ref name="Grahn"/&gt; though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"&gt;[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains the word "[[gay]]" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word "gay" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them,&lt;ref name = "Blackmer" /&gt; and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line "Sometimes men are kissing" but is less well known.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

In ''[[Tender buttons: objects, food, rooms|Tender Buttons]]'' Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with "highly condensed layers of public and private meanings" created by wordplay including puns on the words "box", "cow", and in titles such as "tender buttons".&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw&lt;/ref&gt; quotation, "[[there is no there there]]" is also one of her most famous. It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). She wrote:

{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

...but not there, there is no there there. ... Ah Thirteenth Avenue was the same it was shabby and overgrown. ... Not of course the house, the house the big house and the big garden and the eucalyptus trees and the rose hedge naturally were not there any longer existing, what was the use ...

It is a funny thing about addresses where you live. When you live there you know it so well that it is like an identity a thing that is so much a thing that it could not ever be any other thing and then you live somewhere else and years later, the address that was so much an address that it was like your name and you said it as if it was not an address but something that was living and then years after you do not know what the address was and when you say it is not a name anymore but something you cannot remember. That is what makes your identity not a thing that exists but something you do or do not remember.}}

==Political views==
According to Janet Malcolm's contested account in ''Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice'', Stein was a vocal critic of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name="entertainment.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/biography_and_memoirs/article3121561.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Gertrude and Alice | first = Justin | last=Beplate | date=January 2, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Herbert |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2557/ |title=The Cubist Republican |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/books/ |accessdate=February 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some have stressed her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics,&lt;ref&gt;Joan Rettalack, ''Introduction to Stein Selections'', University of California Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-4711487"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringfictions.blogspot.com/2011/08/douglas-messerli-thirteen-ways-of.html |title=Douglas Messerli &amp;#124; 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Stone' (on Janet Malcolm's Two Lives) |work=exploringfictions.blogspot.com |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-29 |first=Douglas |last=Messerli |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424220237/http://exploringfictions.blogspot.com/2011/08/douglas-messerli-thirteen-ways-of.html |archivedate=April 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; her statements on immigration include sentiments that would be considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in ''The New York Times'' she stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;That is the reason why I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WARREN|first1=LANSING|title=Gertrude Stein Views Life and Politics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=May 6, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She publicly endorsed General [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and admired Vichy leader Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]].&lt;ref name = "entertainment.timesonline.co.uk" /&gt; Some have argued for a more nuanced view of Stein's collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modernism-modernity/v011/11.4will.html | publisher = JHU | work = Project MUSE | title = Modernism/modernity—Lost in Translation: Stein's Vichy Collaboration | date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/07/usa.comment | location=London | work= The Guardian | title= The ignoble Nobel | first= Tariq | last= Ali | date= December 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = LA review of books | last = Stendhal | first = Renate | date = December 17, 2011 | title = Was Gertrude Stein a collaborator? | url = http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=9&amp;fulltext=1 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120711173928/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=9&amp;fulltext=1 | archivedate = July 11, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.scene4.com/readersblog/2012/01/the_obscene_critic.html | title = The obscene critic | journal = Scene4 Magazine | first = Renate | last = Stendhal | format = web log | date = 2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]: "There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing."&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

==World War II activities==
While identified with the modernist movements in art and literature, Stein's political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas. She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Will |first=Barbara |journal=Humanities |title=The Strange Politics of Gertrude Stein |date=March–April 2012 |volume=33 |number=2 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/marchapril/feature/the-strange-politics-gertrude-stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |last=Herschthal |first=Eric |title=Gertrude Stein: Why Her Fascist Politics Matter |work=The Jewish Week |date=April 24, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno, ''"Courage to Be Courageous": The Last Works and Days of Gertrude Stein'', from ''The Continual Pilgrimage: American Writers in Paris, 1944–1960''Grove Presm 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Her last major work was the [[libretto]] of the feminist opera ''[[The Mother of Us All]]'' (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, ''Brewsie and Willie'' (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.

A compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful [[Vichy government]] official [[Bernard Faÿ]]. Stein had met Faÿ in 1926, and he became her "dearest friend during her life", according to Alice B. Toklas. Faÿ had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933–34 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Faÿ's influence was instrumental in avoiding [[Nazi]] confiscation of Stein's historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork, which throughout the war years was housed in Stein's Paris rue Christine apartment, under locked safeguard.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/why-wont-the-met-tell-the-whole-truth-about-gertrude-stein |last=Greenhouse |first=Emily |title=Why Won't The Met Tell The Whole Truth About Gertrude Stein |work=The New Yorker |date=June 8, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, at Faÿ's suggestion, Stein consented to translate into English some 180 pages of speeches made by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]. In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between [[George Washington]] and Pétain. She writes of the high esteem in which Pétain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler. Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein's translations were ultimately never published in the United States. [[Random House]] publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] had read the introduction Stein had written for the translations and been horrified by what she had produced.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/04/26/missionaries/ |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |title=Missionaries |work=The New York Review of Books |date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jewish, Stein collaborated with [[Vichy France]], a regime that deported more than 75,000 Jews to [[Nazi concentration camps]], of whom only 3 percent survived the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/met-gertrude-stein-collaborator_b_1467174.html |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |title=Suppressing Ugly Truths from Beautiful Art |work=The Huffington Post |date=May 21, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Stein wrote that Petain's policies were "really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary". This was Stein's contention in the year when the town of [[Culoz]], where she and Toklas resided, saw the removal of its Jewish children to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; It is difficult to say, however, how aware Stein was of these events. As she wrote in ''Wars I Have Seen'', "However near a war is it is always not very near. Even when it is here."&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein, ''Wars I Have Seen''. London: B.T. Batsford, 1945, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein had stopped translating Petain's speeches three years previously, in 1941.

Stein was able to condemn the Japanese attack at [[Pearl Harbor]] while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of Hitler as conqueror of Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Journalist Lanning Warren interviewed Stein in her Paris apartment in a piece published in ''The New York Times Magazine'' on May 6, 1934. Stein, seemingly ironically, proclaimed that Hitler merited the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

:"The Saxon element is always destined to be dominated. The Germans have no gift at organizing. They can only obey. And obedience is not organization. Organization comes from community of will as well as community of action. And in America our democracy has been based on community of will and effort.... I say Hitler ought to have the peace prize...because he is removing all elements of contest and struggle from Germany. By driving out the Jews and the democratic Left elements, he is driving out everything that conduces to activity. That means peace."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lansing Warren |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html |work=The New York Times |title=Gertrude Stein Views Life and Politics |date=May 6, 1934  |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that after the war Stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the Germans disobedience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/article/gertrude-stein-taunts-hitler-1934-and-1945 |title=Gertrude Stein taunts Hitler in 1934 and 1945 |publisher=Jacket2 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this 1934 Stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy.  In an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of Stein's wartime activity, a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal Jacket2.&lt;ref name="jacket2.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/feature/gertrude-steins-war-years-setting-record-straight |title=Gertrude Stein's war years: Setting the record straight |publisher=Jacket2 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How much of Stein's wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacket2.org"/&gt; She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. Accustomed to a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: "it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food." Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this at a time when Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Author [[Djuna Barnes]] provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, "Wars I Have Seen":

:"You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people. Her concerns at its highest pitch is a well-fed apprehension."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

Others have argued that some of the accounts of Stein's war time activities have amounted to a "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7643746"/&gt;

==Death==
Stein died on July 27, 1946 at the age of 72 after surgery for [[stomach cancer]] at the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Rowley, "Richard Wright: The Life and Times," p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].  She was interred in Paris in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unjourdeplusaparis.com/en/paris-essentiel/plan-du-cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise Plan du cimetiere du Pere Lachaise] (Accessed: 11 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Later Alice B. Toklas was buried alongside her.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 44876-44877). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt; According to the famous version of her last moments, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: "What is the answer?"  After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: "Then, there is no question!"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Z. Smith: see idem, "When the Bough Breaks," ''History of Religions'' 12/4 (May 1973): 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Her companion Toklas, however, has given two other versions of the encounter—neither of which agrees with the "canonical" version above.  Writing in the June 2005 edition of ''The New Yorker'', Janet Malcolm describes:
{{quote |On July 27, 1946, Stein was operated on for what proved to be inoperable stomach cancer and died before coming out of anesthesia.  In "What Is Remembered," Toklas wrote of the "troubled, confused and very uncertain" afternoon of the surgery. "I sat next to her and she said to me early in the afternoon, What is the answer? I was silent. In that case, she said, what is the question?" However, in a letter to Van Vechten ten years earlier, Toklas had written:
{{quote |About Baby's last words. She said upon waking from a sleep--What is the question. And I didn't answer thinking she was not completely awakened. Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}

Stein's biographers have naturally selected the superior "in that case what is the question?" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Janet, "Someone Says Yes to It," ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148&lt;/ref&gt;}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701075634/http://bryantpark.org/things-to-do/monuments.html There is a monument to Stein] on the Upper Terrace of [[Bryant Park]], [[New York City|New York]].

== Critical reception ==
[[Sherwood Anderson]] in his public introduction to Stein's 1922 publication of ''Geography and Plays'' wrote:
{{quote |For me the work of Gertrude Stein consists in a rebuilding, an entirely new recasting of life, in the city of words. Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}

In a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, "As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}"

Other critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;IX) defines "Steinese" as "gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation".

Composer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of "the drabbest and least significant phrases" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in "Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene" (1922), specifically: "[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday." He writes that the "effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.

[[James Thurber]] wrote:
{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem. Why Stein is not, finally, a good or helpful writer. There is no problem. It’s all affirmation. A rose is a rose is a rose.”''&lt;br&gt;[[Susan Sontag]], from Journals and Notebooks, 1964-1980.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag, 2012. P.398.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Author [[Katherine Ann Porter]] provided her own estimation of Stein's literary legacy: "Wise or silly or nothing at all, down everything goes on the page with an air of everything being equal, unimportant in itself important because it happened to her and she was writing about it."&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"&gt;Benstock, Shari, ''Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900–1940'', University of Texas Press, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0292790407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History Professor [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]], has written of Stein: "She was not a radical feminist. She was Jewish and anti-Semitic, lesbian and contemptuous of women, ignorant about economics and hostile to socialism."&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in 1923, eminent literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] presciently came to an evaluation similar to the one made by Katharine Ann Porter some twenty years later, after Stein's death. Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with

:"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&amp;nbsp;... Miss Stein no longer understands the conditions under which literary effects have to be produced&amp;nbsp;... There is sometimes genuine music in the most baffling of her works, but there are rarely any communicated emotions."&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879"&gt;Wilson, Edmund, "A Guide to Gertrude Stein", ''Vanity Fair'', September 1923, ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s &amp; 1930s'', Library of America, 2007, p. 878–879&lt;/ref&gt;

An elevated observer, perched high above everything below, he likened Stein to a self-conceived "[[Buddha]]...registering impressions like some august seismograph".&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879"/&gt;

Stein's literary output was a subject of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an "abomination". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of her alleged inability to communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required "to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength".&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"/&gt;

==Legacy and commemoration==
Stein has been the subject of many artistic works. 
Stein and Toklas merit their own line each in the song "Bosom Buddies" from the 1966 Broadway musical ''MAME'', based on the stage play ''Auntie Mame'', by composer-lyricist Jerry Herman. In ''MAME'', Vera Charles, Mame Dennis' actress-confidante pal, sings: "...I'll always be Alice Toklas, if you'll be Gertrude Stein."  (Bea Arthur, who played the original Vera Charles on Broadway, recreated the same role for the 1974 film version of the musical.)
In the 1998 Latin American literary classic ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', novelist [[Giannina Braschi]] pays homage to Stein as an imaginary mentor.

In 2005, playwright/actor [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed Stein in the solo musical ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1'' at [[Princeton University]]. In 2006, theatre director/actor [[Luiz Päetow]] created his solo, ''Plays'', portraying Stein's 1934 homonymous lecture, and toured [[Brazil]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jqz.cv.zip.net/arch2008-04-01_2008-04-30.html|title=Peças are Plays in Portuguese|publisher=uol}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Loving Repeating'' is a musical by [[Stephen Flaherty]] based on the writings of Gertrude Stein. Stein and [[Alice B. Toklas]] are both characters in the eight person show. 
Stein is a central character in [[Nick Bertozzi]]'s 2007 graphic novel ''The Salon''.

The posthumously published ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'' contain several highly hostile references to Gertrude Stein. From Rand's working notes for her novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', it is clear that the character Lois Cook in that book was intended as a caricature of Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mayhew|editor1-first=Robert|title=Essays on Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead"|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Md.

Stein (played by [[Bernard Cribbins]]) and [[Alice B. Toklas|Toklas]] (played by [[Wilfrid Brambell]]) were depicted in the playful [[Sweden|Swedish]] 1978 [[absurdist fiction]] film ''Picassos äventyr'' ''([[The Adventures of Picasso]])'' by director [[Tage Danielsson]], with [[Gösta Ekman]] as [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078084/ |title=The Adventures of Picasso |publisher=IMDB Internet Movie Database |date= |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein was portrayed in the 2011 [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' by [[Kathy Bates]], and by [[Tracee Chimo]] in the 2018 season of the television series ''[[Genius (U.S. TV series)|Genius]]'' which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.

Stein is added to a list of great artists and notables in the popular Broadway musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' in the song "[[La Vie Boheme]]".
She is also mentioned in the Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers 1935 film ''Top Hat'' and in the song "[[Roseability]]" by the Scottish rock group [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]].

Composer [[Ricky Ian Gordon]] and librettist [[Royce Vavrek]]'s opera ''[[27 (opera)|27]]'' about Stein and Toklas premiered at [[Opera Theatre of St. Louis]] in June, 2014 with [[Stephanie Blythe]] as Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/departments.aspx?type=OperaWatch |title=OperaWatch |publisher=Opera News |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Einhorn]] wrote the play ''The Marriage of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein'', a farce about their fantasy marriage that also told the story of their life.  It premiered in May 2017 at HERE Arts Center in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/theater/review-love-genius-and-the-marriage-of-alice-b-toklas-by-gertrude-stein.html |title=Love, Genius and The Marriage of Alice B.

'''Hymnal''' or '''hymnary''' or '''hymnbook''' is a collection of [[hymn]]s, usually in the form of a book. The earliest hand-written hymnals are from the [[Middle Ages]] in the context of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christianity]], although individual hymns such as the [[Te Deum]] go back much further. The [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, together with the growing popularity of [[moveable type]], quickly made hymnals a standard feature of Christian worship in all major denominations of Western and Central Europe. The first hymnal of the Reformation was ''[[Achtliederbuch]]'', followed by the ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion]]''. An important hymnal of the 17th century was ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.

The '''International Kodály Seminar''' was named after the famous Hungarian musician, ''[[Zoltán Kodály]]'', who was a composer, pedagogue, ethnomusicologist. He is well-known around the world as the creator of a music method: ''[[Kodály method]]''. Foreign musicians from all over the world come to see his birthplace, ''Kecskemét'' to get some inspiration, learn his method for a better pedagogy and listen to Hungarian choirs and concerts. These are the main points for musicians to visit ''[[Kecskemét]], Bács-Kiskun county''.

==History==
1970 was the year when the name and the event was born. ''Zoltán Kodály''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bacstudastar.hu/kz-csaladja|title=KZ családja - Bácstudástár|accessdate=2017-03-31|work=www.bacstudastar.hu|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;''’s widow'' and the primary and secondary Kodály school’s director, [http://www.parlando.hu/Nemesszegi.htm ''Márta'' ''Nemesszeghyné Szentkirályi''] had an idea about an international summer course. For their initiation the city advertised this course for learning the Hungarian music teaching in schools and the method’s basics. A lot of people interested in this course, so after two years the International Kodály Seminar was held again, second time. The first was in 1970 and the second, two years later, in 1972.

Since 1975, ''the [http://www.kodaly-inst.hu/en Kodály Institute of the Liszt Ferenc Academy]'' was active, they started organising the third Kodály Seminar. /The Seminar is organized every second year. An International Music Festival is also held at the same time./ While the first two courses’ main goal was for foreign professional musicians and was about the school teaching in music schools, since 1975 there was a big change, because they wanted to make the courses interesting for the Hungarian pedagogues too.

Their programmes, variations of opportunities was also motivating for the Hungarian audience. The aim of the Kodály Seminars was that: refreshing the possibilities, abilities to help the music teachers, conductors in their daily work. Kodály Seminar became year by year a voluntary self-education course; how to be a “good musician” and the human and professional music symbol.

Nowadays the aim of these courses is the comprehensive demonstration of the Hungarian music education in practical and pedagogical works, Kodály’s and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]’s lifework. The programme consists of daily conducting lessons, solfege lessons, methodology classes, choral singing and concerts.

In 1987 with the Seminar the International Kodály Symposium was held; a new summer programme started. Workshops were in different topics: folk music, music analysis.

The 20th International Kodály Seminar was held in 1999 which was the [http://www.bacstudastar.hu/image/image_gallery?uuid=f0a0ba33-a626-4625-8885-03ab84d75231&amp;groupId=10804&amp;t=1330598852454 Jubilee] of the tradition since 1970.

There have been approximately 2200 participants from 42 different countries during the Seminars.

In this year (17-28 July 2017) will be the 29th International Kodaly Seminar with a lot of programmes and concerts.

[[File:Ann SHERIDAN-James CAGNEY-Angels Dirty Faces-PHOTO2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ann Sheridan]] as [[James Cagney]]'s leading lady in ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'']]
'''Leading lady''' is a term often applied to the [[leading actress]] in the performance if her [[fictional character|character]] is the [[protagonist]]. It is also an informal term for the [[actress]] who plays a secondary lead, usually a [[love interest]], to the [[leading actor]] in a film or play. 

A leading lady can also be an actress of renown. For example, [[Lynn Fontanne]] and [[Helen Hayes]] were both referred to as the "leading lady of the theatre" in their time. Similarly, [[Mary Pickford]] was called the "leading lady" of the cinema.

The term has been applied to an actress who is often associated with one particular actor. For example, [[Olivia de Havilland]] was [[Errol Flynn]]'s leading lady in several films, [[Katharine Hepburn]] had a similar association with [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Lauren Bacall]] with [[Humphrey Bogart]], and [[Maureen O'Hara]] with [[John Wayne]]. A leading lady is also an actress who is [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in romantic supporting roles.

The term can also be used collectively; for example, the phrase "[[Hollywood]]'s leading ladies" can be used to refer to a group of notable, famous, or popular actresses.

Many modern day leading ladies includes: [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Claire Danes]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Mariska Hargitay]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Blake Lively]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Rihanna]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Emma Stone]], [[Emma Watson]], [[Rebel Wilson]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Sofia Vergara]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42047">{{Distinguish|List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien sketches|List of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien sketches}}

The following is a list of recurring [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] and characters which debuted on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. ''Conan'' is a talk/variety show starring [[Conan O'Brien]] and sidekick [[Andy Richter]]. Writers [[Deon Cole]], [[Brian Stack]], Andres du Bouchet, Dan Cronin, and members of [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band|The Basic Cable Band]] (especially [[Richie Rosenberg|Richie "LaBamba" Rosenberg]]), as well as propmaster Bill Tull, often appear in sketches as well. Some sketches feature celebrity cameos.

==Characters==

===Returning characters===

The classic ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' characters The Interrupter, The [[Masturbating Bear]] and [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]] have made appearances on ''Conan''.  In some cases, due to complaints, the Masturbating Bear is referred to by an alternate name, "The Self-Pleasuring Panda."

=== Punxsutawney Dr. Phil ===
A hybrid of Dr. [[Phil McGraw]] and [[Punxsutawney Phil]], this puppet talk show host groundhog first appeared after [[Groundhog Day]] in 2014. He appears as a groundhog with a bald head, Dr. Phil-style eyes, and a mustache. After dispensing nonsensical relationship advice and theories about certain things, such as the mafia being responsible for celebrity relationships ending, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then accuses Conan, who always criticizes him, of various false issues, such as prostitution, alcoholism, and cocaine addiction, using cut-together voice clips from the actual Dr. Phil Show. Conan is stunned by the accusation, strongly denying it, but Andy confirms it, much to his chagrin. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then promises to help Conan with his anger problems, prompting Conan to ask what will happen if he refuses to take his help. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil responds "Then I will kill you," while brandishing a switchblade knife. Then after going back into the grass, Conan ends the sketch saying to catch the Punxsutawney Dr. Phil Show weekdays at 4:00. 

=== The Flaming C ===
Conan and [[Bruce Timm]] created The Flaming C, a character based on Conan's appearance and jokingly referred to it as DC Comics' next superhero. The character has a comical appearance due to wearing things not associated with superheroes, such as a steaming ovenmit, a [[jai alai]] glove, ski goggles, a [[Star of David]] patch, socks with garters, [[fishnet]] stockings and loafers. Faux videos have been made where the character appears on the show ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://videos.nymag.com/video/Conan-The-Flaming-C-on-Young-Ju;Viral-2 Watch "Conan: The Flaming C" [Young Justice] New York Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/11/conan-obrien-the-flaming-c-meets-superboy-video/ Conan O'Brien's The Flaming C Meets Superboy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214085414/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/11/conan-obrien-the-flaming-c-meets-superboy-video/ |date=2011-02-14 }} ''Comics Alliance'' February 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Conan also played a faux trailer for an animated feature film about the character. The character also had a dedicated segment at the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. Conan later brought in a lifesize [[Lego]] statue of the character made by a viewer. On Conan's Clueless Gamer segment, he played as the Flaming C in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/video/conan-highlight-clueless-gamer-injustice&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2015 Comic-Con, it was turned into a weekly series on the show.

===The New York City Heckler===
A man ([[Eddie Pepitone]]) stands up and angrily yells at Conan in response to jokes in the monologue. He always dies of a heart attack at the end of the skit.

=== Basketball Mascots That Should Never Dunk ===
Conan mentions his favorite part of basketball is the dunking mascots at halftime.  He then introduces us to some weird mascots who should never compete in a slam dunk contest.  As he lists them, a guy dressed as that mascot attempts to dunk the ball, usually resulting in failure.  Some of these mascots include: The Solar System, Cop at a urinal, Congressman Anthony Weiner's underpants, and the Human Starfish.  As of November 17, 2011, only 3 mascots have completed this feat successfully.

=== Minty, the Candy Cane That Briefly Fell on the Ground ===
Timed for the Christmas season, Minty is a giant candy cane (originally played by [[Brian McCann (actor)|Brian McCann]], and replaced by Deon Cole after McCann left the show; the lyrics to his theme song changed after Cole replaced McCann.) who walks through the crowd throwing mini candy canes to the audience members as a 1940s crooner-style jingle plays in the background. According to the jingle, he fell on the ground for "just a moment or two", which was enough for him to be covered in "excrement". Actually, his costume is covered in the typical kind of garbage that might be found on a dirty floor, such as dead bugs, hair, a penny and a cigarette butt. One loyal fan created a video game based on the character,&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamcoco.com/mintygame Minty The Candy Cane - THE GAME] ''Team Coco'' December 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which was posted to the show's website.

=== Ted Turner ===
TBS founder [[Ted Turner]], played by [[Will Forte]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/11/conan-gets-berated-by-wil_n_782089.html Conan Berated By Will Forte As Ted Turner] ''The Huffington Post'' November 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; appears on a stuffed buffalo named Teddy Jr. to harshly criticize Conan and his audience and claiming the show will ruin the reputation of TBS. Conan eventually brought out his own buffalo and challenged Turner to a duel but the buffaloes instead began mating, with Teddy Jr. being the "receiver".

===Wikibear===
Wikibear is a talking teddy bear (voice by [[Brian Stack]]) that is meant to answer any question by connecting to Wikipedia via a [[Bluetooth]] connection. After correctly doing so, it will talk about topics that are extremely inappropriate for children, i.e. terminal diseases, famine, natural disasters, cannibalism, mass violence, serial killers, war battles, deadly animals, and death. Conan always points out these facts, and says a software overhaul should fix the problems, but Wikibear proves that claim to be false by continuing to do so.

Wikibear's incorrect claim that [[Al Capone]] died of [[syphilis]] was challenged by a viewer on a [[#Fan Corrections|Fan Corrections]] segment, who stated he actually died of [[cardiac arrest]]. Conan supported Wikibear's statement with fake archived video of Capone's private physician affirming the false cause of death.

===Old Japanese Guy===

When Conan mentions an actor has been picked for a new superhero role or an athlete has signed with a new team, an elderly Japanese man with poor English in the audience tries to tell Conan why he would have been better for the job, usually wearing an outfit to match.

===Comic Khan===
At the show's visit to 2016 Comic Con in San Diego, Conan introduced Comic [[Khan Noonien Singh|Khan]] (Andres du Bouchet), the ''[[Star Trek]]'' villain, now a stand up comedian, whose jokes are all insults directed towards [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and his own weight gain. He returned in 2017.

==Recurring segments==

===Alex Trebek Has Gone Insane===
Conan shows clips of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] reading nonsensical clues of which contestants cannot answer, all the while questioning the long-time host's mental state. The clips are actually spliced from several different clues to form one bizarre giant clue. Trebek later appeared in a cameo and did the same to Conan, and left by saying a bizarre statement in person.

===Andy's news stories===
Andy previews some fake news stories he's working on for the next week complete with fake previews or [[stock footage]], all of which are ridiculous.

===Andy Richter's Sports Blast===
Andy hosts what seems like a traditional sports show, but instead gives off the impression that he has no clue about sports and is very ill-prepared.  Examples of this would be when he goes over the week's NFL games and picks the winners based on a real life matchup, (Redskins vs. Cowboys, he picks the Cowboys because he's seen enough western movies to know how it turns out.) and the Clip of the Week in which he shows a clip that has nothing to do with sports. He also takes questions from viewers who criticize his ignorance, and answers them with only "Good question, [viewer's name]."  Richter is also very repetitive in this sketch, as in this introduction: "Welcome to Andy Richter's Sports Blast.  I'm Andy Richter, and this is Sports Blast!"

===Audience Craigslist ads===
Conan shows audience members along with bizarre (fake) [[Craigslist]] ads they have posted, in the categories man seeking woman/woman seeking man/missed connections, job offers/seeking work and for sale/wanted to buy. The ads are usually embarrassing or perverted.

===Bill Tull's Budget Holiday Tips===
Propmaster Bill Tull gives examples of how to make holiday decorations and gifts out of things found around the house.  Tips are always the form of "Take a..., add a..., BOOM!..."  Example: "Take a piece of red tape, tape it to a pine cone; BOOM!, Christmas ornament."  Between tips, Conan often makes faces of displeasure that more tips are coming, before indicating that another will come.

===Basic Cable Name That Tune===
Conan plays ''[[Name That Tune]]'' with the audience, except that the songs are re-written as sound-alikes with alternate lyrics so the show would not have to pay [[royalties]] and avoid being sued for [[copyright infringement]], and the contestants have to guess what the original song was. The songs are sung by homeless lounge singer Brian LaFontaine ([[Brian Stack]]), whom Conan frequently expresses his contempt for.

===Boomers With Too Much Time On Their Hands===
Conan mentions that 10,000 [[baby boomers]] retire a day, and shows actual YouTube videos of how some who recently have are spending all of their free time now, which involve them doing things much younger people would do, including gymnastics, trying new dance moves, and racing go-carts in the street.

===Buzzfeed is running out of lists===
Conan talks about the site [[BuzzFeed]], best known for its unusual lists. Conan claims that the site is running out of ideas for lists and he even tries to prove this thesis by showing bizarre faux lists that are supposedly on BuzzFeed.

===Celebrity Income Breakdown===
Conan shows pie charts of how celebrities earn their money, first with real sources then fake ones that insult the subjects.

=== Celebrity Survey ===
In this sketch, Conan has supposedly sent out questionnaires to celebrities and he reads their replies. Conan reads a question and then recites the answer that each of three celebrities gave. The answers of the first two celebrities are ordinary "straight" answers. The third is the gag answer and often relates to something unseemly about the celebrity. For example, to the question: "I like to think of my viewers as people who..." [[Brian Williams]] wrote "want to be informed." [[Meredith Vieira]] wrote "want to be my friend." [[Tony Danza]] wrote "have broken both arms and can't change the channel;" A running joke has the survey frequently including a question which is answered by O.J. Simpson somehow referring to committing murder. To the question: "My favorite time of day is..." [[Evangeline Lilly]] wrote: "Dawn." [[Matt Lauer]] wrote "Twilight". [[O. J. Simpson]] wrote: "Murder O'Clock." A reply where [[Paris Hilton]] is the final respondent to a question has been used in every segment for at least the last four years, usually about her promiscuous dating habits. O'Brien and bandleader [[Max Weinberg]] have been used as well, with answers that perceive O'Brien as a loser and Max as a pervert. Another running gag has [[Larry King]], [[Chris Christie]] and [[Barack Obama]] answering, usually poking fun at King's elderly age (even going as far as to him making responses such that he created the universe or something similar), Christie's weight and Obama repeatedly mentioning that he ordered the killing of [[Osama bin Laden]].  Actress [[Lindsay Lohan]] and her drunken car crashes, [[Gary Busey]]'s bizarre statements, [[Nicolas Cage]]'s poor film role choices, and [[Aerosmith]] front man [[Steven Tyler]]'s similarity to a middle aged woman have also been portrayed in the sketch repeatedly.

===Citizenship test===
Conan states he believes all Americans should pass the U.S. citizenship test before they are allowed to vote, then takes the test himself. His version begins with serious American history questions like the actual test (which Conan answers thoroughly and correctly), then devolves into popular culture and sexual questions. One example of this is:

Andy: "When is it not appropriate to say the phrase 'That's what she said?"&lt;br&gt;
Conan: "Never."&lt;br&gt;
Andy: "Conan, I'm surprised you're answering these correctly. They're really hard!"&lt;br&gt;
Conan: "Heh-heh! That's what she said

There is a recurring theme among the last two questions in each sketch: the next-to-last question involves Conan giving a detailed explanation of a somewhat-obscure American history topic, while the last question references a pop culture or sex question asked earlier in the sketch.

===Clueless Gamer===
Conan, with little to no gaming experience or interest, tries out new video game releases while bantering back and forth with content producer and avid gamer Aaron Bleyaert and a celebrity guest. Initially launched as a web-only franchise, Clueless Gamer grew to become one of the most popular segments on the regular show. Most of the segments have featured new games on current systems, though one segment had Conan and Aaron playing classic [[Atari 2600]] games, including ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', widely considered the [[List of video games notable for negative reception#E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)|worst video game of all time]]. A full series based on Clueless Gamer is currently in development for TBS, with Conan executive producing but not hosting the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/conan-obrien-clueless-gamer-1201953627/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clutch Cargo===
Conan conducts a satellite interview with a celebrity, in reality a member of the show's staff whose mouth is superimposed over the celebrity's photo (a technique known as [[Synchro-Vox]] best known for its use in the cartoon series ''[[Clutch Cargo]]''). Celebrities impersonated on ''Conan'' include [[Donald Trump]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who promotes his "smash hit holiday classic" ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'' as he had frequently done on ''Late Night''.

===Coffee Table Books That Didn't Sell===
Conan reviews coffee table books that didn't sell, such as "Movie Stars With Their Eyes Pushed Closer Together" or "Dirty Crop Circles" (the back of which was so dirty it had to be censored).
In late January 2016, Conan presented a variation titled "Calendars That Didn't Sell".

===Comedy for DVRs===
Conan explains how a lot of his viewers record his show with their [[Digital Video Recorder|DVR]], and does a skit which requires viewers to pause and un-pause their DVRs rapidly to watch it properly: a long list of text which scrolls by in a few seconds. So far the list titles have been "New ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' Characters", and "[[Nicolas Cage]]'s Next 400 Films".

===Conan's Peanut Players===
Conan mentions a recent celebrity or other unusual newsworthy incident, but says there's no actual footage of it. Instead, he shows a reenactment of it using shelled peanuts and toys.

=== Conan's Video Blog ===
Conan announces he is going to share his thoughts via a blog to appeal to his broadening online following by adolescent viewers. The screen then cuts to a simulation of a webcam with Conan in front of a wall in what looks like a typical teenager's room. Conan puts a webcam near his face and speaks in a nervous, monotonous voice. Much of the segment is devoted to Conan saying things that are stereotypically said in teenagers' YouTube videos, such as reviews of movies and TV shows, strange snack ideas he invented and funny photo-shopped pictures he created. All of his segments are introduced using a computer generated voice. Andy sometimes joins Conan as well.

===Deon Cole Breaks Down the News===
Conan tells about a controversial topic in the news while Deon Cole rolls by on a small desk asking yes or no questions about it to quell the controversy, and ends with "Well then they should shut the fuck up!".

===Director's Cuts===
Conan will show rare, never-before-seen director's cuts of clips from classic [[Warner Brothers]] movies, which always end with the main character being murdered.

===Donald Trump phone calls===
After the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. Presidential election]], Conan began airing audio from faux phone calls between incoming President [[Donald Trump]] ([[John Di Domenico]]) and outgoing President [[Barack Obama]] (Ben Campbell), in which Trump asks Obama for advice, or just to chat, shown in a split screen of actual photographs of them on the phone. The calls are meant to make Obama seem intelligent and knowledgeable and Trump to appear immature, foolish and unprepared for the presidency. Some of the calls had his daughter [[Ivanka Trump]] screaming like a spoiled teenager in the background or [[Melania Trump]] pleading for help. 

Later skits had Trump talking to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], some of which where interrupted by a naive and over trusting [[Donald Trump Jr.]] (who had just accidentally given private, incriminating emails to the pizza delivery man).

===Facebook photos===
Conan will pick a member of the audience and take a photo of them with himself using a [[green screen]] and props and suggest they make it their [[Facebook]] profile picture.

===Fan Corrections===
Conan shows videos from viewers who believe they've caught a factual mistake made on the show. However, Conan will claim they don't make mistakes, and so far, they've had "hundreds of challengers, not one winner". Conan will then make up a ridiculous story to explain the error and back it up with fake or doctored footage, or fake experts played by the show's writers, all while berating the accuser. When the sketch is over he challenges viewers to "see if they have what it takes to make chump meat out of the maestro".

===If They Melded===
In an updated version of the classic ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' sketch [[If They Mated]], two videos of celebrities are merged, usually the face of one onto another while the second talks (i.e. [[Nicki Minaj]]'s face and voice on President Obama's head and torso).

===Local News Round-Up===
Conan explains that since the show airs during local newscasts, they decided to make one of their own, with stories and items stereotypically found in them (a fire on the bad part of town, a city council meeting, a short weather forecast, the local sports team won, and a lighthearted animal video at the end). Other sketches have featured Ritcher as an investigative reporter or as a weatherman (reporting on a flurry of snow on LaBamba).

===Memba This?===
Andy reveals his new bit, which involves him saying "Memba This?" repeatedly at pictures of fads and personalities in the news from years past.  When Conan replies that this is not really a bit, Andy responds with more pictures of personalities, only this time saying "Memba Him?", "Memba Her" and "Memba Them?"  Fed up, Conan tries the bit himself, only the pictures he is given are disturbing, causing him to recoil in disgust.  Andy makes it better by saying "Memba This" and showing pictures of Conan recoiling at his "Memba This" pictures.

===Mike Merritt's Inner Thoughts===
As Conan responds to a news article about race and civil rights, the camera cuts to bassist Mike Merritt making comments, via voice over, about how Conan knows nothing about African Americans and cracks a joke about Conan's race.

The skit was later changed when Conan came out in support of gay marriage, with the thoughts coming from three of the show's gay staffers. They were able to communicate with each other telepathically, and claimed all gay people have the ability to do so but don't tell straight people about it.

===Movie Casting===
Conan mentions that a certain actor has been given a certain movie role in a superhero or fantasy movie sequel, an audience member dressed in the character's costume asks if he's sure. When Conan assures them that the part has been cast, the costumed-audience member leaves disappointed. So far, the roles included [[Gandalf]] and an [[African American]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] (''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''), [[Superman]] (''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'') and a man dressed as [[Catwoman]] (''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'').

===New TBS shows===
Conan explains TBS' asked his staff to help develop original shows for the network, and runs of a clip from one. They are often simply parodies of other current shows.

===Newscasters Agree===
"Newscasters Agree" (also known or referred to as "Media Reacts") is a segment in which Conan presents to the audience a montage of dozens of local news anchors presenting "their own fresh take" on stories in the news.  The stories the anchors present are usually in the scope of [[human interest]] or entertainment stories, with the lead headline presented by the anchors in near-precise, word-for-word unison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-local-tv-trend-and-now-the-identical-news/2012/11/27/9369a308-38bd-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html?hpid%3Dz3 "A local TV trend: And now, the identical news,"] from ''Washington Post'', 11/27/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthemedia.org/story/yeah-baby-yeah-baby-yeah-baby/ "Yeah baby, yeah baby, yeah baby,"] from ''On the Media'' ([[NPR]]/[[WNYC]]), 10/25/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some prime examples have included:

"[[Twinkie]] Trouble!" in regards to the bankruptcy of [[Hostess Brands]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamcoco.com/video/media-reacts-to-twinkie-shortage "Newscasters Agree: Hostess Twinkies Are In Trouble!"] from TeamCoco.com, 11/19/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Is it time for dogs to have a [[social networking|social network]] of their own?" about the website [http://matchpuppy.com matchpuppy.com],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZElSajQdOo "Is It Time For Dogs To Have A Social Network Of Their Own?"] video from the Team Coco page on YouTube, posted 5/9/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[[Mike Myers]] says 'Yeah, Baby!'" about the actor who played [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] becoming an expectant father&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIevazPIPzU "Media Reacts: Yeah, Baby edition,"] video from the Team Coco page on YouTube, posted 10/18/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Don't worry, be happy," a story on how positive attitudes lead to healthy lifestyles (with a few references to the [[Bobby McFerrin]] [[Don't Worry, Be Happy|song of the same name]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamcoco.com/video/newscasters-agree-be-happy# "Newscasters Agree: Don't Worry, Be Happy,"] from TeamCoco.com, 1/29/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Next on Conan===
Like other basic cable shows (''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'') Conan shows clips from their next episode (which are actually from old episodes) that seem melodramatic when played out of context.

===Oscar moments===
Conan, Andy and Pierre (poorly) reenact scenes from films nominated for Best Picture at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. They performed clips from ''[[127 Hours]]'', ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'', ''[[The Social Network]]'', and ''[[Inception]]''. In 2012 movies that were featured were ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'', ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]'' and ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]''.

In another set of skits, Conan mentioned that ''War Horse'' was nominated for Best Original Score, but he claimed the music doesn't make any sense. He then showed a dramatic scene from it, with the music replaced by an upbeat disco song.

===Oscar Winner F-Bomb Hall of Fame===
This list includes all [[Academy Awards]] winners who have appeared on the show and say the word "Fuck" during the interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbs.com/video/conan.jsp?oid=239687 Oscar Winner F Bomb Hall of Fame] ''Team Coco'' January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After the celebrity is inducted, Andy Richter reveals a bust statue that does not resemble the celebrity at all, with Andy claiming the best sculptors were unavailable so they had to make it themselves. So far there are three members of this Hall of Fame:
# [[Kevin Spacey]] 
# [[Javier Bardem]]
# [[Martin Scorsese]]
A potential fourth member, [[Natalie Portman]] (who was at the time in the running for an Oscar at the 83rd Academy Awards), did say the word "fuck" during her interview. Conan stated during her interview that he would add her to the hall if she won later (which she now has), but it has not happened yet.

===Puppy Conan===
As a parody of [[Animal Planet]]'s ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', Conan brings in a group of [[Labrador Retriever]] puppies dressed as himself, Andy, LaBamba and celebrity guests such as [[Flava Flav]] and [[Lady Gaga]], all within a miniature replica of the show's main set. Conan promised he would do an entire show with a miniature set with extremely tall guests like [[Shaquille O'Neal]], which he fulfilled a few weeks later.

===Racial Perspective===
After Conan mentions a story about something in the news that's controversial because of suspected racism, writer [[Deon Cole]] appears and gives a brief commentary, which is usually only a few words. For example, a class action lawsuit by animal rights group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] against [[SeaWorld]] which alleges the theme park treats its whales like African slaves in the United States prior to the [[American Civil War]], to which Cole's comment was "Are you shitting me?!" Deon will often have one of the show's white writers read his commentary instead, to avoid reinforcing the "angry black man" stereotype.

===Someone is thrown off the studio's roof by security===
Conan has demonstrated zero tolerance for obnoxious audience members, Andy's antics, and even a mascot for [[Anthony Weiner]]'s penis. There have been five or more instances where Conan has motioned for security to take away an offending character. They drag the person to the top of the studio's roof and then throw them onto the hard concrete lot below.

During the show's visit to [[Atlanta]] in April 2013, a mannequin of [[Union Army]] General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] (the victor of the [[Battle of Atlanta]]) was thrown off the roof of TBS' headquarters. When he didn't die, they deep fried his head in waffle batter and shot him out of the city from a giant cannon.

When the show was in San Diego for Comic Con in 2016, the security guards threw Captain Make America Great Again (a hybrid of [[Captain America]] and [[Donald Trump]]) out of a top floor window of the [[Spreckels Theater Building]].

===Things That Have Never Ever Been Said===
Conan and Andy take turns reading phrases that they claim have never been texted or tweeted ever before in the history of mankind. Examples include "I'm sorry I can't take a lunch break right now, we are totally swamped here at [[RadioShack]]."

===User agreements===
Conan will list hidden items of the [[terms of service]] for popular smartphone apps, such as on female driven dating app [[Bumble (app)|Bumble]], you agree to send unsolicited [[dick pic]]s.

=== What Am I Watching? ===
Conan mentions there's too many TV shows on the air to keep up with and how he uses the info button for more details, and then sees fake [[electronic program guide]]s, which insult the characters or the audience, including guide info for his own show which will insult him.

=== Why China Is Kicking Our Ass ===
Conan points out reasons for why "[[China]] is kicking our ass" such as better educated students and lower rates of unemployment. He then shows videos of people doing stupid things to injure themselves on purpose, or celebrities embarrassing themselves on television. Ironically, the Chinese text that appears on screen reads 瓷为什么踢我们的屁股 (Why [[Chinese ceramics|Porcelain]] Is Kicking Our Ass) instead of 为什么中国在踢我们的屁股. The mistake was noticed by several viewers who spoke Chinese during a [[#Fan Corrections|Fan Corrections]] segment, with Conan claiming they were all wrong, and showed a speech of [[Mao Tse-tung|Mao Se Tung]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]] (with mistranslated subtitles), declaring China's new name as the "People's Republic of Porcelain."
#&lt;li value="437"&gt; [[Drew Beaumier]] auditions for ''[[American Idol]]'' as a ''[[Transformers]]'' robot.
#&lt;li value="481"&gt; [[Gary Busey]] Vs. [[Meat Loaf]] on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''.
#&lt;li value="742"&gt; A man attempts to break a bottle on his friend's head, but it doesn't shatter and instead nearly knocks him out.
#&lt;li value="756"&gt; A man falls face-first from a set of bleachers onto a folding chair and hits his head.
#&lt;li value="757"&gt; A pickup truck attempts to go up a ramp and over a man holding a large ball but fails and runs the man over.
#&lt;li value="762"&gt; A man jumps off a roof, lands on a metal fence, and injures his testicles.
#&lt;li value="765"&gt; A man sings and whistles a cheesy original song while his friends dance poorly behind him.
#&lt;li value="777"&gt; A drunken man falls off the back of a slow moving car.
#&lt;li value="781"&gt; A man holds several fire crackers in his mouth, lights them and burns his lips.
#&lt;li value="781"&gt; A man kicks a soccer ball into his friend's crotch.
#&lt;li value="831"&gt; Sam B's performance on ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

#&lt;li value="921"&gt; A woman [[twerking|twerks]] in the seat of a moving car and falls out of the open door.

===Why Would You Tweet That?===
Conan reads some funny (fake) celebrity [[Twitter|tweets]] that make fun of the celebrities.

===TV Movie Casting===
A fictitious new [[made-for-TV movie]] is announced, based on a real-life event Conan has mentioned. Conan then says he has the inside scoop on the movie's casting. Viewers are shown two photos side-by-side of a person or thing who will be portrayed in the movie and the person that will be playing the role. The casting first starts off with people who strikingly resemble the person they are playing but then goes off to extremes with, usually, objects or fictitious characters bearing some resemblance to the person they are playing.

===The Audiencey Awards===
Conan awards members of the studio audience for various talents. Typically this will always include "best celebrity impression" to highlight lookalikes (as in movie casting), and then a variety of other awards which are achieved with props and superimposed images. For example, the winner of "Best Foreign Language Audience Member" was shown with a large superimposed mustache and sombrero, and the "Audience Member Who Smells the Most Like Fresh Salmon" was attacked by a man in a bear costume. Awards show intermission segments (a fashion critic, red carpet interviews, how the award is built, etc.) are also parodied.

==Celebrity cameos==
Sometimes on the show, celebrities make brief surprise cameos in skits.

===Chris Parnell explains a joke===
Conan mentions that the number of biracial babies is on the rise in the United States. Conan then brings out Deon Cole to comment, and all he said was "You're welcome America." Conan then said he didn't understand the joke. [[Chris Parnell]] then appeared and explained that Deon is so irresistible to fertile young women and his sperm is so potent, he's fathered thousands of biracial children.

He later returned to explain how Deon is able to take undistorted pictures of his enormous penis with the [[iPhone 5]]'s [[panoramic camera]]. He also explained that Deon's claim reinforces the stereotype that all black men have larger than average sized penises.

===Jon Cryer is a troll===
In response to ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' co-star [[Charlie Sheen]]'s comment that he was a troll, Cryer appeared in a cameo and confessed that he was indeed born a [[troll doll]], and that other celebrities such as [[Helen Mirren]] were also once trolls.

===Larry King's new show===
Conan announced that [[Larry King]] is hosting a new show in the rafters of his own studio. King appeared in a cameo and began taking calls from viewers, similar to the format of ''[[Larry King Live]]''. Andy Richter was always the show's celebrity guest.

===Theme song lyrics===

Conan mentions his theme song now has lyrics and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] appeared and performed it. The first half was normal, describing the show in general, but then turned dark, describing the time Yankovic and Conan went camping and Conan killed someone and swore Al to secrecy (which he had just broke by announcing it on national television, and feared Conan would kill him too).

===Nick Offerman from Parks and Recreation Reads Tweets from Young Female Celebrities===
Actor and [[woodworking]] enthusiast [[Nick Offerman]] reads actual [[Twitter|tweets]] from young (18–30 years old) female celebrities, such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Selena Gomez]] and [[Miranda Cosgrove]], while building furniture. They are often short and nonsensical, but read in a serious manner.

===Super Dave's lawsuit===

[[Super Dave Osborne]] appeared and explained he sued a plastic surgeon for a botched lip enhancement procedure. He explained the judge would award him $10,000,000 if he would go on a talk show, tell three dirty jokes, and prove the people weren't laughing at them, but at his ridiculous lips. After doing so, Conan claims he won the case.

===Conan and a fan meet Simon Baker===

Conan mentions ''[[The Mentalist]]'' is shot on the same lot as his show, and offers a fan of it accompany him to meet its star [[Simon Baker]]. After finding him reading a magazine behind the show's studio, Baker ran off as fast as he could.

===''Jersey Shore'' Audition Tapes===

Conan mentioned ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' is looking for new male cast members. He then showed audition tapes featuring [[Jack McBrayer]], [[DJ Qualls]], [[Jesse Eisenberg]], and [[John Lithgow]]. Actual ''Jersey Shore'' cast member [[Mike Sorrentino]] also briefly appeared, however the casting director quickly yelled "NEXT!"

===The Return of Max Weinberg===
On October 28, 2014, Conan noticed that their [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band|house band]]'s drummer [[James Wormworth]] had wandered off and fallen into an abandoned mine shaft. Conan then asked if anyone in the audience can play the drums, and [[Max Weinberg]], leader of the band of the show's original incarnation ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'', answered and ran onstage to drum for the remainder of the episode.

==Running gags==
*Contrary to reality, Conan often mentions TBS doesn't have the money for expensive writers, sets, props, skits, licensing fees, etc., equating it with a low-budget local [[public-access television|public access cable]] channel.
*When a website address is displayed, instead of showing a "/", a picture of guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] is shown.
*Whenever Conan makes an Anti-American remark (such as its obesity problem, recession, obsession with celebrities, reality shows, social networking, etc.), he'll make the crowd do the "[[U-S-A! (chant)|USA chant]]".
*If a man sitting in the front row wears a hat, Conan will try it on after being introduced at the beginning of the show.
*Conan has also began offering front row audience members to touch his nipples at the start of the show. Conan later showed a commercial for a fake lawyer who represents people who Conan has traumatized from doing so.
*Conan often likes to compare Thursday's audiences with Wednesday's, usually claiming one was horrible while the other is great (shows for both days are filmed with the same audience on Wednesdays).
*Another running gag is that Conan and Andy are secretly gay lovers (despite being married to women).

The practice of '''releasing [[video game soundtrack]]s on''' [[gramophone record|'''vinyl''' record]]s began in the 1980s, fell out of favor in the 1990s and 2000s as vinyl records were replaced by other storage media, and experienced a resurgence of interest in the 2010s due in part to a [[vinyl revival]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;

==History==
Vinyl recordings of video game music find their origins in the 1970s with early experiments by [[Kraftwerk]]&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt; and [[album]]s such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled 1978 release]] sampling electronic music from the games ''[[Circus (video game)|Circus]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and ''[[Gun Fight]]''.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In 1984, [[Haruomi Hosono]] released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, ''Video Game Music'',&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt;&lt;ref name=savorelli/&gt; and the practice experienced its "golden age" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including [[Buckner &amp; Garcia]]'s ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]'', [[Namco]]'s ''Video Game Graffiti'', and [[Koichi Sugiyama]]'s orchestral covers of the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to [[Promo (media)|promo releases]] with increasing use of video game [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in rap&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; and hip hop.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

The trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt; The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games,&lt;ref name=mcgeehan/&gt; and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like [[Black Screen Records]],&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; [[Data Discs]],&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; [[Brave Wave]], and [[iam8bit]],&lt;ref name=beaumontthomas/&gt; and shifts toward similar releases for labels like [[Ghost Ramp]],&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomer/&gt; [[Ship To Shore Phonograph Co.]],&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt; and [[Mondo Tees]].&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; In a 2015 article, music journalist [[Mike Diver]] suggested that "this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times", however he noted that some in the music industry, including [[Invada Records|Invada]] manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of [[Market saturation|over-saturation of the market]].&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs,&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble,&lt;ref name=gach/&gt; in 2017 ''Kotaku'' reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

The 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases [[Limited edition (music)|in limited numbers]] and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In addition, the practice has been adopted by the [[Cult video game|cult]]&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; and [[Indie game]] scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; interactivity,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; artwork,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; nostalgia,&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; unique content,&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible ([[Digital distribution|digitally distributed]]) products&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games,&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game,&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the "golden age" of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;

== Vinyl data ==
The use of grooved vinyl discs as a [[Sequencer (musical instrument)|sequenced/encoded]] rather than [[Analog recording|recorded]] data storage medium enabled the code of [[full motion video|full motion videos (FMVs)]] and even simple video games to be stored in an [[Analog recording|analog format]] along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED)]], and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] from the disc (typically a [[flexi disc]] like the ''Interface Age'' "[[Floppy ROM]]") onto an [[audio cassette tape]] which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore PET]], [[Commodore VIC-20]], [[Dragon 32/64]], [[ZX81]], or [[ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt; The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an [[arcade machine]]) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its [[record needle|stylus]] at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques ([[background noise]], [[Abrasion (mechanical)|scratches]], and [[Broken record|other audio-fidelity problems]])&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt;&lt;ref name="bennett82-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

Many webcomics artists have received honors for their work. In 2006, [[Gene Luen Yang]]'s graphic novel ''[[American Born Chinese]]'', originally published as a webcomic on [[Modern Tales]], was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;Bosman, Julie.

===Eisner Award===

{{Main|List_of_Eisner_Award_winners#Best_Digital_Comic/Webcomic}}

The Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's ''[[Nowhere Girl]]'' received a nomination for an Eisner award in the "best new series" category, while Shaw was nominated for "talent deserving of wider recognition", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Matthew (April 18, 2003). "DC leads in nominations; Norman artist in race for award". ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;21D.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of "[[digital comic]]" and "webcomic" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as [[Marvel Unlimited]] and [[DC Comics]]' "Digital First".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/05/why-the-eisners-need-to-show-webcomics-some-love.html|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|title=Why The Eisners Need to Show Webcomics Some Love|last=Rosberg|first=Caitlin|date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was split into "Best Digital Comic" and "Best Webcomic".

===Harvey Awards===

{{Main|List of Harvey Award winners#Best Online Comics Work}}

The Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher [[Fantagraphics]], are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the [[Kirby Awards]] which were discontinued after 1987.

Following the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to [[New York Comic Con]], the "Best Online Comics Work" has been renamed "Digital Book of the Year".&lt;ref name="comicsbeat"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Heidi |title=Details of the 2018 Harvey Awards announced and it’s a big change |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/details-of-the-2018-harvey-awards-announced-and-its-a-big-change/ |website=The Beat |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignatz Awards===

{{Main|Ignatz Award#Outstanding Online Comic}}

The Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual [[Small Press Expo]].

'''Literary fiction''' is a term used in the [[Publishing|book-trade]] to distinguish [[novel]]s that are regarded as having [[artistic merit|literary merit]] from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].  All the same, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]] publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate [[André Gide]] stated that [[Georges Simenon]], best known as the creator of the fictional detective [[Jules Maigret]], was "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that, while any definition will be simplistic, there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand, literary authors are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, Stephenson suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from October 20, 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the distinction is becoming blurred with major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]], as well as [[Margaret Atwood]], writing science fiction.  Doris Lessing described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by American composer and writer [[Ned Rorem]] as "one of the five greatest French writers of our century". Rorem placed Simenon in the company of [[Proust]], [[André Gide|Gide]], [[Cocteau]], and [[Sartre]]. 

In an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from June 14, 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Characteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following:
*A concern with [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}
*A focus on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} whose "inner stories" drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}}
*A slower pace than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}
*A concern with the [[style (fiction)|style]] and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}}
*Unlike genre fiction plot is not the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=181-182}} 
*The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}}

'''Marie Dainton''' (8 June c. 1881 – 1 February 1938) was an actress of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s who appeared regularly in both [[music hall]]s and in the legitimate theatre.

==Early career==
Dainton was born in Russia, apparently in 1881, although other sources cite 1877. Her father was Robert E. Sharlach and her mother was the English actress and singer Jenny Dawson (d. 1936). Dainton made her stage debut on 24 March 1894 at [[York Theatre Royal]] in ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''. In this show she gave imitations of well-known theatrical personalities, and this gift for mimicry became her trademark. Dainton became a versatile performer in various theatrical genres, including [[musical comedy]], [[pantomime]] and [[revue]].&lt;ref name=footlights&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextD/MarieDainton.html Dainton on 'Footlights Notes'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928134114/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextD/MarieDainton.html |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dainton made her first London appearance at the Metropolitan music hall in [[Edgware Road]] on 6 August 1894. On 24 December 1894 she opened as 'Mr Falsehood' in ''The House that Jack Built'' at the [[Opera Comique]], and the following year toured as 'Flo' in ''Buttercup and Daisy''. The next few years were spent appearing mainly in the [[music hall]]s until June 1899, when she scored a big success at the [[Avenue Theatre]] giving impressions of popular stage stars in a production entitled ''Pot Pourri''.&lt;ref name=stage&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html Dainton biography on the Stage Beauty website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 Dainton appeared in the [[pantomime]] ''[[Puss in Boots]]'' with [[Eugene Stratton]] at the Prince of Wales Theatre in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/musichall.html The Music Hall Pantomimes website]&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the legitimate theatre. Dainton was in demand both in London and on tour in the British provinces and abroad. During 1900 and 1901 she appeared at the [[Casino Theatre (New York City)|Casino Theatre]] in New York, and at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in London, as Paquita in ''[[The Belle of Bohemia]]''. In New York she was temporarily restrained from appearing in the show until a breach of contract case was resolved in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Dainton Enjoined", ''New York Times'', 20 November 1900&lt;/ref&gt; She also toured [[Austria]] as Fifi in ''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]''. At the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in London in 1902 she appeared in the successful musical play ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]''. In 1902 she made several gramophone recordings for the [[Gramophone Company|Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Co Ltd]] and [[Pathé]] of songs from this show, namely "The à la Girl", "Sweet Little Sing-Sing", and "Mandie of Ohio".&lt;ref name=footlights/&gt;

==Later years==
[[Image:marie-dainton2.jpg|thumb|right|Marie Dainton]]
Dainton was the original ''[[Peggy Machree]]'' at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in London from 28 December 1904, and played the leading role in the original production of ''[[The Girl Behind the Counter]]'', again at Wyndham's, from 21 April 1906. Dainton was a leading figure in the [[Music hall#.27Music Hall War.27 of 1907|Music Hall War]] of 1907,&lt;ref name=stage/&gt; alongside, among others, [[Joe Elvin]], [[Gus Elen]] and [[Marie Lloyd]]. At the [[Colonial Theatre (New York City)|Colonial Theatre]] in New York in March 1909 Dainton appeared in [[vaudeville]], again performing her mimicry of celebrities, including [[Harry Lauder]], [[Anna Held]], [[Marie Tempest]], [[Marie Lloyd]] and [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Dramatic Mirror, New York, Saturday, 20 March 1909, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1909 Dainton made a second tour of the United States, playing in [[Philadelphia]] and Chicago in ''The Silver Star'' and ''Madame Sherry''. In 1910 she toured the English provinces as Clarice in the opera ''[[The Mountaineers (opera)|The Mountaineers]]'' before returning to the [[music hall]]s. Among other productions, she took part in ''[[The Gay Hussars|Autumn Manoeuvres]]'' on tour in 1912, ''I Should Worry'' at The [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] and on tour in 1913.

She appeared in ''Society Ltd'' in 1920, ''Riverside Nights'' in 1926, ''The Eternal Flame'' in 1929, and in ''Getting George Married'' in 1930.&lt;ref name=stage/&gt; Her last appearances took place in the early 1930s, playing the Duchess of Capablanca in ''The Werewolf'', an eight performance run produced at the [[Kingsway Theatre]], London, on 9 November 1932 by the Independent Theatre Club; and as a Slut in the play ''Mary Read'' at London's [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=footlights/&gt;

==Death==
Marie Dainton died in London on 1 February 1938. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''Maximum Fighting Championship''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) promotion based in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. MFC’s former home, in Canada, is the River Cree Resort and Casino in Enoch, Alberta, located just outside Edmonton, Alberta but has also held events at the [[Edmonton Expo Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmamania.com/2010/5/8/1463318/mfc-25-results-recap-and-post|title=MFC 25 results, recap and post-fight discussion for 'Vindication' on May 7|author=James Iannotti|work=MMAmania.com|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MFC events are broadcast on [[The Fight Network]], [[AXS TV]] (formerly HDnet) in [[North America]] and most recently [[TSN2]].  MFC is known to be the biggest MMA promotion in Canada and one of the top MMA shows in the World. MFC has notable Canadian fighters, such as [[Ryan Jimmo]], Graham Spencer, [[Tom Watson (fighter)|Tom Watson]] and [[Douglas Lima]], plus MMA veterans, such as [[Jason MacDonald]], [[Thales Leites]], [[Jay Silva]], [[Trevor Prangley]], and [[Paul Daley]].&lt;ref name="mfc_org"&gt;http://www.maximumfighting.com/mfcorg.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maximum Fighting Championship was founded on March 3, 2001, by Pavelich Sports Inc. Mark Pavelich is the CEO of MFC and runs the business day to day. Dave Pavelich is Vice President and Manon Pavelich is the booker.

MFC currently airs on [[AXS TV Fights]] in the U.S. and [[The Fight Network]] in Canada. MFC’s former home was the ''River Cree Resort and Casino'' in Enoch, Alberta, Canada located just outside Edmonton, Alberta. Their new home is the ''Mayfield Inn Trade and Conference Centre'' Edmonton, Alberta. In July 2011, MFC signed a five-year live TV deal with [[HDnet]] (now [[AXS TV]]) and in October 2011, MFC signed with [[TSN2]].

MFC hosts heavyweight fights but doesn't have a heavyweight championship due to the lack of heavyweights outside of the top promotions.

MFC employs the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. All MFC bouts take place in a [[Boxing ring|ring]], with the exception of MFC 29 which, in accordance with the regulations utilized in Ontario which requires all mixed martial arts fights to be held in a cage structure, took place in a circular cage named "''The Ring''" by the winner of a "''Name the Cage''" fan contest.&lt;ref name="The Ring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumfighting.com/news/mfc-stays-in-the-ring/|title=MFC stays in THE RING|publisher=maximumfighting.com|date=2011-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225100900/http://www.maximumfighting.com/news/mfc-stays-in-the-ring/|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, MFC announced the re-launched its heavyweight division and the upcoming debut of a featherweight division. In 2013, the Maximum Fighting Championship also announced that the organization would add a bantamweight with the debut bout taking place on May 19, 2013 at MFC 37: True Grit.

===Attire===
All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, [[Keikogi|gis]] or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open-fingered gloves, that include at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ounces) that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple.

===Match outcome===
Matches usually end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps on the mat or his opponent or verbally submits.
*'''Technical Submission''': A technical submission is achieved when the referee stops a fight due to an injury resulting from a submission hold or due to a fighter going unconscious from a choke.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
*'''Technical Knockout''' (TKO): If a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ended as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage: (the referee determines a fighter cannot "intelligently defend" himself; if warnings to the fighter to improve his position or defense go unanswered—generally, two warnings are given, about 5 seconds apart)
**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor due to injury or impending injury, as when blood flows into the eyes and blinds a fighter)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's own corner-man signals defeat for their own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)&lt;ref name="mfc_rules"/&gt;

Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''', '''technical draw''', or '''no contest'''. The latter two outcomes have no winners.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points.

===Fouls===
The Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:&lt;ref name="mfc_rules"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 - Unarmed Combat]. Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
* After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one).
* If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
* Grabbing the ring ropes brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the ropes, the referee may charge a foul.

===Title fights===
On September 18, 2012 MFC instituted new regulations regarding title fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmamania.com/2012/9/18/3354394/maximum-fighting-championship-mfc-weigh-in-drug-testing|title=Maximum Fighting Championship (MFC) institutes new regulations for title fights, weigh-ins and drug testing|publisher=MMAmania.com|date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Title Fight with a reigning/defending champion'''
*If the champion fails to make weight:
**SCENARIO 1 - The champion vacates the title immediately. The fight remains a five-round contest. If the vacated champion wins the fight, the Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to automatically consider him the No. 1 contender for the next title fight in that weight class. The Maximum Fighting Championship also holds an option to make an immediate rematch.
**SCENARIO 2 - The champion vacates the title immediately. The fight remains a five-round contest. If the challenger wins the fight, the challenger becomes the MFC champion. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds an option to make an immediate rematch.
*If the challenger fails to make weight:
**The champion automatically retains the belt. A non-title fight takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. If the challenger wins the bout, the Maximum Fighting Championship holds an option to make a future rematch.
*If both fighters fail to make weight:
**The champion vacates the title immediately. A non-title fight takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to consider the winner of the bout as the No. 1 contender for the next title fight in that weight class. The Maximum Fighting Championship also holds an option to make future rematch.
'''Title Fight with a vacant championship'''
*If one fighter fails to make weight:
**The fight remains a five-round contest. If the fighter who made weight wins the bout, he becomes the MFC champion of that weight class. If the fighter who failed to make weight wins the bout, that fighter does not claim the title, and the Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to make him the No. 1 contender and/or to make an immediate rematch.
*If both fighters fail to make weight:
**A non-title bout takes place and the Maximum Fighting Championship solely determines if the bout is a three- or five-round fight. The Maximum Fighting Championship holds the option to make a future rematch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25341">'''Multiliteracies''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approach to [[literacy]] theory and [[pedagogy]].  This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: [[linguistic diversity]], and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in [[globalized]] environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new [[communications technologies]] such as the [[internet]], [[multimedia]], and [[digital media]], and the existence of growing linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] due to increased transnational migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new "literacy" must also be used and developed.
 
==Overview==
There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the [[English language]] is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, [[global language]], there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different [[Englishes]]. The way English is spoken in Australia,  South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.
 
The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate.  These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.

The formulation of  "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains.  The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities.  The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and [[numeracy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application to the real world ==

Due to changes in the world, especially [[globalization]] and an increase in [[immigration]], a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice.  Students need to draw on their own experiences and [[semiotic]] literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.

The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.

Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, [[vernacular]]s, as well as alternative forms of communication. 

== The New London Group ==
The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single [[national language]] and [[Standard English|standardized form of English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; [[Bill Cope (academic)|Bill Cope]] from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; [[Mary Kalantzis]] from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; [[Norman Fairclough]] from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; [[Gunther Kress]] from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; [[Allan Luke]] from Australia on critical literacy  and [[applied linguistics]]; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and [http://nuragili.unsw.edu.au/profilemartinnakata.html Martin Nataka] on [[indigenous education]] and [[higher education]] curriculum. The article "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures" published in 1996,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|last2=Group|first2=The New London|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the New London Group's "manifesto" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.

== A pedagogy of multiliteracies ==
The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of "[[metalanguage]]s" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Situated practice ==
Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope &amp; Kalantzis (2009)&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|date=2009-08-06|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15544800903076044|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044|issn=1554-480X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reframed it as “experiencing” (p.&amp;nbsp;184)''.'' They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.
* Experiencing the known–learners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar-listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title=‘The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.’ pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experiencing the new–learners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. [http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-5/kalantzis-and-cope-debating-authentic-pedagogy Authentic pedagogy]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196581.007|title=literacy|last=Kalantzis|first=Mary|last2=Cope|first2=Bill|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|publication-place=Cambridge|pages=95–117|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139196581.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to [http://newlearningonline.com/learning-by-design/glossary/didactic didactic pedagogy] in the twentieth century, initially through the work of [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dewey/ John Dewey] in the United States and [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Montessori Maria Montessori]  in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.

However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.

== Critical framing ==
Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cope, B.  |author2=Kalantzis, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2001|title = Putting ‘multiliteracies’ to the test|url = https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/59|journal = Newsletter of the Australian Literacy Educators Association.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.

Mills (2009)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mills|first = Kathy A.|date = 2009|title = Multiliteracies: interrogating competing discourses|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500780802152762|journal = Language and Education, 23:2, 103-116|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as "inferior literacies". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.

In addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. [http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3084/1/D4Writing_and_Multimodal_social_semiotics.pdf Domingo, Jewitt, &amp; Kress (2014)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Multimodal social semiotics: Writing in online contexts|last = Domingo, M., Jewitt, C. and Kress, G|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 1317510607|location = London|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.

Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Flicker, S., Danforth, J., Wilson, C., Oliver, V., Larkin, J., Restoule, J-P, Mitchell, C., Konsmo, E., Jackson, R. &amp; Prentice, T.|date = 2014|title = "Because we have really unique art": Decolonizing research with Indigenous youth using the arts.|url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ijih/article/view/13271|journal = International Journal of Indigenous Health|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, &amp; Buthelezi, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mitchell, C., DeLange, N., Moletsane, R., Stuart, J., &amp; Buthelezi, T.|date = 2005|title = Giving a face to HIV and AIDS: On the uses of photo-voice by teachers and community health care workers working with youth in rural South Africa|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088705qp042oa|journal = Qualitative Research in Psychology  |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=257–270|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo &amp; Rowsell, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Prinsloo, M., &amp; Rowsell, J.|date = 2012|title = Digital literacies as placed resources in the globalised periphery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2012.691511|journal = Language and Education |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–277|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overt instruction ==
===Original view===
In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;34).

===Updated view===
After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, 2015).&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; 
Conceptualizing involves "the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p.&amp;nbsp;19) occurs in two ways:
Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.

Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things
Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;).  
Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together

== Transformed practice ==
Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in [[Authentic Learning|authentic learning]], where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the "theory becomes [[reflective practice]]" (The New London Group, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.

Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed "Applying" as part of "Knowledge Processes" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;184),&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or [http://edglossary.org/competency-based-learning/ competency-based learning] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title='The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.' pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:
* Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] or [[meaning-making]] setting (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/[[simulation]] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).
* Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners’ interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

The '''New York Competition of Dramatic Arts''' (NYCODA) is an Annual Performance Festival and Competition for actors, located in [[New York City]].

NYCODA, established in the spring of 2008, is becoming known for its appeal to both amateur and professional actors, but with a wider appeal to other areas of the performing arts.  The company flew below the radar for a while, but is fast becoming known on the New York Performance Arts scene, and being identified as uniquely Brooklyn.  In fact, many are calling it a Brooklyn movement of performance artists and a haven for the aspiring actor.

NYCODA was established as an annual performance festival and competition, where actors can compete in different genres, such as Shakespearean Drama, Dramatic Duologue, Humorous Verse and Open Reading.  Actors compete in these categories, with the Open Reading category a favorite, because the actor has freedom to choose what to perform.  In fact, many actors write and perform their own work in this category.

The NYCODA competition is typically held in the Fall of each year in the [[New York City]] borough of Brooklyn.  Contestants submit samples of their performances, typically monologues, via the company's website.  The contestants are chosen months in advance, and are notified by the Summer preceding the Fall event.  The festival is a one-day event and category winners are chosen at the end of the night and presented with some of the most sought after awards in the industry, with the biggest award, The NYCODA Actor Award going to the overall winner of the festival.  The event is recorded for television purposes.

While the NYCODA festival primarily features competing actors, many other performance artists are included.  Dancers, singers and other performers help add to the rich and complex texture of the event, and now the festival is being called the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Festival]] of Brooklyn and the buzz is already alive in the community of aspiring actors, who see the festival and competition as another outlet to have their skills recognized and an opportunity to perform live on stage in front of a large audience.

Many noteworthy organizations are already in line to endorse the NYCODA movement, and to applaud it as the festival for which New York has long waited.  The company has begun to develop an international outlook and has begun partnering with international agencies, in Africa and Europe.  Through their international program, NYCODA welcomes actors and performance artists from all over the country and all over the world, and some NYCODA contestants have the opportunity to perform internationally as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">'''Participatory video''' is a form of [[participatory media]] in which a group or community creates their own film. The idea behind this is that making a video is easy and accessible, and is a great way of bringing people together to explore issues, voice concerns or simply to be creative and tell stories. It is therefore primarily about process, though high quality and accessible films (products) can be created using these methods if that is a desired outcome. This process can be very empowering, enabling a group or community to take their own action to solve their own problems, and also to communicate their needs and ideas to decision-makers and/or other groups and communities. As such, PV can be a highly effective tool to engage and mobilise marginalised people, and to help them to implement their own forms of sustainable development based on local needs.

== Process ==

* Participants (men, women and youth) rapidly learn how to use video equipment through games and exercises.
* Facilitators help groups to identify and analyse important issues in their community by adapting a range of Participatory Rural Apraisal (PRA)-type tools with participatory video techniques (for example, social mapping, action search, prioritising, etc.)
* Short videos and messages are directed and filmed by the participants. 
* Footage is shown to the wider community at daily screenings.
* A dynamic process of community-led learning, sharing and exchange is set in motion.
* Completed films can be used to promote awareness and exchange between various different target groups. InsightShare, for example, has worked with pastoralists, farmers, marginalised communities and youth in rural and urban settings, street children, refugees and asylum seekers, people with mental health problems, learning difficulties and physical disabilities.
* Participatory video films or video messages can be used to strengthen both horizontal communication (e.g. communicating with other communities) and vertical communication (e.g. communicating with decision-makers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lunch|first=Nick and Chris|title=Insights into Participatory Video|url=http://www.insightshare.org/sites/default/files/file/Insights%20into%20Participatory%20Video%20-%20A%20Handbook%20for%20the%20Field%20%28English%29%281%29.pdf|publisher=Insight Share}} Accessed: 2013 11 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to documentary filmmaking ==
Whilst there are forms of documentary filmmaking that are able to sensitively represent the realities of their subjects' lives and even to voice their concerns, documentary films very much remain the authored products of a documentary filmmaker. As such, the subjects of documentaries rarely have any say (or sometimes have some limited say) in how they will ultimately be represented. By contrast, in PV the subjects make their own film in which they can shape issues according to their own sense of what is important, and they can also control how they will be represented. Additionally, [[documentary film]]s are often expected to meet stringent aesthetic standards and are usually made with a large audience in mind. The PV process, on the other hand, is less concerned with appearance than with content, and the films are usually made with particular audiences and objectives in mind.

== Origins ==
The first experiments in PV were the work of Don Snowden, a Canadian who pioneered the idea of using media to enable a people-centered community development approach. Then Director of the Extension Department at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], Snowden worked with filmmaker [[Colin Low (filmmaker)|Colin Low]] and the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s [[Challenge for Change]] program to apply his ideas in [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland]], a small fishing community.&lt;ref name="OISE"/&gt; By watching each other’s films, the different villagers on the island came to realise that they shared many of the same problems and that by working together they could solve some of them. the films were also shown to politicians who lived too far away and were too busy to actually visit the island. As a result of this dialogue, government policies and actions were changed. The techniques developed by Snowden became known as the Fogo process.&lt;ref name="Quarry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quarry|first=Wendy|title=The Fogo Process: An Experiment in Participatory Communication|publisher=Thesis, [[University of Guelph]]|location=1994|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~snowden/fogo.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011104141440/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~snowden/fogo.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2001-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden went on to apply the Fogo process all over the world until his death in India in 1984.

The first community-made video in Canada was the 1969 Challenge for Change video ''[[VTR St-Jacques]]'', filmed in a poor [[Montreal]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="VTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=10875|title=VTR Saint Jacques|year=1969|work=Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make ''VTR St-Jacques'', directors [[Dorothy Henault]] and [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]] trained community members in video to represent their struggle for affordable and accessible medical care. ''VTR St-Jacques'' was shown across Canada and the U.S., inspiring other projects.&lt;ref name="OISE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1966cfc.html|title=Challenge for Change launched, a participatory media approach to citizenship education|last=Schugurensky|first=Daniel |year=2005|work=History of Education|publisher=The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT)|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been no uniform movement to promote and practise PV but different individuals and groups have set up pockets of PV work, usually molding it to their particular needs and situations. PV has also grown with the increasing accessibility of home video equipment.

An early and significant book on participatory video was published in the UK in 1997 by Clive Robertson and Jackie Shaw, Directors of Real Time Video, and has informed many subsequent books and articles, including the book this article has drawn from. Real Time are an educational charity that pioneered many of the techniques and methodologies still used today, and have been working in the participatory video field since 1984.

== Applications ==

In combination with other methodologies such as Participatory Learning in Action (PLA) techniques, [[Participatory Rural Appraisal]] and others. PV has been successfully applied to projects focussing on; [[community development]]; promoting local innovation and endogenous development; therapeutic work; a voice for marginalised groups; a catalyst for community-led action; a tool for communicating with policy makers; a means of involving users in their own research for example [[action research]], participatory research, user-led research; also for programme [[monitoring and evaluation]] or [[Social impact assessment]]...new possible applications are being continually developed.

'''Playlyfe''' is a software product company headquartered in [[Bangalore, India]].

== History ==
While working for the student volunteer organization [[AIESEC]] Jaipur, Johny Jose struck upon the idea of increasing engagement of its volunteers by using game mechanics. At that time, Johny was pursuing his B.Tech from [[LNMIIT]], Jaipur. He pitched this idea to his batchmates - Kumar Harsh and Bhavya Agarwal, who banded together, and Playlyfe started off in 2011.&lt;ref name=et-tech-june-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=Krithika|title=Playlyfe: the invisible platform that powers gamification in enterprises|url=http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/playlyfe-gamification/47552594|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=ETTech|publisher=The Times Group|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from college in 2012, they continued working on the product in [[New Delhi]]. Around the end of that year, Bhavya left to pursue higher education, and the rest of the team went through three iterations of the product, refining the user experience and the mechanics Playlyfe offered. Playlyfe moved base to Bangalore in 2014, where Chitresh Parihar joined as a co-founder.

== Product ==
In 2017, Playlyfe started offering another product, Catalyst, aimed at improving the performance of sales teams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getcatalyst.in/|title=Catalyst - A new and better way to drive your sales team|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the past, Playlyfe offered a developer-focussed platform which lets its users design gamified systems in their browsers, test its effectiveness in a simulation environment, and then integrate the design with their web and mobile apps or websites via Playlyfe's [[REST]] [[API]]. It's aim was to reduce the barrier to gamification by simplifying the process of designing gamified systems.

== Awards and Recognitions ==
Rated as one of the top 10 enterprise-grade gamification platforms in the world in the Gamification Industry Report  compiled by the Enterprise Gamification Consultancy.&lt;ref name=egc-apr-2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herger|first1=Mario|title=Gamification Industry Report 2015 - Now Available!|url=http://www.enterprise-gamification.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=255:gamification-industry-report-2015-now-available&amp;lang=en|website=Enterprise Gamification Consultancy|publisher=Enterprise Gamification Consultancy|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playlyfe won the most promising startup award at InTech50 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=Krithika|title=For the game of life, gamification is the new mantra|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/for-the-game-of-life-gamification-is-the-new-mantra/articleshow/47547726.cms|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Economic Times|agency=Times Network|publisher=Bennet Coleman &amp; Co.

"'''Reach for the Stars'''", alternately subtitled "'''Mars Edition'''" and "'''NASA Edition'''", is a song written, produced and recorded by American recording artist [[will.i.am]] in commemoration of the landing of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on the planet [[Mars]]. First released on August 28, 2012 as a promotional single, the song also appears on the deluxe edition of his fourth studio album ''[[willpower (will.i.am album)|#willpower]]'' (2013). "Reach for the Stars (Mars Edition)" became the first song in history to be broadcast from another planet, completing a journey of more than 300 million miles between Mars and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/29/us/mars-single/index.html?hpt=hp_c2 |title=Will.i.am premieres song -- from Mars |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2014 |last=Karimi |first=Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development ==
"Reach for the Stars" was written in February 2011, after NASA asked will.i.am to write and produce a song for the Curiosity rover's landing on Mars. The songwriter said that the experience with NASA administrator Charles Bolden discussing the possibility of broadcasting a song from Mars was "surreal". The song is part of NASA's educational outreach, with will.i.am stating that the song "aims to encourage youth to study science". Rather than produce a song via the computer, will.i.am stated that he wanted to show "human collaboration", which featured a 40-piece orchestra. He added that "people in my field aren't supposed to try and execute something classical, or orchestral, so I wanted to break that stigma, [and have something] that would be timeless and translated in different cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/william-to-debut-track-on-mars-using-speakers-of-the-curiosity-rover/story-e6frfn09-1226458672800 |title=Will.i.am track played on Mars using speakers from the Curiosity rover |work=news.com.au |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA had confirmed during the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] launch tweet-up on November 24, 2011 that will.i.am had partnered with NASA to deliver a song for Curiosity's landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solotravelgirl.com/nasatweetup-rock-star-will-i-am-partners-with-nasa-has-a-s-y-s-t-e-m-to-make-science-and-technology-cool/|title=#NASATweetup: Rock Star Will 1x Partners with NASA, Has a S.Y.S.T.E.M. to Make Science and Technology Cool| work = Solo Travel Girl |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate= 17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being uploaded to the rover, which landed near the equator of Mars, the song was broadcast live from the planet, completing a journey of more than 300 million miles (approximately 482 million kilometers).&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/29/william-mars-reach-for-the-stars-curiosity_n_1838826.html|title=Will.i.am &amp; Mars: 'Reach For The Stars' Beamed From Curiosity Rover|work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first song in history to be broadcast from another planet and the second song to be broadcast in space, after [[the Beatles]]' "[[Across the Universe]]" was beamed into space by NASA in 2008.&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt;

'''Script coverage''' is a [[filmmaking]] term for the analysis and grading of [[screenplay]]s, often within the "script development" department of a [[production company]].
While coverage may remain entirely verbal, it usually takes the form of a written report, guided by a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] that varies from company to company. Criteria include, but are not limited to:

* IDENTIFICATION: Title, Author, Type of Material, Locale, [[Genre]]
* LOGLINE: A one sentence summary
* COMMENT SUMMARY: A paragraph summary of the analysis
* GRADE:  ''Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor'' for categories that include characterization, premise, storyline, production values, dialogue and more
* SYNOPSIS: Summary of plot: 1-3 pages depending on script quality
* BUDGET: The script reader's estimated budget
* ANALYSIS

==Script timeline==

Script coverage is the summary and analysis of a script's plot and writing quality, used by production companies and agencies to track film and TV screenplays.  Coverage consists of a number of elements. The first is a 1-to-2-page synopsis of the script’s story highlighting the main characters and events of the tale. The second is a subjective review of the piece (typical length of which could range anywhere from 1 sentence, in short-form contest coverage, to 2 or 3 pages) which assesses the effectiveness of the screenplay’s various components—including its concept, story structure, story development, characters, dialogue, and writing style—and points out its strong points and problem areas.  The evaluation ends with a recommendation from the analyst as to what he/she feels the production entity should do with the script. This recommendation usually employs 1 of 3 terms:

•	'''Pass:''' The reader feels the script fails to make the grade in most areas and that the production entity should not proceed with it.

•	'''Consider:''' The reader feels the script has a considerable number of strong points and is good enough to proceed with, while acknowledging that it has a number of significant problems that need to be successfully solved before the piece can be considered suitable for production.

•	'''Recommend:''' The reader feels the script is extremely strong in all respects and that the production entity should proceed with it without reservation.

When completed, the synopsis, review, and evaluation are assembled and fronted with a cover page that lists the script’s vital information (author’s name, story genre, time and locations in which it takes place, length of the script, etc.) and contains a brief summary of the story and the review. The cover page usually includes a checklist in which the script’s various aspects are rated on a scale ranging from poor to excellent. Finally, the cover page highlights the analyst’s ultimate recommendation.

Although script coverage is a tool used primarily by motion picture production entities, it is sometimes used by screenwriting competitions as a way of separating "wheat from chaff." The coverage done for script competitions is usually simpler than that done for production companies—substituting a logline (a brief 1 or 2 line summary of the story) for the synopsis and simplifying the assessment—often employing only the checklist rating of the script’s various aspects.

In addition to production entities and screenwriting competitions, a number of independent services employ a roster of veteran script analysts to provide professional-level coverage for screenwriters who wish to see how their scripts will be received by the industry.This gives the writers a chance to identify and resolve problems before submitting them to production entities.

==Issues in coverage==

=== Economy of the script ===
By the very nature of summarizing a complicated plot, the coverage will not include every plot twist and subplot. Some characters will be omitted, or only briefly introduced for the sake of brevity. In order to decide on what will stay and what will go, the character and actions must support the main plot, and ultimately the premise of the story. Scripts that are not economical and include peripheral characters, scenes, and storylines that do not support character or plot development do not affect their motivation, and therefore can be omitted from the coverage. In this manner, well-written scripts may have longer synopses than poorly written scripts with a lot of extraneous action.

The '''technology of television''' has evolved since its early days using a mechanical system invented by [[Paul Gottlieb Nipkow]] in 1884. Every television system works on the scanning principle first implemented in the rotating disk scanner of Nipkow.  This turns a two-dimensional image into a time series of signals that represent the brightness and color of each resolvable element of the picture.  By repeating a two-dimensional image quickly enough, the impression of motion can be transmitted as well. For the receiving apparatus to reconstruct the image, synchronization information is included in the signal to allow proper placement of each line within the image and to identify when a complete image has been transmitted and a new image is to follow.

While mechanically-scanned systems were experimentally used, television as a mass medium was made practical by the development of electronic camera tubes and displays. By the turn of the 20th century, it was technically feasible to replace the analog signals for television broadcasting with digital signals. Many television viewers no longer use an antenna to receive over-the-air broadcasts, instead relying on [[cable television]] systems.  Increasingly these are integrated with telephone and Internet services.

The elements of a simple [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] television system are:
* An image source. This is the electrical signal representing the visual image, and may be from a [[professional video camera]] in the case of [[live television]], a [[video tape recorder]] for playback of recorded images, or [[telecine]] with a [[flying spot scanner]] for the transfer of [[motion picture]]s to video).
* A sound source. This is an electrical signal from a [[microphone]] or from the audio output of a [[video tape recorder]].
* A [[transmitter]], which generates [[radio]] signals ([[radio]] waves) and encodes them with picture and sound information.
* A [[television antenna]] coupled to the output of the [[transmitter]] for [[broadcasting]] the encoded signals.
* A television antenna to receive the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] signals.
* A receiver (also called a [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner]]), which decodes the picture and sound information from the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] signals, and whose input is coupled to the antenna of the [[television set]].
* A [[display device]], which turns the electrical signals into visual images.
* An [[sound|audio]] [[amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]], which turns electrical signals into sound waves (speech, music, and other sounds) to accompany the images.

Practical television systems include equipment for selecting different image sources, mixing images from several sources at once, insertion of pre-recorded video signals, synchronizing signals from many sources, and direct image generation by [[computer]] for such purposes as station identification. The facility for housing such equipment, as well as providing space for stages, sets, offices, etc., is called a [[television studio]], and may be located many miles from the [[transmitter]]. Communication from the studio to the [[transmitter]] is accomplished via a dedicated cable or [[radio]] system.

Television signals were originally transmitted exclusively via land-based transmitters. The quality of reception varied greatly, dependent in large part on the location and type of receiving antenna. This led to the proliferation of large rooftop antennas to improve reception in the 1960s, replacing set-top [[Dipole antenna|dipole]] or "rabbit ears" antennas, which however remained popular. [[Rotor (antenna)|Antenna rotors]], set-top controlled [[Servomechanism|servo motors]] to which the mast of the antenna is mounted, to enable rotating the antenna such that it points to the desired transmitter, would also become popular.

In most cities today, [[cable television]] providers deliver signals over [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] or [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]] cables for a fee. Signals can also be delivered by [[radio]] from [[Satellite television|satellites]] in [[geosynchronous orbit]] and received by [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antennas]], which are comparatively large for [[Analog signal|analog]] signals, but much smaller for [[Digital television|digital]]. Like cable providers, [[satellite television]] providers also require a fee, often less than cable systems. The affordability and convenience of digital satellite reception has led to the proliferation of small dish antennas outside many houses and apartments.

[[Digital electronics|Digital]] systems may be inserted anywhere in the chain to provide better image transmission quality, reduction in transmission [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], special effects, or security of transmission from reception by non-subscribers. A home today might have the choice of receiving analog or [[HDTV]] over the air, analog or digital cable with [[HDTV]] from a [[cable television]] company over [[coaxial cable]], or even from the phone company over [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optic]] lines. On the road, television can be received by pocket sized televisions, recorded on tape or digital media players, or played back on [[Mobile phone|wireless phones (mobile or "cell" phones)]] over a [[Broadband Internet access|high-speed or "broadband" internet connection]].

==Display technology==
{{further|Comparison of display technology|Large-screen television technology|Plasma display|Liquid crystal display television}}

[[File:Dv schnittplatz.JPG|thumb|[[Digital video]] equipment in an edit suite]]

There are now several kinds of video displays used in modern TV sets:

*'''CRT''' ([[cathode-ray tube]]): Up until the first decade of the 21st Century, the most common screens were direct-view CRTs for up to roughly 100&amp;nbsp;cm (40&amp;nbsp;inch) (in 4:3 ratio) and 115&amp;nbsp;cm (45&amp;nbsp;inch) (in 16:9 ratio) [[diagonal]]s.   A typical [[NTSC]] broadcast signal's visible portion has an equivalent resolution of 449 x 483 rectangular pixels.  
*'''[[Rear-projection television|Rear Projection]]''' ('''RPTV''') displays can be made in large sizes, (254&amp;nbsp;cm (100&amp;nbsp;inch) and beyond), and use [[Video projector|projection]] technology. Three types of projection systems are used in projection TVs: CRT-based, [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]]-based, and [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] (reflective micromirror chip) -based, [[D-ILA]] and [[LCOS]]-based. Projection television has been commercially available since the 1970s, but at that time could not match the image sharpness of the CRT.
**A variation is a '''[[video projector]]''', using similar technology, which projects onto a [[Projection screen|screen]].  This is often referred to as "front projection".
*'''[[Flat panel display]]''' ([[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] or [[Plasma display|plasma]]): Flat panels television sets use [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix]] LCD or plasma display technology. Flat panel LCDs and plasma displays are as little as 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;inch) thick and can be hung on a wall like a picture or put over a [[pedestal]]. Some models can also be used as [[Visual display unit|computer monitors]].
*'''[[Light-emitting diode|LED]]''' (light-emitting diode) arrays (not to be confused with the LED backlighting used behind some LCD panels consequently advertised as "LED") became the favored technology for large outdoor video and stadium screens after the advent of very bright LEDs and the matrix driver electronics for them. They make possible ultra-large flat panel video displays that other technologies are currently not able to match in performance.
*'''[[OLED]]''' (organic light-emitting diode) technology is currently (2017) used mainly for [[smartphone]] screens, but larger OLED screens are expected to proliferate as prices for them continue to fall. Unlike LCD panels, OLED screens are viewable from extreme angles, are free from pixel lag, and offer a very high contrast ratio comparable to CRT displays, with very deep blacks. They can be extremely thin and lightweight and can, at least in prototype, be made flexible enough to roll up when not in use.

Each has its pros and cons. Front projection and plasma displays have a wide viewing angle (nearly 180 degrees) so they may be best for a home theater with a wide seating arrangement. Rear projection screens do not perform well in daylight or well-lit rooms and so are only suitable for darker viewing areas.

== Terminology for televisions ==
Pixel [[Display resolution|resolution]] is the number of [[pixels]] of one row on a given screen. Before the year 2000 ''horizontal lines of resolution'' was the standard method of measurement for analog video. For example, a VHS VCR might be described as having 250 lines of resolution as measured across a circle circumscribed in the center of the screen (approximately 440 pixels edge-to-edge). With analog signals, the number of vertical lines and the [[frame rate]] are directly proportional to the bandwidth of the signal transmitted.

A typical resolution of 720×480 and 720x576 means that the television display has 720 pixels across and 480 or 576&amp;nbsp;pixels on the vertical axis. The higher the resolution on a specified display the sharper the image. Contrast [[ratio]] is a measurement of the range between the lightest and darkest points on the screen.

The higher the contrast ratio, the better looking picture there is in terms of richness, deepness, and [[shadow]] detail. The [[brightness]] of a picture measures how vibrant and impacting the colors are. Measured in &lt;math&gt;cd/m^2&lt;/math&gt; equivalent to the number of candles required to power the [[image]].

On the other hand, the so-called ''brightness'' and ''contrast'' adjustment controls on televisions and monitors are traditionally used to control different aspects of the picture display. The brightness control shifts the black level, affecting the image intensity or brightness, while the contrast control adjusts the contrast range of the image.&lt;ref&gt;John Watkinson, ''Convergence in Broadcast and Communications Media: The Fundamentals of Audio, Video, Data'', Focal Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-240-51509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission band==
There are various bands on which televisions operate depending upon the country. The [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] signals in bands III to V are generally used. Lower frequencies do not have enough [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] available for television.

Countries with 60&amp;nbsp;Hz [[utility frequency|power line frequency]] use frame rates very near 30 per second, while 50&amp;nbsp;Hz regions use 25 frames per second. These rates were chosen to minimize distortion of pictures that could be produced in analog receivers. For a given frame rate, an analog signal with 400 lines per frame would use less bandwidth than one with 600 or 800 lines per frame.  Higher bandwidth makes receiver design more complicated, requires higher radio frequencies to be used, and may limit the number of channels that can be allocated in a given area; the same radio frequencies useful for television are also in high demand for other services such as aviation, land mobile radio, and mobile telephones.

Although the [[BBC]] initially used Band I VHF at 45&amp;nbsp;MHz, this frequency is (in the UK) no longer in use for this purpose. Band II is used for FM radio transmissions. Higher frequencies behave more like light and do not penetrate buildings or travel around obstructions well enough to be used in a conventional broadcast TV system, so they are generally only used for [[MMDS]] and [[satellite television]], which uses frequencies from 2 to 12&amp;nbsp;GHz. TV systems in most countries relay the video as an AM ([[amplitude-modulation]]) signal and the sound as an FM ([[frequency-modulation]]) signal. An exception is [[France]], where the sound is AM.

==Aspect ratios==
'''[[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratio]]''' refers to the ratio of the horizontal to vertical measurements of a television's picture. Mechanically scanned television as first demonstrated by [[John Logie Baird]] in 1926 used a 7:3 vertical aspect ratio, oriented for the head and shoulders of a single person in close-up.

Most of the early electronic TV systems, from the mid-1930s onward, shared the same [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 4:3 which was chosen to match the [[Academy ratio|Academy Ratio]] used in cinema films at the time. This ratio was also square enough to be conveniently viewed on round [[cathode ray tube|cathode-ray tubes]] (CRTs), which were all that could be produced given the [[manufacturing]] [[technology]] of the time. (Today's CRT technology allows the manufacture of much wider tubes, and the flat-screen technologies which are becoming steadily more popular have no technical aspect ratio limitations at all.) The [[BBC]]'s television service used a more squarish [https://archive.is/20030627160926/http://tcc.members.beeb.net/tchistory.html 5:4] ratio from 1936 to [https://web.archive.org/web/20140330182707/http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/Test-Cards/Test-Card-Technical.html#Aspect-Ratio 3 April 1950], when it too switched to a 4:3 ratio. This did not present significant problems, as most sets at the time used round tubes which were easily adjusted to the 4:3 ratio when the transmissions changed.

[[File:Samsung LE26R41BD and Yamada DVD player 20030624.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] LE26R41BD [[High-definition television|HDTV]]]]
In the early 1950s, [[movie studio]]s moved towards [[widescreen]] aspect ratios such as [[CinemaScope]] in an effort to distance their product from television. Although this was initially just a [[gimmick]], widescreen is still the format of choice today and 4:3 aspect ratio movies are rare.

Yet the various television systems were not originally designed to be compatible with film at all. Traditional, narrow-screen movies are projected onto a television camera either so that the top of the screens line up to show facial features, or, for films with subtitles, the bottoms. What this means is that filmed newspapers or long captions filling the screen for explanation are cut off at each end. Similarly, while the frame rate of sound films is 24 per second, the screen scanning rate of the NTSC is 29.97 [[Hertz|Hz]] (per second), which requires a complex scanning schedule. That of PAL and SECAM are 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, which means that films are shortened (and the sound is offkey) by scanning each frame twice for 25 per second.

The switch to [[digital television]] systems has been used as an opportunity to change the standard television picture format from the old ratio of 4:3 (1.33:1) to an aspect ratio of 16:9 (approximately 1.78:1). This enables TV to get closer to the aspect ratio of modern widescreen [[film|movies]], which range from 1.66:1 through 1.85:1 to 2.35:1. There are two methods for transporting widescreen content, the most common of which uses what is called [[full screen anamorphic|anamorphic widescreen]] format. This format is very similar to the technique used to fit a widescreen movie frame inside a 1.33:1 35&amp;nbsp;mm film frame. The image is compressed horizontally when recorded, then expanded again when played back. The anamorphic widescreen 16:9 format was first introduced via European [[PALplus]] television broadcasts and then later on "widescreen" Laser Discs and [[DVD]]s; the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] [[High-definition television|HDTV]] system uses straight widescreen format, no horizontal compression or expansion is used.

Recently "widescreen" has spread from television to computing where both [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop]] computers are commonly equipped with widescreen displays. There are some complaints about distortions of movie picture ratio due to some DVD playback software not taking account of aspect ratios; but this may subside as the DVD playback software matures. Furthermore, computer and laptop widescreen displays are in the 16:10 aspect ratio both physically in size and in pixel counts, and not in 16:9 of consumer televisions, leading to further complexity. This was a result of widescreen computer display engineers' assumption that people viewing 16:9 content on their computer would prefer that an area of the screen be reserved for playback controls, [[subtitles]] or their Taskbar, as opposed to viewing content full-screen.

===Aspect ratio incompatibility===

The television industry's changing of [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]] is not without difficulties, and can present a considerable problem.

Displaying a widescreen aspect (rectangular) image on a conventional aspect (square or 4:3) display can be shown:
*in "[[letterbox]]" format, with black horizontal bars at the top and bottom
*with part of the image being cropped, usually the extreme left and right of the image being cut off (or in "[[pan and scan]]", parts selected by an operator or a viewer)
*with the image horizontally compressed

A conventional aspect (square or 4:3) image on a widescreen aspect (rectangular with longer horizon) display can be shown:
*in "[[pillar box (film)|pillar box]]" format, with black vertical bars to the left and right
*with upper and lower portions of the image cut off (or in "tilt and scan", parts selected by an operator)
*with the image vertically compressed

A common compromise is to shoot or create material at an aspect ratio of 14:9, and to lose some image at each side for 4:3 presentation, and some image at top and bottom for 16:9 presentation. In recent years, the cinematographic process known as [[Super 35]] (championed by [[James Cameron]]) has been used to film a number of major movies such as [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']], ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'', and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''. This process results in a camera-negative which can then be used to create both wide-screen theatrical prints, and standard "[[Fullscreen (cinema)|full screen]]" releases for television/VHS/DVD which avoid the need for either "[[letterbox]]ing" or the severe loss of information caused by conventional "[[pan-and-scan]]" cropping.

{{main|Digital switchover}}

=== NTSC ===
{{update|section|date=November 2010}}
In North America, the basic signal standards since 1941 had been compatible enough in 2007 that even the oldest monochrome televisions could still receive color broadcasts. However, the United States Congress passed a law which required the cessation of all conventional television broadcast signals by February 2009. After that date all [[NTSC]] standard televisions with analog-only tuners went dark unless fitted with a digital [[ATSC tuner]].  The digital channels occupy the same spectrum as the analog channels.  Some of the spectrum previously occupied by the highest numbered channels was auctioned off by the United States' Federal Communications Commission for other uses.

=== PAL and SECAM ===
[[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] are expected not to be broadcast in Europe and Eurasia by the mid-2020s. PAL-M may have a similar decommissioning timeline.

The [[European Union]] has recommended its members to close down analogue terrestrial television by 2012. Luxembourg and the Netherlands already completed their closedowns in 2006, and Finland and Sweden closed down their analogue broadcasts in 2007.

Britain started its digital switch in October 2007. At 2{{nbsp}}am on Wednesday 17 October 2007, the BBC2 transmitter covering the Whitehaven and Copeland areas (NW England) was disabled. The remaining four analogue channels ceased broadcasting shortly after. The original five channels are now available only in digital form, alongside approximately 15 additional free-to-air channels.

== Exterior designs ==
In the early days of television, cabinets were made of wood grain (often simulated particularly in the later years), however, they went out of style in the 1980s. Up until the late 1970s, console TV/Hi Fi's were common. These were large (about 6' wide by 4' high) wooden cabinets containing a television, speakers, [[radio]] and a [[phonograph|turntable]].

'''Tom Wham''' (born 1944 in [[Chester, Illinois]]) is a [[game designer|designer]] of [[board game]]s who has also produced artwork, including that for his own games.

==Career==
===Early life and Guidon Games===
Wham worked a variety of odd jobs during his early adult life.

===TSR===
In May 1977 he began working for [[TSR, Inc.]] at their [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] headquarters as a general office worker, the company's 13th employee.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; After running the Dungeon Hobby Shop for a summer, he was moved upstairs to the company's art department.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Wham worked with [[David C. Sutherland III|Dave Sutherland]] and [[Dave Trampier]] on the original ''[[Monster Manual]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Wham began doing some creative work for the company, contributing a handful of illustrations for the original [[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]] ''[[Monster Manual]]'', including the creature called the [[Beholder (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|beholder]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #40" /&gt; He also made a deal with [[Tim Kask]], editor of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'', to do a game in the centerfold, called ''Snit Smashing''; this led to other games in ''Dragon'', including ''[[The Awful Green Things From Outer Space]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; These games, printed on cardstock and included in the centerfold of the magazine, usually featured artwork supplied by Wham.

Notable games published this way include:

* ''Snit Smashing'':  Originally published in ''Dragon'' #10 (October 1977). In Wham's first game for ''Dragon'', tiny creatures known as Snits run out from the sea and try to procreate while avoiding the giant blob-like Bolotomi, who smash the Snits out of boredom. Players alternate control between the Snits and the Bolotomus, attempting to make their own Snits reproduce faster than those of their opponent.
* ''[[Snit's Revenge]]'':  Originally published in ''Dragon'' #11 (December 1977). In the more famous follow-up to ''Snit Smashing'', the Snits set out to finally kill the elephantine Bolotomi who are smashing them, by invading their bodies and shutting down all their internal organs. This was published as a separate boardgame by TSR in 1978, and is now published by [[Steve Jackson Games]].
* ''[[The Awful Green Things From Outer Space]]'': Originally published in ''Dragon'' #28 (August 1979).  A game of green aliens invading a spaceship.  This too was eventually published as a separate game by TSR and later published by Steve Jackson Games as well.
* ''Search for the Emperor's Treasure'': Originally published in ''Dragon'' #51 (July 1981).  Players take the roles of adventurers searching a fantasy empire for the emperor's scattered magical treasures.  A revised edition was included in a box set called "The Best of Dragon Games", 1990.
* ''[[File 13 (board game)|File 13]]'': Originally published in ''Dragon'' #72 (April 1983). A game about designing board games. A second edition was reissued in "The Best of Dragon Games".
* ''King of the Tabletop'': Originally published in ''Dragon'' #77 (September 1983), this is a game in which people create their own kingdom from little cardboard [[Chit (board wargames)|chits]] representing land, characters, and events. Also expanded and published commercially as ''Kings and Things'' by [[West End Games]], [[Games Workshop]], and later, in a German edition, Pegasus Spiele.
* ''Elefant Hunt'': Originally published in ''Dragon'' #88 (August 1984). Great White Hunters travel through deepest, darkest "Aferca" with the help of natives to capture as much live animals and ivory as they can to sell for profit.

===After TSR===
After TSR, Wham collaborated on books with [[Rose Estes]], and did his own novelette in [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''[[The Exotic Enchanter]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; More games followed, including ''[[Kings &amp; Things]]'' (with [[Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]]), the ''[[Sim City: The Card Game|SimCity]]'' card game, and ''[[Iron Dragon (board game)|Iron Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; More recent efforts include a reprint of ''Snits'' from [[Steve Jackson Games]], and ''Planet Busters'' by [[Troll Lord Games]].&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt;

Wham designed the board game "King of the Tabletop" with [[Robert J.

'''Tom show''' is a general term for any [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[Musical theatre|musical]] based (often only loosely) on the 1852 novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of [[slavery]]. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term "[[Uncle Tom]]".

Even though ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/e_cabin.html "People &amp; Events: Uncle Tom's Cabin Takes the Nation by Storm"] ''Stephen Foster'', The American Experience, PBS, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these shows were essentially [[minstrel shows]] that utilized caricatures and [[stereotype]]s of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. "Tom shows" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.

== The shows ==

Stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&amp;mdash;"Tom shows"&amp;mdash;began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics&amp;mdash;some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.&lt;ref name="lott"&gt;Lott, Eric. ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-507832-2}}. The information on "Tom shows" comes from chapter 8: ''Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production'', pp.&amp;nbsp;211–233&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the productions also featured songs by [[Stephen Foster]], including "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]," "[[Old Folks at Home]]," and "Massa's in the Cold Ground."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was "delighted" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Asa Hutchinson of the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]], whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.

Eric Lott, in his book ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just [[blackface]] [[minstrel shows]] only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.&lt;ref name="lott" /&gt;

== Productions ==

[[File:Eliza-Crossing-the-Ice-Morgan-1881.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Eliza crossing the ice, in an 1881 theater poster for a production by the Jarrett &amp; London Company and Slavin's Original American Troupe.]]

All "Tom shows" appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].

The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by [[Charles W. Taylor|C.W. Taylor]] at [[Chatham Theatre|Purdy's National Theater]] (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August&amp;ndash;September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring [[T.D. Rice]]. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly [[racism|racist]] blackface character [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in January 1854 at New York's [[Bowery Theatre]], the ''[[Spirit of the Times]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' reviewer described him as "decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama."

The best-known "Tom Shows" were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and [[H.J. Conway]].&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt;

Aiken's original ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star [[Cordelia Howard]]); a sequel, ''The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely'' told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his defiant speech received "great cheers" from an audience of Bowery [[b'hoy and g'hal|b'hoys and g'hals]]. Even this most sympathetic of "Tom shows" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in [[Troy, New York]], the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater.

Conway's production opened in [[Boston]] the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; [[P.T. Barnum]] brought it to his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, "buffoons". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced [[Yankee]] character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a [[John C. Calhoun]]. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the ''normal'' mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.

Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.

== Diluting the message of Stowe's book ==

"Tom shows" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom'', produced in 1852 at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] Museum.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Lott mentions numerous "offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals" including a full-scale play by [[Christy's Minstrels]] and a parody by Conway himself called ''Uncle Pat's Cabin'', and records that the story in its many variants "dominated northern popular culture… for several years".

According to Eric Lott, even those "Tom shows" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the [[feminism|feminist]] aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism.&lt;ref name="lott"/&gt; Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the "lightness and gayety" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).

== Influence ==

The influence of the "Tom shows" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's ''Dred'', but also [[J.T. Trowbridge]]'s abolitionist play ''Neighbor Jackwood'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Octoroon]]'', and a play called ''The Insurrection'', based on [[John Brown (abolitionist)#Raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].

[[File:1903UncleTomFilm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the first "full length" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child.]]

The influence of the "Tom shows" also carried over into the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and "Tom shows," meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.&lt;ref name="Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film"/&gt;

Several of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of "Tom shows." These included:

* A 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the earliest "full-length" movies (although "full-length" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"/&gt;
*Another film version from 1903 was directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starred Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. While no copies of Lubin's film still exist, according to accounts the movie was similar to Porter's version and reused the sets and costumes from a "Tom Show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/lubinhp.html "Duping" Porter: Sigmund Lubin's Production (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As cinema replaced [[vaudeville]] and other types of live variety entertainment, "Tom shows" slowly disappeared. [[J.C. Furnas]], in his book ''Goodbye to Uncle Tom'', stated that he had seen a production in the 1920s in Ohio; the last touring group specializing in "Tomming" he could locate was apparently operating as late as the 1950s.

The term "'''trope'''" is both a term which denotes [[figurative language|figurative]] and [[metaphor]]ical language and one which has been used in various technical senses. The term ''trope'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τρόπος (''tropos''), "a turn, a change",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*t%3Aentry+group%3D23%3Aentry%3Dtro%2Fpos τρόπος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus ]&lt;/ref&gt; related to the root of the verb τρέπειν (''trepein''), "to turn, to direct, to alter, to change";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | chapter = trope | year = 2009 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trope | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; this means that the term is used metaphorically to denote, among other things, metaphorical language. Perhaps the term can be explained as meaning the same thing as ''a turn of phrase'' in its original sense.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The term is also used in technical senses, which do not always correspond to its linguistic origin. Its meaning has to be judged from the [[Context (language use)|context]], some of which are given below.

==Basic meaning as metaphor==
Here a trope is a figurative and metaphorical use of a word or a phrase. The verb ''to trope'' means then to make a trope.

==Greek philosophy==
{{Main article|Sextus Empiricus}}
A trope or mode is one of the ten skeptical arguments or "ways of refuting [[dogmatism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, E.S.C. ; Simpson, J.A. (1992), ''The Compact Oxford English Dictionary'', New York: Clarendon Press, p.581, {{ISBN|0-19-861258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Sextus Empiricus#The ten modes of Pyrrhonism|The Ten Modes of Pyrrhonism]], described by the Greek physician and philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]].

==In philosophy of history==
{{Main article|philosophy of history}}
The use of tropes has been extended from a linguistic usage to the field of [[philosophy of history]] by, among other theorists, [[Hayden White]] in his ''Metahistory'' (1973). Tropes are generally understood to be styles of [[discourse]] — rather than figures of style — underlying the historian's writing of history. They are historically determined in as much as the [[historiography]] of every period is defined by a specific type of trope.

For Hayden White, tropes historically unfolded in this sequence: [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]], and finally, [[irony]].

==Trope theory in philosophy&lt;!--'Trope theory' and 'Trope nominalism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
{{See also|Nominalism#Varieties}}
'''Trope theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (or '''trope nominalism''') in [[metaphysics]] is a version of [[nominalism]]. Here, a trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific redness of a rose, or the specific nuance of green of a leaf. Trope theories assume that [[universals]] are unnecessary. This use of the term goes back to [[D. C. Williams]] (1953). The basic problem has been discussed previously in philosophy without using the term "trope". The following is a brief background:

The basic problem is the [[problem of universals]].  One part of the problem of universals is determining what it is for two tokens (or separate instances of something) to be of the same type. How can different things be the same? The arguments are complex, and involve [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. Part of the problem would be determining what it is for six different green objects to all be the same in respect to their color.

One classical solution is that of [[Problem of universals#Realism|realism]] as found in the middle period of [[Plato]]'s philosophy, with the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' as a crowning work. According to this solution there are [[idea]]s or [[substantial form|forms]] for any property. These forms exist timelessly as singular, perfect individuals in a metaphysical (timeless, supra-sensible) world of their own. They correspond to what is later called [[universals]]. Somehow the form of a specific color creates many secondary images of itself, as when a prototype is used to make copies or an object casts several shadows. Expressed more abstractly the individual colour-instances (the green of this leaf, the similar green of this frog) all partake in the same idea of green. In Plato the [[theory of forms]] is related to his theses about [[innate knowledge]]. In ''[[Phaedo]]'' the turn of the argument is that we cannot learn from experience what similarity is through [[abstraction]], but must possess it in an innate form before we have any experience (''Phaedo'' 74a-75d).

Nevertheless, Plato in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' dialogue himself formulated several problems for his view. One is: How can the idea, being single, nevertheless be present in a multitude of separate instances without being split apart.

The other solution is that of [[nominalism]]. Here the thesis is that universals such as the [[idea]]s or [[substantial form|form]]s of [[Plato]] are unnecessary in an explanation of language, thought and the world. Only single individuals are real, but they can be grouped together by a human observer through their similarities. Nominalists are usually [[empiricists]]. [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], for example, argued against [[universals]] or [[Abstract object|abstract]] objects using nominalistic arguments. He used the term [[idea]] to denote specific perceptions of an atomistic nature. They could be grouped through similarities or one could take a specific instance, for example the green hue of this frog one is looking at now, as a kind of paradigm case or prototype, and regard everything that was similar to it as belonging to the same type or category. One attraction of the nominalistic program is that if it can be carried out it solves Plato's problem in [[Parmenides]], since the need for a single idea or form or universal ''green'' then vanishes and it can be expunged through [[Occam's razor]], i.e. the rule that, other things being equal, one should not multiply explanatory entities beyond necessity.

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1912, chapter IX) argued against Berkeley and took the same basic position as Plato. His argument was basically one against any form of [[nominalism]]. It says, briefly, that if we introduce several instances of green as separate individuals, we nevertheless have to accept that the reason that we group them together is because they are similar. Therefore, we must presume at least one true universal, that of similarity.

Two popular recent solutions to the problem of universals, as it relates to the possibility of entities existing in multiple locations at the same time, are as follows.

[[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], a prominent Australian philosopher, argues, that there are instantiated universals, like Russell and the middle Plato. Briefly, an instantiated universal is a property (such as being green) that can exist in multiple locations at the same time. Going back to the problem of universals, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to instantiate the universal green. The very same, identical universal green would be wholly located at each green object. To be even more specific, if a frog and a leaf are the same shade of green, the green of the frog and the green of the leaf are one and the same entity (qua green-ness), which happens to be multiply located.

D. C. Williams and [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]], among others, reject instantiated universals in favor of tropes. Briefly, a trope is a property (such as being green) that can only exist in one location at one time. Trope theorists explain what it is for two tokens (individual instances) to be of the same type in terms of resemblance. As an example, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to have its own distinct green trope. Each green trope would be a different entity from the other green tropes, but they would ''resemble'' each other and would all be taken to be green because of their resemblance. 

A metaphysical doctrine embracing both tropes and the objects on which the tropes depend was elaborated by [[Edmund Husserl]] in his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl) | Logical Investigations]]'', as part of what Husserl called 'formal ontology'. Husserl's ideas in this respect were used as the basis for the theory of [[Truthmaker | truthmaking]] put forward by Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith in ''Truthmakers'' (1984) &lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, K., Simons, P. M. and Smith B., "[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/truthmakers/tm.pdf Truth-Makers]", ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 44 (1984), 287–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory it is tropes -- including both individual qualities and events -- that serve as the truthmakers for true atomic sentences such as 'John is hot' or 'Mary is loved by John' or 'John kicked Bill'.

'''Ultimate Challenge MMA''' (also referred to as '''UCMMA''') is a [[mixed martial arts]] promotion based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is shown live on [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]] in the UK, [[Fight Now TV]] in the USA and on [[Viewster]] in several other countries.

==History==

The collapse of [[EliteXC]] was quickly followed by [[Cage Rage]] with its final show Cage Rage 28 in 2008.  Later that same year [[Dave O'Donnell (MMA promoter)|Dave O'Donnell]], one of the original owners of Cage Rage, created Ultimate Challenge UK.  Their first event 'Bad Breed' covered the spot where Cage Rage 29 was going to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ultimate Challenge UK: Bad Breed|work= MMA Universe|date=|url= http://www.mmauniverse.com/events/ultimate-challenge-uk-bad-breed&amp;d=ar|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a while of promoting many successful events, UCUK dropped the 'UK' out of the name and replaced it with 'MMA' becoming 'UCMMA'.  UCMMA has been steadily approaching the same popularity that [[Cage Rage]] once enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaprospectsuk.com/features/exclusive-interviews/132-interview-with-dave-odonnell |title=Interview with Dave O'Donnell |publisher=Mmaprospectsuk.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After White Collar MMA 6 (WCMMA), UK casting call were taken place at the Troxy for a new American reality show - Warrior Island. Dave O'Donnell hosted the casting call at the request by Global Proving Ground (GPG) President, James Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= DAVE O’DONNELL SET TO HOST U.K. CASTING CALL FOR GPG REALITY SHOW ‘WARRIOR ISLAND’|work= themmareview.co.uk|date=|url= http://www.themmareview.co.uk/2012/09/dave-oconnell-set-to-host-u-k-casting-call-for-gpg-reality-show-warrior-island}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reality show will be directed by Hollywood veteran Ben Perry.

SAFE MMA, which officially launches Jan. 1 2013, also will provide affordable, standardized blood and medical tests for all registered fighters, as well as advice from leading world experts in sports medicine, according to today's announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/31287/cage-warriors-bamma-and-ucmma-unite-for-mma-safe-fighter-safety-initiative.mma|title=Cage Warriors, BAMMA and UCMMA unite for MMA SAFE fighter-safety initiative |publisher=mmajunkie.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/BAMMA-UCMMA-CWFC-Form-MMA-SAFE-Program-to-Improve-Fighter-Safety-in-UK-46809|title=BAMMA, UCMMA, CWFC FORM MMA SAFE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE FIGHTER SAFETY IN U.K. |publisher=sherdog.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sky Sports cut out all MMA programming from their channels, UCMMA announced that they signed a deal with on-demand channel Primetime for a live broadcasting partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Dann |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/ucmma-announces-primetime-deal-uk-1539466 |title=UCMMA announces Primetime deal: UK MMA promotion to be televised live via on-demand channel |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cage Fighter===

They show their chat show, Cage Fighter, every Wednesday night on [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muscletalk.co.uk/Sky-Sports-4-1000pm-Cage-Fighter-Muscle-Finesse-Sponsored-Pro-Jimi-Manuwa-m4613839.aspx |title=Sky Sports 4 10.00pm: Cage Fighter - Muscle Finesse Sponsored Pro Jimi Manuwa! |publisher=Muscletalk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave O'Donnell hosts the 30 minute show with Grant Waterman and interviews MMA fighters, shows clips of previous fights, GYM of the week, KO/Submission of the week and advertises their next event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UCMMA and Sky Sports partner up for Cage Fighter |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/wrestling-wwe-ufc-mma/2010/07/ucmma-and-sky-sports-partner-u.html |title=UCMMA and Sky Sports partner up for Cage Fighter - TKO - Mirror.co.uk's MMA Blog |publisher=Blogs.mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK1===

UCMMA also shows [[kickboxing]] matches during their events, referring to them as 'UK1', named after the well known [[K-1]] kickboxing company based in [[Japan]]. Because they hold these fights in the same events as they show MMA, the kickboxers use the cage to compete in.

Each fight will be a three 3 minute round with a minute rest period in between rounds, and if it’s a draw one more round will be fought. Each round will be scored using the 10-point must system. Fighters using the most effective aggression and effective technique will win the round. Also the three knock-down rule applies, and a fighter can only be saved from a count by the bell in the final round. the choice to use MMA gloves or standard kickboxing gloves are agreed to by both fighters. Because of the pace of the action, if fighters get into a clinch they will be allowed a single knee strike and then must break clean. If the referee says ‘break’ they must not hit on the break. Rules are set so that certain things that are allowed in MMA are not used in the UK1 bouts, such as standing/clinching elbow strikes, ground fighting (grappling or striking), trips, takedowns or throws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullmount.co.uk/index.php/mma-news/1-latest-news/1348-ucmma-22-tom-qkongq-watson-talks-uk-1-bout |title=UCMMA 22: Tom "Kong" Watson Talks UK-1 Bout - MMA News &amp; MMA Video - Full Mount MMA - Mixed Martial Arts Network |publisher=Fullmount.co.uk |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its first bouts, it has gained popularity, as it makes their fight card more exciting and keeps the audience entertained if the prior fights were boring due to slow pace striking or grappling. It also allows the company to reach the type of audience that dislikes the use of small 6oz MMA gloves, grappling and striking to a grounded opponent. There are also titles in each weight division, which follows the same as their MMA divisions.

===White Collar MMA (WCMMA)===

Dave O'Donnell created White Collar MMA (WCMMA), with the idea that ''"gives the average man the chance to experience the thrill of hand to hand combat inside the octagon. Competing in the disciplines of boxing, kick boxing, Muay Thai and MMA, WCMMA lets nine to fivers take the frustrations of the office out on the man to stands toe – 2 - toe with them in the cage."'' He says: ‘Every man who sits behind his desk at work watches MMA fights on YouTube or at home on TV can now give it a go. WCMMA gives that man the chance to live the dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartlidge |first=Ben |url=http://bencartlidgesupermma.blogspot.com/2011/04/wcmma-caveman-vs-cavalier.html |title=Ben Cartlidge: Super North Star MMA: WCMMA: The Caveman vs. The Cavalier |publisher=Bencartlidgesupermma.blogspot.com |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These guys will compete against each other in three 90 seconds rounds in a safe and controlled environment putting their skills to the test in a safe arena against fellow nine to fivers.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cage Rage presents white collar mma 2 results|work= MMA Pundit|date=|url= http://mmapundit.co.uk/2011/11/12/cage-rage-presents-white-collar-mma-2-results|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave will make sure that all fights are fair and each competitor is in the right condition to fight. There will not be cost cuts on production will give them the opportunity to make their dreams come true. This will be their chance to become [[Rocky]] for one night. They will also hold amateur and semi-pro fights as well to allow amateur mixed martial artists a chance to grow their skills before going professional.

===Ultimate Ball===

UCMMA created a new sport inside MMA during the early part of 2012 called 'Ultimate Ball'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ULTIMATE BALL; UCMMA FOUNDERS MIX RUGBY WITH MMA TO CREATE NEW GAME|work= MMA Fights|date=|url= http://mma-fights.co.uk/videos/ultimate-ball-ucmma-founders-mix-rugby-with-mma-to-create-new-game/|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130505030509/http://mma-fights.co.uk/videos/ultimate-ball-ucmma-founders-mix-rugby-with-mma-to-create-new-game/|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2013-05-05|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team-based sport, which combines sports such as [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[American football]], [[basketball]] and [[mixed martial arts]], is played in the cage in which both sides try to get the rugby-shaped ball into the opposition's goal, with takedowns and body shots allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Dave O’Donnell defends Ultimate Ball, states it will be successful|work= The Fight Lounge|date=|url= http://www.thefightlounge.co.uk/dave-odonnell-defends-ultimate-ball-states-it-will-be-successful/|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate Ball debut at UCMMA 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= UCMMA Roll Out 'Ultimate Ball'|work= Your MMA|date=|url= http://www.yourmma.tv/news/details.asp/id/2090/ucmma-roll-out-ultimate-ball.htm|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= UltimateBall mixes MMA, soccer, rugby, basketball and a dash of awesome|work=Yahoo Sports|date=|url= https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/ultimateball-mixes-mma-soccer-rugby-basketball-dash-awesome-133619770.html|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept to Ultimate Ball came to [[Dave O'Donnell (MMA promoter)|Dave O'Donnell]] around the time [[Cage Rage]] was at its highest peak, but had to wait until UCMMA grew bigger to make the sport happen.

The rules to Ultimate Ball are:
# Two five-minute rounds
# If there is a draw after ten minutes, then a one-minute additional time and the first player to score wins the game.
# If after the one-minute extra time it is still a draw, it goes into penalty shootout until one time takes the lead.
# To score, the ball must stay in the net to count.
# One player can't score straight away until a teammate scores the next goal.
# The ball must be passed twice before scoring a goal.
# Four to a team, three active and one player must be sub (32-foot cage will have five players).
# A team must have different fighter from Heavyweight downwards.
# Heavyweight must be no more than 120 kilograms. 
# Subs must be Welterweight or below.
# Substitution can only be made when a player is injured or at half time.
# A red-carded player must sit out for 1 min of the game.
# Restart from the centre of the cage.
# At start of game and any restart, all players must be behind the ball.
# Strikes and takedowns are allowed when a player has the ball (push kicks, punches to body, trips, sweeps and takedowns).
# No punches on the floor, only grappling to get the ball.
# Only the referee will decide who gets the restart, i.e. the player in possession of the ball.
# If both players have the ball, referee will call a chest start (both players with chest on ball, with hands behind back until referee blows whistle to continue play).
# If the ball goes out of the cage, the other team gets the restart.
# If a player hits another player who doesn't have the ball deliberately, he will be sent off and a substitute cannot be used.
# All players must be medically checked before taking part.
# All players must wear groin and mouth guards while taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rules and Objectives of UltimateBall|work= Ultimate Ball|date=|url= http://www.ucmma.tv/ultimateball/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;layout=edit&amp;id=36|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''V.''''' is the debut [[novel]] of [[Thomas Pynchon]], published in 1963. It describes the exploits of a discharged [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailor named Benny Profane, his reconnection in [[New York City|New York]] with a group of pseudo-[[bohemianism|bohemian]] artists and hangers-on known as the Whole Sick Crew, and the quest of an aging traveler named Herbert Stencil to identify and locate the mysterious entity he knows only as "V." It was nominated for a [[National Book Award]].

==Plot summary==
The novel alternates between episodes featuring Benny, Stencil and other members of the Whole Sick Crew (including Profane's sidekick [[Pig Bodine]]) in 1956 (with a few minor flashbacks), and a generation-spanning plot that comprises Stencil's attempts to unravel the clues he believes will lead him to "V." (or to the various incarnations thereof). Each of these "Stencilised" chapters is set at a different moment of [[international crisis|historical crisis]]; the framing narrative involving Stencil, "V.", and the [[Diary|journals]] of Stencil's [[United Kingdom|British]] spy/diplomat father threads the sequences together. The novel's two storylines increasingly converge in the last chapters (the intersecting lines forming a V-shape, as it were), as Stencil hires Benny to travel with him to [[Malta]].

===Chapter One: "In which Benny Profane, a schlemil and human yo-yo, gets to an apocheir"===
The opening chapter is set in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] [[Christmas Eve]], 1955. Benny Profane, a recently discharged seaman, is at a local sailor bar called the "Sailor's Grave" in which every waitress is named Beatrice and the beer taps are rubber model breasts that the sailors suck on. Here Profane meets Ploy, a short violent sailor, his musician friend Dewey Gland, and the Maltese barmaid Paola Hod. Bar owner Mrs. Buffo begins to play a rendition of [[It Came Upon the Midnight Clear]] to celebrate Christmas only to be immediately assaulted by Ploy and the rest of the intoxicated sailors. The disorder triggers a raid by the military police. Pig Bodine, Paola, Dewey Gland and Profane escape the chaos to Pig's apartment.

===Chapter Two: "The Whole Sick Crew"===
The chapter opens with Rachel Owlglass confronting the plastic surgeon Shale Schoenmaker who she accuses of manipulating her friend and roommate Esther Havitz into debt through repeated rhinoplasty. Schoenmaker responds by entering into a monologue on the nature of Jewish women and the nature of appearance.

Section II is set during a party at Rachel's apartment attended by the "Sick Crew", Paola, Esther, and Debb. This section introduces the character Herbert Stencil, a troubled man who is obsessed with his father's mysterious death in Malta and the identity of "V", a woman mentioned in his father's journal.

===Chapter Three: "In which Stencil, a quick-change artist does eight impersonations"===
This chapter, set among the British community in [[Egypt]] toward the end of the 19th century, consists of an introduction and a series of eight relatively short sections, each of them from the point of view of a different person. The eight sections come together to tell a story of murder and intrigue, intersecting the life of a young woman, Victoria Wren, the first incarnation of V. The title is a hint as to how this chapter is to be understood: Stencil imagines each of the eight viewpoints as he reconstructs&amp;mdash;we do not know on how much knowledge and how much conjecture&amp;mdash;this episode. This chapter is a reworking of Pynchon's short story "Under the Rose", which was first published in [[1961 in literature|1961]] and is collected in ''[[Slow Learner]]'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]). In the ''Slow Learner'' introduction, Pynchon admits he took the details of the setting ("right down to the names of the diplomatic corps") from [[Karl Baedeker]]'s 1899 travel guide for Egypt. Stencil's reconstruction follows the same basic conflict as "Under the Rose", but it gives the non-European characters much more personality.

===Chapter Four: In Which Esther Gets a Nose Job===
Section I details the history of Shale Schoenmaker, M.D. and how he began his career as a plastic surgeon. During [[World War One]] he eagerly enlists in the [[American Expeditionary Forces|A.E.F.]] hoping to become a pilot but, is instead given a position as an engineer. While serving he witnesses Evan Godolphin, a handsome pilot whom he idealized, become horribly disfigured during an air raid. A month later Schoenmaker visits Godolphin in the hospital while he is recovering from reconstructive surgery, discovering that an incompetent surgeon, Halidom, treated him using the archaic method that would inevitably lead to further disfigurement by infection. This event traumatizes Schoenmaker, causing him to now see it as his mission to help people like Godolphin, a conviction that slowly decays over time.

===Chapter Five: In Which Stencil Nearly Goes West with an Alligator===
Only marginally part of the Stencil/V. material, this chapter follows Benny and others, as Benny has a job hunting [[Sewer alligator|alligators in the sewers]] under [[Manhattan]]. It figures in the Stencil/V. story in that there is a rat named "Veronica" who figures in a subplot about a mad priest — Father Linus Fairing, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] — some decades back, living in the sewers and preaching to the rats; we hear from him in the form of his diary. Stencil himself makes a brief appearance toward the end of the chapter.

===Chapter Six: In which Profane returns to street level===
The chapter follows Profane, Geronimo, Angel, and his sister Josephine "Fina" into the city over several nights of drinking. Fina and Profane's relationship develops amid concerns over her status within a local mercenary street gang known as the Playboys, who see her as a spiritual figurehead. The chapter ends amid a massive brawl, nearby which Fina is found lying naked and smiling.

===Chapter Seven: She hangs on the western wall===
In [[Florence]] in 1899, Victoria appears again, briefly, but so does the place name "Vheissu", which may or may not stand for [[Vesuvius]], [[Venezuela]], a crude interpretation of ''wie heißt du'', translating into ''who are you'' in the German language, or even (one character jokes) [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. The chapter also revolves around an attempted burglary of Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' by Hugh Godolphin through the Venezuelan consulate.

===Chapter Eight: In which Rachel gets her yo-yo back, Roony sings a song, and Stencil calls on Bloody Chiclitz===
The chapter begins with Benny Profane, freshly unemployed after being laid-off from sewer-alligator hunting, in search of a job in Manhattan. After briefly contemplating the nature of money on a park bench, he, by chance, looks at an advertisement issued by The Time/Space Employment Agency. Once arriving at the agency he finds, much to his annoyance, that the secretary is his former lover Rachel Owlglass. In section IV Stencil continues his investigation of the perplexing "V." (whom he now believes is either Victoria or the rat Veronica) meeting up with a Yoyodyne engineer Kurt Mondaugen.

===Chapter Nine: Mondaugen's story===
Kurt Mondaugen, who will appear again in ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', is the central character in a story set in [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) partly during a siege in 1922 at which one Vera Meroving is present, but most notably in 1904, during the [[Herero Wars]], when South-West Africa was a [[Germany|German]] [[colony]].

===Chapter Ten: In which various sets of young people get together===
McClintic Sphere, an alto sax player in a jazz band, returns home to his boarding house in Harlem. The previous week, spent playing primarily for condescending, snobby Ivy League students, has left him exhausted, and he relaxes in his room with a prostitute named Ruby. Benny, meanwhile, finally gets a job at Anthroresearch Associates, where he's introduced to SHROUD, a synthetic humanoid with whom he holds imaginary conversations. Pig Bodine and Roony Winsome get into a fight, based on Roony's suspicion that Pig is involved with his (Roony's) wife, Mafia. Meanwhile, Mafia aggressively pursues sex with Benny, who declines. Schoenmaker and Esther get into a few arguments because he says he wants to bring out her inner beauty by performing more plastic surgery on her. The chapter finishes out with the Whole Sick Crew hanging out in various places: Sheridan Square, the Rusty Spoon, Slab in front of his Cheese Danish No. 35 canvas. Stencil, looking for Rachel at her apartment, comes upon Paola who gives him the Confessions of Fausto Maijstral.

===Chapter Eleven: Confessions of Fausto Maijstral===
Fausto Maijstral, Maltese civilian suffering under the German bombardment and working to clear the rubble during [[World War II]] writes a long letter to his daughter Paola, who figures in the Benny Profane story; the letter comes into Stencil's hands. The letter includes copious quotations from Fausto's diary. Besides the place name [[Valletta]], V. figures in the story as an old — or possibly not-so-old — woman crushed by a beam of a fallen building.

=== Chapter Twelve: In which things are not so amusing ===
Roony and Mafia continue fighting, so Roony meets up with McClintic at the V-Note, and they travel to Lenox, Massachusetts. Returning to Matilda's boardinghouse, they meet up with Ruby, who Roony recognizes as being a member of the Crew in disguise. Esther tells Slab she is pregnant. He wants to send her to Cuba to get an abortion, and raises the money by announcing his intentions and asking for money at a party the Crew is throwing in an abandoned warehouse. Roony's attempts to deal with his wife then take a dark turn, but he is saved by Pig. At an airport, Esther and Slab attempt to catch Esther a flight to Cuba, but meet some resistance. Paola, traveling with McClintic, reveals her true identity to him. He delivers the line, "Keep cool, but care," considered the novel's central theme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nazaryan|first1=Alexander|title="V." AT L: PYNCHON’S FIRST NOVEL TURNS FIFTY|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/v-at-l-pynchons-first-novel-turns-fifty|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they drive off into the Berkshires.

=== Chapter Thirteen: In which the yo-yo string is revealed as a state of mind ===
Benny loses his job at Anthroresearch Associates by sleeping in and not being at work to notify the attendant technician that several calamities have occurred in the lab. Rachel nudges him to get a new job, and says that she will find one for him herself. An amusing story unfolds about Benny and Pig during their ''Scaffold'' days. Benny, unable and unwilling to get work, instead takes a self-described vacation and chooses to spend his spare time at the Rusty Spoon. He gets drunk with Stencil, who relates the entirety his knowledge of V. as it stands to this point in the novel. Valletta being the last place on Stencil's journey to find information about V., he asks Benny to accompany him and Paola to the island. Benny and Stencil commit a robbery in perilous circumstances, and then, in late September, they embark for Malta with Paola on board the ''Susanna Squaducci''.

===Chapter Fourteen: V. in love ===
In this chapter V. is entranced by a young ballerina, Mélanie l'Heuremaudit. The story centers on a riotous ballet performance, almost certainly modeled in part on the premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. The performance centers on a virgin sacrifice by impalement. The young ballerina fails to wear her protective equipment and actually dies by impalement in the course of the performance; everyone assumes her death throes simply to be an uncharacteristically emotional performance.

=== Chapter Fifteen: Sahha ===
Benny and Pig Bodine have one last adventure with two girls, Flip and Flop, as they all get drunk and wander around Washington D.C.. There are two going away parties for Benny, and the chapter ends with Benny, Stencil, and Paola leaving for Malta aboard the ''Susanna Squaducci'' as the Crew looks on and says goodbye.

===Chapter Sixteen: Valletta===
[[Image:KilroySchematic.svg|thumb|right|"Kilroy" schematic. Technically, a ''[[band-pass filter]]''.]] 
As the [[Royal Navy]] mass on Malta in the early stages of the [[Suez Crisis]], Stencil arrives with Benny in tow, searching for Fausto Maijstral. (As always, [[Kilroy was here]] first, and Pynchon proposes a novel origin for the face: that Kilroy was originally a [[schematic]] for part of a [[band-pass filter]].)

===Epilogue===
The last chapter is a flashback to Valletta when Stencil, Sr. was still alive. After World War I he is sent to Malta to observe the various crises going on involving the natives and their desire for independence. He is implored by Maijstral's wife (who is pregnant with Fausto)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brivic|first=Shelly|title=Tears of Rage: The Racial Interface of Modern American Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3T20043wdSAC&amp;pg=PT208&amp;lpg=PT208&amp;dq=%22carla+maijstral%22+pregnant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eRJz-nWbpT&amp;sig=_RqrFVHFzS2Oszs3g_9PGqt1NlI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carla%20maijstral%22%20pregnant&amp;f=false|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to relieve him of his duties as a double agent because she fears for his life. Stencil, Sr. meets Veronica Manganese or V and implicitly has sex with her (she is now largely made up of artificial limbs). It is revealed they had trysted in Florence after the riots. He finds out that Maijstral is having an affair with her as well.

Linus Fairing is also working as a double agent for Stencil, and when he leaves for America, having tired of the life of a spy, Stencil's purpose for being in Malta is null.

V releases Stencil from her auspices and Maijstral as well.

Stencil sails off into the Mediterranean and a waterspout blows the ship up into the air, then down into the depths, not too dissimilar from the conclusion of another American masterpiece, [[Moby-Dick]], also a sailor's story.

===Minor characters===
* Angel – Puerto Rican sewer alligator hunter and friend of Profane
* Fina – Angel's sister, she acts as a saint to the Playboy gang, often quelling disputes between them and other gangs over territory. In chapter six it is heavily implied that she is raped by the same gang.

* Raoul
* Debb Sensay
* Brad
* Roony Winsome
* Mafia Winsome
* Paola Maijstral – [[Maltese people|Maltese]] immigrant who Profane estimates to be roughly sixteen. Sometime during World War II, Paolo marries Pappy Hod to gain entrance to the United States.
* Esther Harvitz – Rachel's Jewish roommate whom Rachel financially supports.
* McClintic Sphere
* Ferguson Mixolydian – An "Irish Armenian Jew" and the "laziest living being in Nueva York". Ferguson is so lethargic that the only activity that he takes part in excluding television is once a week "to fiddle around at the kitchen sink with dry cells, retorts, alembics, salts solutions."

Scaffold where he operated a pornographic lending library and would write fetish erotica using the ship telegraph. Bodine's knees have the odd ability to lock in place allowing him to effectively sleep while standing, much to the astonishment of the navy physicians.
* Kurt Mondaugen – A engineer who works at Yoyodyne who is interviewed by Stencil.

==Analysis and Reception==
[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] wrote "In this sort of book, there is no total to arrive at. Nothing makes any waking sense. But it makes a powerful, deeply disturbing dream sense. Nothing in the book seems to have been thrown in arbitrarily, merely to confuse, as is the case when inept authors work at illusion. Pynchon appears to be indulging in the fine, pre-Freudian luxury of dreams dreamt for the dreaming. The book sails with majesty through caverns measureless to man. What does it mean? Who, finally, is V.? Few books haunt the waking or the sleeping mind, but this is one. Who, indeed?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870237,00.html Time Magazine:  ''A Myth of Alligators'', Review of Thomas Pynchon's ''V.'', Friday, Mar. 15, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Tanner considered the novel an exploration of the plots individuals ascribe onto the ambivalent universe they have no choice but to confront, during a 20th century period in which genuine communication between individuals has been eroded and in which ambiguous societal forces are at work (intentionally or inadvertently) towards a state of entropy; "SHROUD asks, "''Has it occurred to you there may be no more standards for crazy or sane, now that it's started?''" And Benny answers, "''What, for Christ's sake?''" What the 'it' is that has started (if there is an 'it'), what common process links remote imperialist incidents with contemporary automation, tourism, Hitler, and the Whole Sick Crew (if there is any linking common process) - this is what the whole book is about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tanner |first1=Tony |title=City of Words |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. |location=49 East 33rd Street, New York, NY |page=156-162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', George Plimpton called Pynchon "a young writer of staggering promise", lauding his "vigorous and imaginative style", "robust humor" and "tremendous reservoir of information".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/18/reviews/pynchon-v.html?_r=2 New York Times: Books, Pynchon's V., May 18, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the novel was awarded a [[William Faulkner Foundation Award]] for best [[debut novel]].

==Editions==
In 2012 it emerged that there were multiple versions of ''V.'' in circulation. This was due to the fact that Pynchon's final modifications were made after the first edition was printed and thus were only implemented in the British, or Jonathan Cape, edition and the Bantam paperback. The fact was forgotten soon after in the U.S., so most US editions, including the newly released eBook, follow the first printing and are therefore unauthorized versions of the text, while the British editions, which follow the first edition printed by Jonathan Cape, contain Pynchon's final revisions.&lt;ref name=TwoVs&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rolls | first1 = Albert | title = The Two ''V.''s of Thomas Pynchon, or from Lippincott to Jonathan Cape and Beyond | doi = 10.7766/orbit.v1.1.33 | journal = Orbit: Writing Around Pynchon | volume = 1 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13334">'''[[Video gaming]]''' is a young sector in '''[[Kenya]]'''. Though various start-up companies have appeared in the country since 2007, the existing businesses are dealing with funding issues and few successes have been made. However, shared spaces, support programs and government grants introduced over the past few years have allowed the industry to grow large in a short period of time. The introduction of [[broadband internet]] in 2009 spawned a generation of young [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] savvy people in the country and the Kenyan game industry is as of 2015 among the largest in Africa.&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/3/4483276/kenya-games-industry|title=Big Game: The Birth of Kenya's Game Industry|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BizAble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizable.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158:video-gaming-opens-revenue-doors-for-tech-savvy-entrepreneurs&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=119|title=Video gaming opens revenue doors for tech savvy entrepreneurs|publisher=''[[BizAble]]''|last=Agundo|first=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest known game development in Kenya was around [[2007 in gaming|2007]], when independent game designer Wesley Kirinya worked alone on ''[[Adventures of Nyangi]]'', a "crude" action-adventure video game inspired by ''[[Tomb Raider]]''. Despite the game's low quality, it gained a large amount of press coverage for being among the first video games created on the African continent. Kirinya later joined with [[Ghanaian]] game developer Eyram Tawia to form the company Leti Games, which was rebranded as [[Leti Arts]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

In November 2007, NexGen was formed, a company by video game enthusiasts Nathan Masyuko and Ayub Makimei. Inspired in the mid-'90s by the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and works of [[Hideo Kojima]], Masyuko built a gaming center in 2009 from where the company hosts gaming tournaments. NexGen has been taking efforts to get [[esports]] off the ground in Kenya, with limited success.&lt;ref name="How we made it" /&gt; In 2010, [[Planet Rackus]] formed. The company released ''[[Ma3Racer]]'' on the [[Nokia Ovi Store]], expecting around 10,000 downloads over a year, but the game became popular by its primarily African audience was downloaded over 900,000 times within that time span.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

[[File:Meeting_at_iHub.JPG|250px|thumb|A meet-up at a Kenyan iHub.]]

Kirinya and Masyuko have worked together with artist Chief Nyamweya to develop ''[[Haki: Shield &amp; Defend]]'', an [[Android (OS)|Android]] game reaching 250,000 downloads and winning a [[World Youth Summit Award]], which Masyuko collected in [[Montreal]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; ''[[Pamoja Mtaani (video game)|Pamoji Mtaani]]'', developed by [[Warner Bros.]], won the Global Business Coalition’s Business Excellence Award in 2011 and globally recorded over a million sales after big names in the Kenyan music industry, such as [[Jua Cali]] and [[Kevin Wyre]], were involved in its production.&lt;ref name="BizAble" /&gt;

Though in 2007, there existed only a handful of retail stores predominantly selling video games, this number has gone up in recent years. In 2009, Kenya laid the first of its underseas [[fiber optic]] internet cables, bringing [[broadband internet]] within reach for the population. The government has since invested more money in the development of digital infrastructure, making online gaming viable. In 2010, [[iHub]] was created, a physical area for Kenyan ICT entrepreneurs to come together. Various other businesses followed suit, supporting start-up companies "through a mix of entrepreneurship training, research, funding, working spaces and mentoring." According to Masyuko, these developments are "shifting Kenya at a very unprecedented pace."&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

The first [[3D graphics|3D video game]] developed in Africa was released by [[Black Division Games]] in June 2015. The game, titled ''[[Nairobi X]]'', achieved a large amount of international coverage due to its high graphical quality and because it was released for PC as well as Android devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sde.co.ke/article/2000166847/defend-kenya-africa-s-first-3d-video-game-developed-in-kenya-now-available|title=Defend Kenya: Africa's first 3D video game developed in Kenya now available|publisher=''[[Standard Digital]]''|last=Mungai|first=Njambi|date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2015/08/17/nairobi-x-le-premier-jeu-video-africain-concu-au-kenya_4727624_3212.html|title=" Nairobi X ", le premier jeu-vidéo africain, conçu au Kenya|publisher=''[[Le Monde]]''|last=Meyerfield|first=Mat Bruno|date=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-06-30-kenya-develops-africas-first-3d-video-game|title=Is this Africa's first 3D video game?

In events, a young video game entertainment company called [[Gaming For Kenya]] otherwise known as G4k handled several major gaming events in the country as well as promoting the gaming culture. Their well known [[LAN parties]], known as the "1UP Elite" LAN party, have gained momentum and amplified the social gaming culture in Kenya uniting gamers together to play with each other and have fun.&lt;ref name="CIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.co.ke/news/top-stories/asus,-gaming-for-kenya-show-support-for-gamers-in-kenya|title=ASUS, Gaming for Kenya show support for gamers in Kenya|publisher=''[[CIO (website)|CIO]]''|last=Jefwa|first=Baraka|date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The Kenyan government plans to harness the technological progress of the country as part of its [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] plan, transforming the country into a "globally competitive and prosperous nation." This plan also involves the construction of a "[[Silicon Savannah]]," which is described as "Africa's answer to [[Silicon Valley]]." Despite these plans, [[unemployment]] is common in Kenya, and a failed ICT project could leave a young person without a job to fall back on.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; The rise of game development is creating jobs in the region.&lt;ref name="How we made it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/video-games-–-kenya’s-new-emerging-industry-with-‘huge-scope’/23366/2/|title=Video games – Kenya’s new emerging industry with 'huge scope'|publisher=''[[How We Made It In Africa]]''|last=Mulupi|first=Dinfin|date=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign [[AAA video game]]s sell for around US$100 in Kenya, making it impossible for the general public to purchase more than a handful of video games, though a rise in spending power has been noticed, with some young people buying high-end PCs valued US$17,000 and upward. An issue faced by ICT entrepreneurs is that gaming is not taken seriously by the general public, making it difficult to find financial support.&lt;ref name="How we made it" /&gt;

According to Masyuko, African game development is mainly focused on [[mobile gaming]], as this medium has the deepest penetration and the widest market. It is also considered an easier entry point as far as financing is concerned. However, Masyuko explains, "[w]e don't have proper retail stores like the [[iOS App Store|App Store]] ... if you want something you just go to this one-stop shop."&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; Developers at University of Games state that console gaming is picking up in the country, though it is not as prevalent as the mobile market.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-01-meet-kenyas-indie-gaming-pioneers|title=Meet Kenya's indie gaming pioneers|publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]''|last=Donian|first=Christian|date=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[internet café|cybercafes]] in [[Nairobi]] have a specific zone for people to play video games. These zones have proven to be more lucrative than charging for [[web browsing]].&lt;ref name="BizAble" /&gt; Kenya's video game industry was estimated to be worth US$44 million at the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="Atlanta" /&gt;

In [[eSports]], there are roughly established bodies governing eSports events with the likes of the high-quality event Pro Series Gaming(P.S.G)"&lt;ref name="PSG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psg.co.ke/about-us/|title=Pro Series Gaming (PSG)|publisher=''[[Pro Series Gaming]]|date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Tekken 254 Circuit"&lt;ref name="T254"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekken254.co.ke|title=Tekken 254 Circuit|publisher=''[[Tekken 254]]|date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Pan African Gaming Union(P.A.G.U) Championships&lt;ref name="PAGU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaming4kenya.com/pan-african-gaming-union|title=Pan African Gaming Union - PAGU Championship|publisher=''[[Pan African Gaming Union]]|date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Rise To Greatness - RIIG League"&lt;ref name="RIIG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smash.gg/tournament/rise-to-greatness-season-one/details|title=RIIG League|publisher=''[[Holos Gaming Matrix]]|date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other minor tournaments such as the Kenya International Gaming Series dubbed as "K.IN.G.S"&lt;ref name="KINGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaming4kenya.com/2016/08/k-in-g-s-esports-call-of-duty-championship|title=KINGS eSports Call Of Duty Championship|publisher=''[[Gaming For Kenya]]|date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vivid Gold ePlay Tournaments,&lt;ref name="VividGold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vividgold.co.ke/esports/#eluid14227483|title=Vivid Gold ePlay|publisher=''[[Vivid Gold]]|date=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, KAGE and many more. So far the Pro Series Gaming has been the most dominant eSports company in Kenya and over East and Central Africa hosting countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia and Malawi. Tekken 254 usually has a regular league called the Tekken 254 Circuit that runs every month until a full seasonal circuit is over as pro gamers await for the next season. The PAGU Championships, sponsored by Gaming For Kenya and other various entities is held throughout Africa with several countries that have membership to PAGU such as Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Zambia and other member countries. RIIG League is done occasionally is sponsored by the Holos Gaming Matrix(HGM) on the Xbox franchise.

A new culture has also been adopted whereby some gamers in Kenya have started their own [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch.tv]] channels. Regionally, they are the most known gaming [[YouTubers]], using this platform to connect with their audience and building a following.&lt;ref name="YouTubeGamers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfmJ655ceQ|title=Top 6 Kenyan Gamers|publisher=''[[Nerd Side]]|date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local philosophies==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Schild TMnr 2416-238.jpg|thumb|left|An East-African shield.]]
According to Brian Kinyua from four-man team [[University of Games]], games offer an environment in which players can tackle social problem by themselves, without a "mob to back you up [or] peers to cheer you on." Kinyua beliefs that the idea of solving societal issues with gaming should be taken more serious. University of Games released ''[[Election Thief]]'' in 2013 which promotes peace through a fictional story of attempted electoral fraud, inspired by the [[Kenyan general election, 2007|2007 Kenyan election]]. ''Haki: Shield and Defend'' as well as its sequel ''[[Haki: Chaguo Ni Lako]]'', similarly attempt to promote social messages such as saving trees from [[illegal logging]] and practicing peace and tolerance during Kenyan elections.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

Leti Arts commonly does contract development for [[serious games]], usually for companies that are interested in educating their employees or creating learning tools.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; [[Nairobi]]-based studio [[Momentum Core]] has specialized in developing games for educational purposes, such as games raising awareness for [[HIV]] and education games for children.&lt;ref name="Atlanta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2015/07/18/african-game-maker-allan-mukwana-hopes-make-games-international/|title=African Games Maker Allan Mukhwana Hopes to Take His Business International|publisher=''Atlanta Blackstar''|last=Nelson|first=Jasmine|date=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyan developers are mostly interested in making what they call "African games." According to Kirinya, what is important is that Kenyan games should tap into African cultural heritage, such as using traditional [[Military history of Africa|African weaponry]] rather than [[guns]] or medieval armor. There are also various thematic styles associated with Africa.
{{cquote|The colors, the ambiance, a lot of what people call earth colors — yellows, browns ... And then there's the sound part of it. There's a lot of percussion; the beat is a bit different. There's all these African sort of instruments. ... If it's an Age of Empires of Africa, you would not see an army with a full suit of armor — a full-cast armor.

'''''Voyeur''''' is an [[interactive movie]] [[video game]] released in 1993 for the [[Philips CD-i]]. [[MS-DOS]] and [[Macintosh]] computer ports were later released. A major selling point for the game was the "mature" content of the [[full motion video]] sequences, with a number of simulated sex scenes.

==Gameplay==
The player takes on the role of a private investigator hired by a member of the wealthy Hawke family in order to gain enough evidence to bring down the corrupt Reed Hawke (played by [[Robert Culp]]), CEO of Hawke Industries. Hawke has gathered his family together for the weekend to prepare for his announcement that he will be running for [[President of the United States]]. The player controls a video camera located in a building opposite to spy on the Hawke family home in an effort to gather enough evidence to destroy Reed Hawke's career. The player character's client is randomly selected each time a new game is started, and the storyline also changes according to the player's actions.

The game uses the surveillance concept pioneered by the [[Digital Pictures]] game ''[[Night Trap]]'', but without the "trap-em-up" elements. A sequel was released for PC and Macintosh entitled [[Voyeur II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/voyeur-ii|title=Voyeur II for DOS (1996) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a finished beta version of the sequel for Philips CD-I has been discovered and distributed on various abandonware sites.

==Reception==
Reviewing the Macintosh version, a ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic remarked derisively on the limited interactivity of [[full motion video based game]]s, but said that ''Voyeur'' is a superior game by the standards of its genre due to the solid acting. He gave it two out of five stars.&lt;ref name="NGen13"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Voyeur|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "Although it won't appeal to action fans, this title has enough depth and replay value to be a valuable addition to any CD-i library."&lt;ref name="NG1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3634">'''''Youxia''''' ({{zh|t=遊俠|s=游侠|p=Yóu Xiá}}, {{IPA-cmn|jǒʊɕjǎ|}}) was a type of ancient Chinese warrior [[folk hero]] celebrated in [[classical Chinese poetry]] and fictional literature.  It literally means "wandering [[vigilante]]", but is commonly translated as "[[knight-errant]]" or less commonly as "[[knight|cavalier]]", "adventurer", "soldier of fortune" or "underworld stalwart".&lt;ref&gt;Liu, James J. Y. ''The Chinese Knight Errant''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Of the two characters of the term, ''yóu'' (遊) literally means to "wander", "travel" or "move around", and ''xiá'' (俠) means someone with power who helps others in need.  The term refers to the way these men solely travelled the land using physical force or political influence to right the wrongs done to the common people by [[the powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]], often judged by their personal [[code of conduct|codes of chivalry]].  ''Youxia'' did not come from any social class in particular.  Various historical documents, [[wuxia]] novels and folktales describe them as being princes, government officials, poets, musicians, physicians, professional soldiers, merchants, monks and even humble farmers and butchers.  Some were just as handy with a calligraphy brush as others were with swords and spears.

According to Dr. James J.&amp;nbsp;Y.&amp;nbsp;Liu (1926–1986), a professor of [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] and [[comparative literature]] at [[Stanford University]], it was a person's temperament and need for freedom, and not their social status, that caused them to roam the land and help those in need. Dr. Liu believes this is because a very large majority of these knights came from northern China, which borders the territory of "northern nomadic tribes, whose way of life stressed freedom of movement and military virtues". Many knights seem to have come from [[Hebei]] and [[Henan]] provinces. A large majority of the characters from the ''[[Water Margin]]'', which is considered one of China's best examples of knight-errant literature, come from these provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shi Nai'an|Shi, Nai’an]] and [[Luo Guanzhong]]. ''[[Outlaws of the Marsh]]''. Trans. Sidney Shapiro. Beijing: Foreign Language Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|7-119-01662-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
One good example of Youxia poetry is ''The Swordsman'' （剑客） by [[Jia Dao]] ([[Tang Dynasty]]):

:''For ten years I have been polishing this sword;''
:''Its frosty edge''&lt;ref&gt;Extremely sharp.&lt;/ref&gt;'' has never been put to the test.''
:''Now I am holding it and showing it to you, sir:''
:''Is there anyone suffering from injustice?''&lt;ref name=liu&gt;Liu, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Liu, Jia’s poem "seems...to sum up the spirit of knight-errantry in four lines. At the same time, one can also take it as a reflection of the desire of all those who have prepared themselves for years to put their abilities to the test for some justice."&lt;ref name=liu/&gt;
