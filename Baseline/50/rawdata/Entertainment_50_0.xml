'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.''

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

The Acquine engine, developed at [[Penn State University]], rates natural photographs uploaded by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acquine.alipr.com |title=Aesthetic Quality Inference Engine - Instant Impersonal Assessment of Photos |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=21 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509101935/http://acquine.alipr.com/| archivedate= 9 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess{{explain|date=October 2018}} and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A relation between [[Max Bense]]'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov, S.; Musical Information Dynamics as Models of Auditory Anticipation; in Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, Ed. W. Weng, IGI Global publication, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Cheerleader''''' is the first and largest national teen magazine dedicated to covering sideline and competitive cheerleading. It was founded in 1995 and is currently based in Memphis, Tennessee. Staff includes Editor-in-Chief Jackie Martin and Managing Editor Kim Conley.

==History==
Inspired by the popularity and competitive nature of cheerleading in the early 1990s, publishing executive Michael Weiskopf started a magazine to take advantage of its evolving culture. The first issue was published in New York in January 1995.

It was published by Lifestyle Ventures, LLC, and the first issue featured [[University of Maryland]] cheerleader Penny Ramsey, who went on to become a castaway in Thailand on the CBS show ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Penny Ramsey - IMDb." The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Web. 20 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Special Collector’s Editions were produced in February 2005 and February 2010 to commemorate the magazine’s 10th and 15th anniversaries. Lifestyle Media, Inc. was acquired by [[Macfadden Performing Arts Media]], LLC in 2006. [[Varsity Spirit]] bought the magazine in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2012/american-cheerleader-sold-varsity-spirit-corp|title=American Cheerleader Sold to Varsity Spirit Corp.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2012/01/23/varsity-spirit-corp-buys-american.html Varsity Spirit Corp. buys American Cheerleader magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], archimimes were persons who imitated the manners, gestures, and speech both of the living and the deceased. At first, they were only employed in the [[theatre]], but were afterwards admitted to their feasts, and at last to [[funeral]]s. At funerals, archimimes walked behind the [[corpse]], imitating the gestures and behaviors of the person being carried to the [[funeral pyre]], as if they were still alive.

'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

In particular, bathos is associated with [[anticlimax (rhetoric)|anticlimax]], an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one. This may be either accidental (through artistic ineptitude) or intentional (for comic effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional bathos appears in [[satire|satirical]] genres such as [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] and [[mock epic]].

=== ''The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' ===
{{main|Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry}}
As the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by [[Alexander Pope]] in his essay ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'' (1727).  On the one hand, Pope's work is a [[parody]] in prose of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces."

The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathos'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. [[Edmund Burke]] was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756).

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this [[Hierarchy of genres|"low" genre]]:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Kurtz |last=Wimsatt |authorlink=William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr. |year=1989 |origyear=1954 |title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;pg=PA176 176] |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-0111-8 |oclc=19554431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink," the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum," or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope's day, the term "bathos," perhaps because of confusion with "[[pathos]]," has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so ''pathetic'' as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of [[Surreal humour]] and [[absurd humor|the absurd]].  However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for [[Robot Monster|a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet]] to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of [[kitsch]] (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of [[Titian|Titian's]] ''Last Supper'' on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the [[Camp (style)|camp sensibility]], as first analyzed by [[Susan Sontag]], in a 1964 essay [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html "Notes on camp"].

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one "Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
:"This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself."

Several decades before Pope coined the term, [[John Dryden]] had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his [[Restoration spectacular]], ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' (1684–85):
:"The cave of [[Proteus]] rises out of the sea, it consists of several arches of rock work, adorned with mother of pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the sea, and parts of [[Dover|Dover pier]]."

Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic ''[[Rape of the Lock]],'' where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover "or lapdog."  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''The Sickness Unto Death,'' did the same thing, when he suggested that the "self" is easy to lose and that the loss of "an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife" would be more grievous.  When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of ''undercutting.''  When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

[[Image:William Hogarth - The Bathos.png|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Bathos'']]

In 1764, [[William Hogarth]] published his last engraving, ''The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures'', depicting [[Father Time]] lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, [[parody]]ing the fashion at that time for "[[wikt:sublime|sublime]]" works of art, and [[satire|satirising]] criticisms made of Hogarth's own works.  It may also be seen as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later.  Headed ''Tail Piece'', it was intended as the [[tailpiece]] for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.

== Examples ==

===Traditional===
[[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[Enoch Arden]]'' ends with the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a [[pathos]]-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.

A musical representation is found in composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1923 [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.

=== Modern ===

Contemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:

The [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] features [[purple prose]], at times exhibiting bathos:

Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

Legendary [[darts]] commentator [[Sid Waddell]] was famed for his one-liners, including this example:
:“When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer..... [[Eric Bristow|Bristow]] is only 27.”

{{Expert needed|Sociology|ex2=Anthropology|talk=Limited cultural and temporal context|reason=the article discusses bedtime stories only in the context of contemporary Western culture|date=January 2018}}
A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".&lt;ref name=institution&gt;Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;Jones, Patti (2011). [http://www.parents.com/fun/entertainment/books/the-brainy-benefits-of-bedtime-stories/ "The Brainy Benefits of Bedtime Stories"]. ''Parents Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[unselfishness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt; Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

'''''Caliban by the Yellow Sands''''' is a play by [[Percy MacKaye]], published in 1916.

==Production information==
[[File:Houghton MS Thr 412 Caliban Harvard Stadium 1917.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''Caliban'' at Harvard Stadium June 28 to July 9 [1917].]]
MacKaye devised this piece in celebration for the 300th anniversary of [[Shakespeare]]'s death.

==St. Louis production (1914)==
MacKaye's first technical opportunity to experiment in devising a dramatic structure of Caliban's requirements was in [[St. Louis]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=Mackaye&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackaye|first=Percy|title=Caliban by the Yellow Sands|date=1916|publisher=Doubleday Page &amp; Co.|location=New York|pages=153|url=https://archive.org/details/calibanbyyellow02mackgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this initial production, there were seven thousand citizens who actually took part in the [[Masque]].&lt;ref name=Shattuck&gt;{{cite book|last=Shattuck|first=Charles Harlen|title=Shakespeare on the American Stage: From Booth and Barrett to Sothern and Marlowe|date=1987|publisher=Associated University Presses|location=London|isbn=9780918016775}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audience members would gather in public parks to witness the production, even if it mean they would have to pay! Over the five-day run, ''Caliban by the Yellow Sands'' was witnessed by half a million people (Kilmer 313). The following productions, although still influential and thriving, were much smaller in comparison.

==New York production (1916)==
After the St Louis production, MacKaye began to look to [[Central Park]] for an appropriate site to produce the community festival. The idea was to now have his Masque as the central popular piece in the festival, along with the hundreds of other Shakespearean celebrations. However, there were far too many people who opposed this idea of using Central Park and did not think that it was an appropriate setting for the production. This debate ended in the disapproval of the use of Central Park, which MacKaye was very disappointed about. He strongly believed that the ones who were against the idea were simply unaware of the impact and significance the initial production had on the citizens of St. Louis, and the potential affect it could have on the citizens of New York City.  He finally received approval to produce the play in New York two years later, at the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The New York production had an audience of 20,000 a night, with 2,000-3,000 people actually performing. Although still high in number, MacKaye desired more of what had been produced in St. Louis and longed to grow the piece in New York just as rapidly. The total audience of 135,000 covered the costs of around $100,000. However attempts to turn the enthusiasm for the production by having an annual event came to nothing with the US entry into the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Shattuck/&gt; The passion MacKaye had for expanding and growing the Masque rooted from his passion for mankind, which was the basis for the play as a whole as it resulted in the piece being titled a "Community Masque".

==Play information==
The play is loosely based on Shakespeare's play ''[[The Tempest]]'', and centers on the character [[Caliban]], the monster son of [[Sycorax]], and his desire for knowledge. The passage taken from ''The Tempest'', which is the inspiration for the masque, is when Prospero says, 
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;It was mine art
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out. (I.i.)&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The character of Caliban is meant to represent the "passionate child-curious part of us all": Caliban is depicted as a much more primitive character than [[Prospero]] or [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]], in his pursuit of the art of Prospero. These are not meant to be direct characters from Shakespeare's play but rather symbolic representations of what these characters mean in the context of his play. MacKaye was less worried about telling the journey of these characters in a story rather than present to the audience a piece of poetry meant to resonate with them on a deeper level. The play is constructed in a way which includes scenes concerning Caliban's story as well as anachronistic vignette-like scenes which take place in a separate performance area. A scene could occur between Caliban and Miranda and then immediately switch to a scene between Brutus and Lucius.

==Play's literature==
The language used by MacKaye is only one of many elements in the work meant to cultivate the idea he is trying to present. "If no word of the Masque be heard by the audience, the plot, action, and symbolism will still remain understandable". The symbolic structure to include pageantry, poetry, and dance in one play is MacKaye's attempt at forming a new genre of theatre meant to affect the masses of people who saw his performances. In his first production of ''Caliban by the Yellow Sands'' in St. Louis, his emphasis was on making all the elements of the theatre work synchronously. No single aspect of the Masque was meant to overpower another. The technical would work with the artistic and even the different artistic styles, which included elements of opera, song, dance, and various other performance styles, worked in one cohesive unit. While spectacle was a large part of the production, the poetry and literature were equally as important.
Mackaye worked with a number of activists from New York's various linguistic communities; the socialist labor leader and poet [[Arturo Giovannitti]] translated the play into [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name=Mackaye/&gt;

==MacKaye's ideals==
Caliban was meant to bring together a community not just civically but also intellectually. Mackaye's theoretiucal views could be seen in hisconcept of "Civic Theatre" which outlined before ''Caliban by the Yellow Sands'' was even a thought. MacKaye's Civic Theater was one which, "resembles the harmonious mind of a man whose splendid passions and imaginations are controlled and directed by his enlightened reason to the service of his race". His theatre was not that of the money hungry producer but that of the artist wanting to enlighten his fellow man. Caliban achieves this thought in the sense of the story MacKaye tries to tell. He presents the journey of mankind and its quest for art. It is a simple enough idea with many implications and interpretations making the audience a necessity. With an audience numbering in the hundreds of thousands, the conversations stirring around ''Caliban by the Yellow Sands'' would lead to debate, agreement, and mass intelligent thought accomplishing his goal of unifying a community.

==Critical commentary==
Thomas Cartelli has characterised MacKaye's depiction of the struggle between Prospero and Caliban as being reductively displayed as a manichean struggle between dark and light. He suggests that the scenes interposed from other works of Shakespeare are those least linked to social and political issues, rather focusing on unproblematic scenes from the romantic tragedies and festive comedies. The "Community Masque" places MacKaye in the position which he dramatises as that of Prospero/Shakespeare, who uses the theatre to uplift Caliban from the material world of [[Setebos (Shakespeare)|Setebos]]. Cartelli discusses the implications this has in the context of Jewish immigration to New York and suggests that Mackaye is asserting the values of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]ism in a way comparable to Senator [[Albert Beveridge]]'s concerns raised at the turn of the century. Cartelli thus considers MacKaye's work as an example of [[neocolonialism]], which asserts Shakespeare as providing the [[peak experience]] of western civilisation.&lt;ref name=Cartelli&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartelli|first=Thomas|title=Repositioning Shakespeare: National Formations, Postcolonial Appropriations|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=9781134647323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

'''''Celebrity Eye Candy''''' is a television series on [[VH1]] that first aired on December 15, 2005. It features photos and videos of celebrities taken by the [[paparazzi]] within the past week. Frequently the celebrities were shown in a poor light. The host of the show is never seen and is a voice-over only. He often opens the show with a somewhat humorous song about the video that was presented over the course of the show. In addition, the host normally sings a few songs about celebrities doing something normal things, such as scratching an itch or grocery shopping.

The show initially aired weekly episodes for approximately 4 months but with mediocre [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. It was put on hiatus in July 2006. It returned in February 2007, albeit on a more sporadic airing basis.

'''Central Park of Culture and Leisure named after Shcherbakov''' is a [[park|recreation park]] in [[Donetsk]]. It is located in [[Voroshylovskyi Raion]], in the west it matches with [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]], and in the north there is the Second city [[pond]].

Park was open in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldonetsk.info/en/central-recreation-park-shcherbakova-donetsk|title=The central recreation park of A.S. ShCherbakova in Donetsk - Donetsk: Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[rides]], [[playgrounds]], alleys for hiking and other recreational facilities available for visitors.
The park is named after [[Alexander Shcherbakov|Alexander Sergeevich Shcherbakov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrainehotelsonline.com/en/travel-Parks-Donetsk-Shcherbakova-Park/Shcherbakova-Park-Donetsk.html|title=Shcherbakova Park in Donetsk, photo and description Shcherbakova Park attraction of Donetsk, excursions to Shcherbakova Park, entertainment in Donetsk, Shcherbakova Park - the main attraction of Donetsk|first=Ukraine Hotels|last=Online|website=www.ukrainehotelsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the Secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee in 1938. However, the original name was different – at first the park was named after [[Pavel Postyshev|Pavel Petrovich Postyshev]], but the park was renamed after the last had been arrested.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/139|title=Парк им. Щербакова в Донецке - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the park==
The park is located in Skoromoshnaya [[gully]], which was the meeting place for workers of [[Yuzovsky metallurgical plant]] and the nearby [[coal mines]] in the 19th century. A [[travelling circus]] stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a  park, and in September 1932  10 000 [[Komsomol]] members and the city [[pioneer movement|pioneers]] started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.
In 1933 the alleys were established lined with [[chestnut tree]]s, [[lime tree]]s and [[Populus|poplar]]s. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. [[Amusement rides]] started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park "Medium Ponds", landscape park "Urban forest" and the "Upper" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the [[parterre]], which is the basis of the composition. The [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]] is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which [[pavilions]] were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of [[columns]] with [[cornices]]; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of [[tree]] and [[Shrub|shrub species]], and the 1955 edition "Donbass Parks" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk [[journalists]] established "Alley of Journalists". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, "Donetskproekt" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and [[rosary]] with variety of roses was made.

==Sculptures==
The sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of [[Joseph Stalin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/167|title=Парк культуры имени отдыха (товарища Щербакова) - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands.  In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball.  Stadium "Shakhtar" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/stalino/142|title=Архитектура довоенного Сталино - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a [[jar]] was placed on the banking of the "First" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the "Good Angel of Peace" was established in the Park as international symbol of [[patronage]]. On the statue basis the names of famous [[krainians|Ukrainian]] [[Patrón|patrons]] are carved: [[Nickolay Tereshchenko]], [[Bogdan Khanenko]], [[Vasiliy Tarnovskiy]], [[Rinat Akhmetov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html Остров&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131552/http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/ukraina/2008/09/01/519234.html|title=В Донецке русские художники золотом написали имя Ахметова|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/daily/130808/51296/ В парке им.

==Fountains==
The fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a [[parapet]]. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331030957/http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Children's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The [[train]] consisted of two coupled together [[trams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzd-ussr.ru/towns/donezk/|title=Донецк. Детская железная дорога|website=www.dzd-ussr.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the [[World War II]] outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; "Green" summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a [[Performance surface|dance floor]], a [[restaurant]], [[parachute]] tower (existed until 1970), reading, [[chess]] and [[checkers]] pavilions. Currently 23 kinds of amusement rides are working in the park,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citylife.donetsk.ua/ten_places/show/sherbakova_park Donetsk City Guide - hotels, sights, restaurants, history, culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009150318/http://citylife.donetsk.ua/ten_places/show/sherbakova_park |date=October 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the boat station offers [[boats]] and [[catamarans]] to hire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10582">The '''classical unities''', '''Aristotelian unities''', or '''three unities''' are rules for [[drama]] derived from a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In their [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] form they are as follows:

#''unity of action'': a play should have one action that it follows, with minimal subplots.
#''unity of time'': the action in a play should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours.
#''unity of place'': a play should exist in a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.

==Aristotle's unities==
Aristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of "definition of tragedy", where he wrote: "serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude". 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe08.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VII].&lt;/ref&gt; … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe09.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VIII].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[tragedy|tragic]] forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Poetics'', V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of [[Greek drama]], and many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.

Aristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his ''Poetics'' during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another "unity".

==European literature==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[Italy|Italian]] critics of the 16th century, from [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] onwards, and then [[French literature of the 17th century|17th-century French]] critics, proponents of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays.  French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], was highly regular, and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in ''[[Le Cid]]''. The [[England|English]] dramatists writing for the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean stage]] were largely unaware of these structures.

By the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the [[English Interregnum]]) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, [[John Dryden]], among many others, compares the "irregular" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'') with the "regular" [[Dryden]] in his ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespeare's history plays]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Dryden declared Shakespeare "incomparable" because of his disregard for convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Pope]] criticizes the violation of the unities in his ''[[Dunciad]]''.  In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that "Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land" (''Dunciad'' 1728, i, 69&amp;ndash;70).  Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.

[[Samuel Johnson]], too, applied the unities to drama in his ''Prefaces to Shakespeare''. He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Preface to his Edition of Shakespeare's Plays (1765),'' ff. a7r&amp;ndash;a7v, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Pitcher]], in his [[Arden Shakespeare]] Third Series edition of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of ''Poetics'' that became popular around 1608, and that &lt;i&gt;The Winter's Tale&lt;/i&gt; is intentionally breaking all the rules.

The classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of [[classicism]]. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias'' of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] Spanish theatre. Lope's ''Arte nuevo'' is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.

A '''clip show''' is an episode of a [[Television program|television series]] that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a [[frame story]] in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Clip shows are also known as '''cheaters''', particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before [[series finale]]s, or once [[100 episodes|syndication becomes highly likely]]. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).

==Origin==
Clip shows have their origin in theatrical [[short film]]s and [[Serial (film)|serials]]. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these '''recap chapters''' (also called "economy chapters"),
previous chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the [[Republic Pictures]] serial ''[[Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island]]''. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and [[stock footage]] from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.

Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of [[The Three Stooges]] which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for "new" films than for old ones.

Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as "cheaters" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include ''[[Betty Boop's Rise to Fame]]'' ([[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1934), ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Schlesinger]]/[[Warner Bros.]]) and a regular yearly series of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]'' "cheaters" such as ''[[Smitten Kitten]]'' (1952, [[MGM cartoon studio|MGM]]).

==Variations==
One variant of the modern clip show is the '''compilation episode''', using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.

Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'' featured actor [[Henry Fonda]] discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on ''[[Three's Company]]'', hosted by [[Lucille Ball]]. This format was parodied in a clip show for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"), in which fictional actor [[Troy McClure]]&amp;mdash;a recurring ''Simpsons'' character&amp;mdash;introduced the clips.

A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' aired after the death of cast member [[Jack Soo]], with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character [[Detective Sergeant]] Nick Yamana.

''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=98, Clerks: The Animated Series |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-04-18 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' episode "The Ember Island Players", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. "The Ember Island Players" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.

The [[NBC]] sitcom [[Community (TV series)|''Community'']] used the clip show format with the episode "[[Paradigms of Human Memory]]", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of ''Community'', [[Dan Harmon]], used the same format in another one of his shows, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.

In [[anime]], a common type of episode is the '''Recap episode''', which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.

==Rationale==
While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or "corny" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent "remembering").{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Daytime [[soap operas]] frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of ''AtWT''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th anniversary.

Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' season 3 episode "The Straight Poop" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the "weekly" series had been broadcast. ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' resorted to producing ''five'' clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.

Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' had one more episode to shoot. However, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for [[principal photography]]. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG 365"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Paula M.|last2=Erdmann|first2=Terry J.|last3=Moore|first3=Ronald D.|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation 365|date=2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613124000|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbTA9wMmEAC&amp;pg=PT330|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", in which the "clips" were the induced dreams of a comatose [[William T. Riker]]. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nemecek|first1=Larry|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780743476577|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1k_EsaOHsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in [[self-parody]], explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using "clips" from episodes which never happened.  The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned ''Moonlighting'' clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the [[fourth wall]] to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a "new episode next week!".

The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'']]. Many [[anime]] dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'' running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).

Sometimes clip shows air before or during a [[series finale]] as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''/''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Cheers]]''.

Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'' was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' for airing in syndication. Surviving content from [[Bozo the Clown]] and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into ''[[Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics]]'', an annual holiday special.

'''Coin Shooting Pistols''' are devices designed to fire common currency of various [[Denomination (currency)|denominations]].

One of the earliest known in the [[United States]] is for a [[patent]] filed Nov. 11, 1909 &lt;ref&gt;US. Patent #966,288 filed Nov.11, 1909, patented Aug 2,1910 Theodore Zens&lt;/ref&gt; by Theodore Zens. No known examples exist today.
Two patents exist for [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] shooting [[pistol]]s designed for shooting coins at [[Toll road|toll booth baskets]] from 1965 and 1988.

The first commercial production of a coin shooting pistol was by MacGlashan Air Machine Gun Company. MacGlashan was better known for the [[Air gun|air powered machine guns]] that fired [[.177 caliber|Steel BB's]] used by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corp]], and the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] as an [[Air gunner|aerial gunnery trainer]].

In 1945 MacGlashan introduced the "New Coin Shooting Pistol"&lt;ref&gt;Aug 4,1945 - Billboard Magazine. Pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; designed for the [[amusement park]] and [[carnival]] business. MacGlashan designed their pistol to shoot an [[Nickel (United States coin)|American Nickel]] providing [[Box office|booth operators]] income from the coins used to try and win prizes. Original expectations were for the booth operator to set prizes on shelves that would have to be knocked off the shelf to win. Coins would be trapped by a cloth behind the prizes and operators would simply collect their days earnings from under the prizes.

In 1946 MacGlashan began offering colorful [[Shooting sport|targets]] designed to have five [[Ace|"aces"]] that would have to be knocked down to win from a selection of prizes.

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17294">'''Comic book therapy''' is a form of [[art therapy]] in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific [[comic book]]s, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books.&lt;ref name="Comicspedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicspedia.net/|title=Comicspedia: the intersection of comic books and clinical psychology|last=O'Connor|first=Patrick|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in an effort to reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life.

Both forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.

== Comic Book Therapy and Graphic Medicine ==
{{main|Graphic medicine}}

Graphic medicine, originally coined by [http://myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams], is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It owes its success in part to the rise of [[medical humanities]], an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as "graphic pathologies", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.

Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.

The general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.

== History ==
The foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/history-of-comics/|title=The History of Comics: Decade by decade {{!}} The Artifice|website=the-artifice.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of ''The Funnies #1'' that the first collection of comics material came about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]], [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]], [[Peanuts]],'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]].''

Professionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicmedicine.org/a-short-history-of-art-comics/|title=A Short History of "Art" Comics {{!}} Graphic Medicine|last=Williams|first=Ian|date=|work=Graphic Medicine|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics #1'']], the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=M|date=2017|title=Graphic Novels: A Brief History, Their Use in Business Education, and the Potential for Negotiation Pedagogy|url=|journal=Negotiation and Conflict Management Research|volume=10|pages=324–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Current Uses in Today's Medical Setting ==
Since its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=M.J|date=1971|title=The use of graphic images in psychotherapy|url=|journal=American Journal of Art Therapy|volume=10|pages=153–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=E|date=1997|title=The symbolic graphic life-line: Integrating the past and present through graphic imagery|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=14|pages=261–267|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=A.J.|date=2017|title=Using comics to communicate about health: An introduction to the symposium on visual narratives and graphic medicine|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=32|pages=523–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jawad|first=Muna|date=2015-12-01|title=Comics are Research: Graphic Narratives as a New Way of Seeing Clinical Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=369–374|doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.

=== Therapeutic Tool ===

==== Creating a comic book ====
One form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=M.J.|date=2004|title=Comics as Art Therapy|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=21|pages=42–43|doi=10.1080/07421656.2004.10129317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"/&gt; Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, M.J. &amp; Myers, K.R.|first=|date=|title=Graphic medicine: use of comics in medical education and patient care.|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|pages=574–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reading a comic book ====
Another form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[eating disorder]]s, and so on. Popular novels include ''Cancervixen: a True Story'' by [[Marisa Acocella Marchetto]], ''Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me'' by [[Sarah Leavitt]], and ''Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me'' by [[Ellen Forney]]. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described  within the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karno|first=M.|last2=Brunon|first2=J|last3=Arch|first3=M|last4=Waldron|first4=P|date=1977|title=Therapeutic use of generative graphics|url=|journal=Art Psychotherapy|volume=4|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.

=== Educational Tool ===
Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmond|first=S.W.|last2=Echevarria|first2=M|date=|title=Healthcare Transformation and Changing Roles for Nursing|journal=Orthopedic Nursing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=12–25|doi=10.1097/NOR.0000000000000308|issn=0744-6020|pmc=5266427|pmid=28107295}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu/medical-education/md-program|title=M.D. Program {{!}} Medical Education|website=medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael J.|last2=Myers|first2=Kimberly|last3=Watson|first3=Katie|last4=Czerwiec|first4=M. K.|last5=Shapiro|first5=Dan|last6=Draus|first6=Stephanie|date=2016-12-01|title=Creativity in Medical Education: The Value of Having Medical Students Make Stuff|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=475–483|doi=10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''''Digimon''''' ({{lang|ja|デジモン}} ''Dejimon'', branded as '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters''''', stylized as '''''DIGIMON'''''), short for "Digital Monsters" ({{lang|ja|デジタルモンスター}} ''Dejitaru Monsutā''), is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing [[digital pet|virtual pet]] toys, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[video game]]s, [[film]]s and a [[trading card game]]. The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a "[[Virtual world|Digital World]]", a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various communication networks.

The franchise was first created in 1997 as a [[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|series of virtual pets]], akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary [[Tamagotchi]] or nano [[Giga Pet]] toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American [[comics]]. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', and an early video game, ''[[Digimon World]]'', both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and [[List of Digimon video games|the video game series]] has expanded into genres such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[racing game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]]. Other media forms have also been released.

==Eponymous creatures==
Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs|デジタマ|Dejitama}}. In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a {{nihongo|Digimental|デジメンタル|Dejimentaru}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called "Digivolution" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as ''Ultra'' in the dub.

===Television series===

The ''Digimon'' [[anime]] series was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made, which later became the basis for ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''. Several more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies. The series was dubbed for release in Western markets, with the first four series under the title ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.

===Distribution and localization===

In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcast through [[Fox Kids]]. The first four series were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters Episode Guide|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010615125822/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|archivedate=2001-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's [[standards and practices]]. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw ''Digi-Bowl'' specials co-produced with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]; ''NFL on Fox'' commentator [[Terry Bradshaw]] provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters: Digibowl 2002|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020123021428/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|archivedate=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during ''[[Digimon Tamers|Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 3)]]'', the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]] due to a deal between Disney and UPN.&lt;ref name="erickson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003, Volume 1|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|authorlink1=Hal Erickson (author)|year=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=|isbn=978-0786420995 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UPN]] aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney.&lt;ref name="erickson"/&gt; ''Frontier'' aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and [[Toon Disney]] (for the latter under the [[Jetix]] branding) for several years after. ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor [[Disney XD]]. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Xros Wars]]''. [[Funimation Entertainment]] has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''.

In September 2012, [[Saban Brands]] announced it had re-acquired the ''Digimon'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Deborah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Brand|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/sep/25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Franchise|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-franchise|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=AnimeNewsNetwork|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Brand|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=BSCKids|date=September 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234026/http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Saban acquired ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' for broadcast on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States starting September 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |title=Nickelodeon dives into Digimon &amp;#124; News |publisher=C21Media |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416084142/http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |archivedate=2013-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three episodes, the show was moved to [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] starting October 13, 2013.

''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and its two sequels, ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', were added to the [[Netflix]] Instant Streaming service in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles. [[Crunchyroll]] began streaming the English-subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, followed by the second season on March 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-02/crunchyroll-to-stream-digimon-xros-wars-anime|title=Crunchyroll to Stream Digimon Xros Wars Anime|work=Anime News Network|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'', and ''Tamers'' were briefly removed from Netflix.

In Canada, the English versions were broadcast on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], but only the first 26 episodes of ''Digimon Fusion'' were shown. The dubbed version of ''Data Squad'' aired on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]]. In the United Kingdom, ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s children's slot [[CITV]] from 2001-2002, which broadcast ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' and a small amount of ''Tamers'' airing during after school hours. The entirety of ''Tamers'' aired on cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] from 2002–04. ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' was originally announced on Jetix but was later dropped. The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://mailchi.mp/30f437a59d09/aw-slate&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2011, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on [[Kix!]] (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids's (2000–03) and Kix's (2010-) [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] Television ratings, ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' &amp; ''Tamers'' have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing Data Top 10s|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10?|publisher=BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board)|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by [[ITV Studios#ITV Studios Global Entertainment|ITV Studios Global Entertainment]], Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, [[CITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Michelle|title=ITV to broadcast Digimon Fusion anime in 2014|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2013101730346/itv-to-broadcast-digimon-fusion-anime-in-2014.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Jeremy|title=ITV licenses Digimon Fusion|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/10/18/itv-licenses-digimon-fusion/|publisher=Kidsscreen|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manga==
Digimon first appeared in [[narrative]] form in the [[One shot (comic)|one-shot]] manga ''[[C'mon Digimon]]'', released in the summer of 1997. ''C'mon Digimon'' spawned the popular ''[[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]]'' manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.

===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===
A Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (余 遠鍠 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers ''Digimon Adventure'' in five volumes, ''Digimon Adventure 02'' in two, ''Digimon Tamers'' in four, and ''Digimon Frontier'' in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote ''[[D-Cyber]]''.

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by [[Chuang Yi]] in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by [[Lianne Sentar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liannesentar.com/works/ |title=Lianne Sentar's Other Published Works/Works List |publisher=Liannesentar.com |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[TOKYOPOP]] in [[North America]].&lt;br&gt;The three volumes for ''Digimon Frontier'' have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of ''Digimon Frontier'' were distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia.

===Dark Horse===
{{main|Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] published American-style Digimon [[comic book]]s, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of ''Digimon Adventure'' in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horn | first = Daniel |author2=Ryan Hill | others = illustrated by Daniel Horn, Cara L.

===Panini===
The Italian publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.

In February 2010, a website for the online multiplayer game, ''[[Digimon Battle Online]]'', was launched, showing it to be based primarily in the world of the Tamers saga and its characters.&lt;ref name="wemade1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digimonbattle.wemade.net/main/main.asp |title=Digimon Battle- The Journey Begins.

==Card game==
The Digimon Collectible Card Game is a card game based on Digimon, first introduced in Japan in 1997 and published by Bandai. The third season (''[[Digimon Tamers]]'') utilized this aspect of the franchise by making the card game an integral part of the season. Versions of the card game are also included in some of the Digimon video games including ''Digital Card Battle'' and ''[[Digimon World 3]]''.

'''''Dirty John''''' is an investigative journalism [[podcast]] hosted by journalist Christopher Goffard and created by ''[[Wondery]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. The first two chapters were launched on October 2, 2017, with the following four chapters being released over the following days. The podcast was downloaded over 10 million times within 6 weeks of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

==Title==
The title "Dirty John" came from one of John Meehan's nicknames given to him by his classmates during his time at the [[University of Dayton]]. Other nicknames from this time included Filthy John or just Filthy. The exact nexus of these nicknames was never divulged during the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-filthy/#nt=outfit46 |title= Dirty John Part 3: Filthy - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Dirty John'' is a [[true crime]] story focusing on the life and exploits of John Meehan. ''[[L.A. Times]]'' journalist Christopher Goffard first heard of Meehan when he learned that the police were investigating a possible murder in [[Newport Beach]]. Upon investigating, Goffard discovered a bizarre web of deceit and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/dirty-john-inside-hit-la-times-true-crime-podcast-w509773 |title= 'Dirty John': Inside Hit 'L.A. Times' Podcast  |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the story is Meehan's relationship with businesswoman Debra Newell, whom he met via an [[Online dating service|Internet dating]] site, as well as her immediate and extended family. The podcast deals with themes of abuse and manipulation, as well as the behaviours of those being abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/dirty-john-your-chilling-new-true-obsession-podcasts-of-the-week |title=  Dirty John, your chilling new true crime obsession – podcasts of the week |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English|newspaper=  The Guardian |date=  2017-10-13 |last1=  Verdier |first1=  Hannah |last2=  Slaney |first2=  Rowan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meehan himself was killed by Newell's youngest daughter Terra, who acted in self-defense when he tried to kill her on the rooftop parking lot of her apartment building on August 20, 2016. He was hospitalized and died on the 24th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-stabbing-20160825-story.html|title=Man dies after being stabbed by woman he assaulted with knife, police say|first=Hannah|last=Fry|date=|website=latimes.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was covered by ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on January 12, 2018, and included interviews with Goffard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/11/dateline-nbc-dirty-john-episode-clip/|title=See Terra Newell describe her showdown with 'Dirty John' Meehan in exclusive 'Dateline NBC' clip|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/coercive-control-potential-factor-dirty-john-case-psychological-abuse-n837361|title=‘Coercive control’ potential factor in ‘Dirty John’ case of psychological abuse|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/KNTV_20180113_060000_Dateline_NBC|title=Dateline NBC : KNTV : January 12, 2018 10:00pm-11:01pm PST|author=|date=13 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dayton.com/news/local/former-dayton-woman-talk-about-marriage-dirty-john-dateline/tvPMd3uVFi47hFe2oNa1JL/|title=Former Dayton woman to talk about marriage to ‘Dirty John’ on Dateline|author=|date=|website=dayton.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3t6vI8Xwo|title=Dirty John - Christopher Goffard speaks about his story - Dirty John Podcast|first=|last=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|date=21 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqPWWoFyalOCIwjROCK8yg|title=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dramatic monologue''', also known as a [[persona]] poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. [[M.H. Abrams]] notes the following three features of the ''dramatic monologue'' as it applies to poetry:
{{Quotation|
# A single person, who is patently ''not'' the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment […].
# This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker.
# The main principle controlling the poet's choice and formulation of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that enhances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. ed. "Dramatic Monologue." ''A Glossary of Literary Terms.'' 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of dramatic  monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue  is [[romantic poetry]]. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]'', to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting.  The [[conversation poems]] of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], beginning in the latter's case with her long poem ''The Improvisatrice''.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Baiesi. ''Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Metrical Romance'', 2009, p.56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in [[Albert Camus]] ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.

== Examples ==

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After ''Ulysses'', Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are ''Tithonus'', ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' and ''St. Simon Stylites,'' all from the 1842 ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.
*[[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Dover Beach]]'' and ''Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse'' are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing [[scepticism (philosophy)|scepticism]] of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867's ''New Poems.''
*[[Robert Browning]] produced his most famous work in this form. While ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Caliban upon Setebos]]'', ''[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]'' and ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', as well as the other poems in ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' are just a handful of Browning's monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote several, including ''Jenny'' and ''The Blessed Damozel''; [[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a number, including ''The Convent Threshold.'' [[Augusta Webster]]'s ''A Castaway,'' ''Circe'', and ''The Happiest Girl In The World'', [[Amy Levy]]'s ''Xantippe'' and ''A Minor Poet,'' and [[Felicia Hemans]]'s ''Arabella Stuart'' and ''Properzia Rossi'' are all exemplars of this technique. [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'' has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Raven]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]'s [[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]].

Post-Victorian examples include [[William Butler Yeats]]'s ''The Gift of Harun al-Rashid'', [[Elizabeth Bishop]]'s ''Crusoe in England'', and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' and ''[[Gerontion]]''.

Sims]], 1903, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Electrophone''' was a distributed audio system, which operated in the [[United Kingdom]], primarily in London between 1895 and 1925. Using conventional telephone lines, it relayed live [[theatre]] and [[music hall]] shows plus Sunday church services, to subscribers who listened over special headsets. It was ultimately unsuccessful in competing with the development of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.

==History==

The Electrophone was preceded by the similarly organized [[Théâtrophone]] system of [[Paris, France]], which began operation in 1890. In 1894, Mr. H. S. J. Booth formed the Electrophone Company, Ltd. with an initial capitalization of £20,000,&lt;ref&gt;"The Pleasure Telephone" by [[Asa Briggs]], from ''The Social Impact of the Telephone'', Ithiel de Sola, Editor, 1997, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and the service began operations in London the next year, with Booth acting as the Managing Director. Initially the company operated under a licence issued by the [[National Telephone Company]].
[[File:1917 London Electrophone hospital listeners.jpg|thumb|325px|right|Hospitalized British soldiers, joined by their toy elephant mascot (centre), enjoying the Electrophone service in The London Hospital (now The [[Royal London Hospital]]), probably Colton Ward, in late 1914&lt;ref name="wounded"&gt;"British Wounded Hear London's Favorites Via Telephone", ''[[The Electrical Experimenter]]'', August 1917, page 230.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
To pick up the programmes, multiple large carbon microphones were placed in the theatre footlights to pick up the sounds of the performers. In churches, the microphones were disguised to look similar to bibles. Home subscribers were issued headphones connected to their standard telephone lines. The annual charge was £5, which limited its affordability to the well-to-do. [[Queen Victoria]] was included as one of the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080387452;view=1up;seq=166 "The Queen and the Electrophone"], ''[[The Electrician]]'', 26 May 1899, page 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, it was noted that coin operated receivers had been installed in some hotels, which provided a few minutes of entertainment for a [[Sixpence_(British_coin)|sixpence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080386348;view=1up;seq=355 "The Electrophone"] by J. Wright, ''The Electrical Engineer'', 10 September 1897, page 344.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional lines were installed, for free, for use by convalescing hospital patients.&lt;ref name="wounded" /&gt;

A special manual switchboard, located at the Electrophone building in Pelican House on [[Gerrard Street, London]], provided links to the participating entertainment establishments and churches. Subscribers called Electrophone operators to have their lines connected to the site they selected. Subscribers with two telephone lines could use the second line to make a request to change the site during the course of an evening. A 1906 advertisement stated that they could choose from among fourteen theatres — the [[Aldwych Theatre|Aldwych]], [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra]], [[Apollo Theatre|Apollo]], [[Daly's Theatre|Daly's]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]], [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]], [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric]], [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace]], [[London Pavilion|Pavilion]], [[Prince of Wales's Theatre|Prince of Wales's]], [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury]] and [[Tivoli Theatre of Varieties|Tivoli]] — in addition to concerts from the [[Queen's Hall|Queen's]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]]s, and, on Sundays, services from fifteen churches. 
&lt;ref name="cable"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_n1vr0_RbXoC&amp;pg=PA794&amp;lpg=PA794&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KwMu3TFuVh&amp;sig=k021sfvDPF26PQY-1v3mtHC1fh4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKlpfoi4fNAhVCMFIKHaqjCHQQ6AEISzAM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Cable Radio — Victorian Style"] by Denys Parsons, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 30 December 1982, page 794.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, telephone operations were transferred to the control of the [[General Post Office]]. The Electrophone paid to the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] an annual fee of £25 plus a royalty of [[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] per subscriber. In 1920, the service received £11,868 from subscribers, with operating expenses of £5866, including a £496 royalty payment to the Post Office. Theatres were paid 10 [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s annually for each connected subscriber.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1982), pages 795-796.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fairly long-lived, the Electrophone never advanced beyond a limited audience. In 1896 there were just 50 subscribers, although this increased to over 1000 by 1919, and just over 2000 at its peak in 1923. However, competition due to the introduction of radio broadcasting resulted in a rapid decline, falling to 1000 by November 1924. In early 1923 an Electrophone director was quoted as saying that "it would be a long time before broadcasting by wireless of entertainments and church services attained the degree of perfection now achieved by the electrophone."&lt;ref&gt;"Entertainment by Wireless: The Future of the Electrophone", ''[[The Times]]'', 10 January 1923, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that proved to be overly optimistic, and as of June 30, 1925, the London Electrophone ceased operations.&lt;ref&gt;"Electrophone, Ltd.", ''The Times'', 17 June 1925, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Note the use of the word "wireless" to refer to radio transmission, as opposed to the "hard wired" transmission of the Electrophone.

A second, much smaller system, was established in Bournemouth in 1903, but the maximum number of subscribers only reached 62 as of 1924. This system was finally discontinued in 1938, after it was determined during the previous year that there were only two remaining subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1982), page 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">{{about|the policy of screening people based on their appearance|the album from the indie rock duo Handsome Furs|Face Control}}

'''Face control''' refers to the policy of upscale [[nightclub]]s, casinos, restaurants and similar establishments to strictly restrict entry based on a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]'s snap judgment of the suitability of a person's looks, money, style or attitude, especially in [[Russia]] and other former Soviet countries such as [[Ukraine]]. The term "face control" comes from the fact that establishments are attempting to use exclusivity to preserve their public "face".

Although a similar "velvet rope" policy exists in other countries, aiming to admit the right mix of "beautiful people" and keep out boring or unattractive would-be patrons, the Russian version is considered particularly harsh and unforgiving by Western standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/style/tmagazine/27moscoww.html?pagewanted=all
|newspaper=New York Times |author=Joshua Yaffa |date=September 25, 2009 |title=Barbarians at the Gate |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare occasional use of this term in English can be considered a linguistic [[reborrowing]] via the Russian [[pseudo-anglicism]] фейсконтроль (''feiskontrol'').

==Admission standards==
Goscilo notes that, as the more upscale establishments are "temples of unbridled self-presentation-masquerading-as-pleasure," wealth is not enough to guarantee admission; a wealthy person who lacks the proper respect, culture, sartorial elegance, prettiness, or impressively expensive model car may nonetheless be denied admission. Face control, since it requires discernment, is considered an art, with Moscow only having about ten truly excellent face controllers. 

Some establishments only practice face control on Fridays and Saturdays, so customers unable to meet the bouncer's standards can come at other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goscilo, Helena|title=Celebrity and Glamour in Contemporary Russia|publisher=Routledge|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moscow, stricter face control tends to be implemented as the evening progresses, so people can also avoid it by coming early for dinner, before the bouncers are posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Let's Go Eastern Europe 13th Edition|author=Gustafson, Ingrid|date=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As foreigners are sometimes preferred, speaking English has also been noted as helpful in getting through face control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Eastern Europe|author=Averbuck, Alexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Richmond advises, "Arrive in a small group, preferably with more men than women" and to smile to "Show the bouncer that you are going to enhance the atmosphere inside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Russia|author=Richmond, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''film producer''' is a person who oversees the production of a film.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Producers Guild of America|website=www.producersguild.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either employed by a [[production company]] or working [[Independent film|independently]], producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script; coordinating writing, directing, and editing; and arranging financing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/ma-filmmaking/areas-study/producing|title=Producing |publisher= London Film School|website= lfs.org.uk |language =en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "discovery stage," the producer finds and selects promising material for development.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Then, unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer has to hire a [[screenwriter]] and oversee the [[Filmmaking#Development|development of the script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/27-2012.01|title=27-2012.01 - Producers|website=www.onetonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a script is completed, the producer will lead a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] to secure the financial backing (a "[[Green-light|green light]]") to allow production to begin.

The producer also supervises the pre-production, production, and post-production stages of filmmaking. One of the most important tasks is to hire the [[Film director|director]] and other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-producer#|title=TV or film producer|website=nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the final say on creative decisions. Finally, the producer will oversee the marketing and [[Film distribution|distribution]].

For various reasons, producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the main producer may hire and delegate work to [[executive producer]]s, [[line producer]]s, or [[unit production manager]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt22"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/three-studios-agree-to-plan-to-certify-who-deserves-to-be-a-producer/|title=Three Studios Agree to Let a Guild Certify Credits for Film Producers|last=Cieply|first=Michael|date=8 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
===Development (film rights)===
During this stage of the production process, producers bring together people like the [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[production designer]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles/757_producer|title=Producer|website=creativeskillset.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate [[screenwriter]].&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/news/1648610/007_writers_to_tackle_quotbarbarellaquot/|title=writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have been hired to pen the screenplay for producer Dino de Laurentiis|accessdate=13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmakers.com/artists/williamgoldman/biography/page2.htm|title=Goldman was contacted by director/producer Rob Reiner to write the screenplay|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an existing script is considered flawed, they are able to order a new version or make the decision to hire a [[script doctor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynch.de/dunetimeout.html|title=He began work on the script.

More time and money spent in pre-production can reduce the time and money wasted during production time.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

===Pre-production===
During production, the producer's job is to make sure the film stays on schedule and under budget.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; They will always be in contact with directors and other key creative team members.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name = bergan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/30/bernd-eichinger-obituary|title=Bernd Eichinger [obituary]|quote =In 1979, Eichinger bought a large stake in the Munich-based production and distribution company Constantin Film, which he ran as a hands-on producer for over 30 years|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = europacorp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-movie-business-luc-besson-s-growing-empire-a-612371.html|title=Europacorp studio posted $186 million in revenues last year, making it second only to Germany's Constantin Film as Europe's largest independent studio|accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, cast and [[film crew]] often work at different times or places, and certain films even require a [[second unit]]. The executive producer of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' original trilogy was [[George Lucas]] himself, the creator of the ''Star Wars'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/bio/georgelucas.html|title=Lucas continued the Star Wars saga as story writer and executive producer with The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983.|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405085412/http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/bio/georgelucas.html|archivedate=5 April 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
For various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production. For example, some producers run a company which also deals with film distribution.&lt;ref name = bergan/&gt;&lt;ref name = europacorp/&gt; Also, cast and [[film crew]] often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a [[second unit]].

===Post-production===
During post-production, the producer has the last word on whether sounds, music, or scenes have to be changed or cut. Even if the shooting has been finished, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative [[test screening]], producers may even demand and get an alternative film ending. This happened, for example, with ''[[First Blood]].'' The test audience reacted very negatively when Rambo died, so the producers re-shot a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmorrell.net/rambo-pages/david-morrell-on-rambo/|title=test audiences nearly rioted after cheering for Rambo and then seeing him die. So the producers went back to Hope, British Columbia, the location for the film, and shot a new ending in which Rambo lives|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, producers work with marketing and distribution companies in order to sell the film or arrange its distribution rights.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

==The union==
Within the industry, all of the producers union contracts are negotiated by [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)]]. It was founded in 1924 by the U.S Trade Association as the Association of Motion Picture Producers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://collections.oscars.org/link/bio/1473|title = Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) records|website =Special Collections: Margaret Herrick Library |publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally created to only negotiate labor contracts, but during the mid-1930s they took over all contract negotiation responsibilities that were once controlled by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This alliance negotiates with a wide range of other associations when dealing with producers union contracts. These associations include, the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA), the [[Directors Guild of America]]  (DGA), and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amptp.org/|title=AMPTP|website=amptp.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They negotiate over eighty industry wide union agreements and on behalf of 350 producers within the industry. It has been responsible for negotiating all of these union contracts within the industry since 1982. Today, it is considered the industry's official contract negotiation representative for everyone within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmmakeriq.com/2012/09/a-guide-to-hollywood-unions/ "A Guide to Hollywood Unions | FilmmakerIQ.com"]. ''filmmakeriq.com''. Retrieved 2017-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career process==
There are many different ways to become a film producer. [[Stanley Kramer]] started as an [[Film editing|editor]] and [[writer]], while other producers started as actors or directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection|title=Mr. Kramer began his career in the 1930s as an editor and writer, later forming an independent production company|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most producers start in a college, university or film school. On the occasion of announcing his own film school, 'École de la Cité, film producer [[Luc Besson]] admitted that at the beginning of his career, he would have appreciated the chance to attend a film school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoledelacite.com/en/|title=École de la cité|website=Ecole de la cité}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/luc-besson-launches-film-school-1118055818/|title=Luc Besson launches film school|work=Variety|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film school]]s and many [[University|universities]] offer [[Academic degree|degree courses]] that include film production knowledge, with some courses that are especially designed for future film producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|title=The MFA Advanced Film Practice programme aims to equip you with the creative, professional and technical knowledge you will need to enter the professional arena as a writer, producer or director.|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416155055/http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionecsc.it/context.jsp?ID_LINK=18&amp;area=7|title=The training course last three years and the interdisciplinary teaching programme prepares students in the specific areas of directing, scriptwriting, acting, photography, editing, sound techniques, production, set design, props and wardrobe|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses focus on key topics like [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]], [[script development]], script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting.&lt;ref name="Filmakademie2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filmakademie.de/en/studium/course-of-study/production/production/|title=Course of Study - Production |accessdate= |website = Filmakademie Baden Wurttemberg GmbH|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|title=Our BA in Film Production is one of our most highly sought-after courses.|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202000449/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|archivedate=2 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dffb.de/html/en/studium/produktion|title=Producing seminars teach through practical studies in production, script development, budgeting, and media economics|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can also expect practical training regarding post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bfm.ee/programmes/film-arts/film-arts-ma/|title=All student films are developed, shot and post-produced in teams, closely mirroring a realistic industry work process in order to ease graduates' transitions to the professional environment|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training at a top producing school is one of the most efficient ways a student can show professionals they are not a rookie.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/becoming-a-producer-tried-and-tested-career-paths/|title=Becoming a Producer - Tried and Tested Career Paths|date=2015-06-12|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-US|newspaper=Student Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While education is one way to begin a career as a film producer, experience is also required to land a job. [[Internship]]s are a great way to gain experience while in school and give students a solid foundation on which to build their career. Many internships are paid, which enable students to earn money while gaining hands-on skills from industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-get-a-production-internship-1283507|title=Where to Look for Internship Programs in Entertainment|access-date=2017-02-03|newspaper=The Balance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/ways_into_the_industry|title=Ways into the film industry - Film Industry - Creative Skillset|website=creativeskillset.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through internships, students get to network with people in the film industry as well. This pays off in the end when looking for jobs after school. Once an internship is over, the next step typically will be to land a junior position, such as a [[production assistant]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Although rates can vary based on a producer's role and the location of filming, the average salary can start anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000, even doubling when working in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/jobs-film-average-salary-career-paths/|title=Jobs in Film: Average Salary &amp; Career Paths|date=2014-12-01|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-US|newspaper=Student Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is $109,844. When examining more than 15,000 producers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640.&lt;ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/highest-paying-jobs-film-industry.htm#page=1|title=10 Highest Paying Jobs in the Film Industry|date=30 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers can also have an agreement to take a percentage of a movie's sales.&lt;ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2" /&gt;

There is no average work day for a film producer, since their tasks are changing from day to day. A producer's work hours are often irregular and can consist of very long days with the possibility of working nights and weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/television-film-video-producer|title=Television/film/video producer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

In the United States, the average video game player is 30 years old and has been playing video games for over 12 years.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp |title=The Entertainment Software Association - Industry Facts |publisher=Theesa.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128000000/http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp |archivedate=2014-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games.&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://askaboutgames.com/?c=/pages/factsFigures.jsp |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Askaboutgames |accessdate=2010-07-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613033013/http://www.askaboutgames.com/?c=%2Fpages%2FfactsFigures.jsp |archivedate=13 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pew Research Center]], 49% percent of adults have played a video game at some point in their life.

A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gaymer, or gay gamer, is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as [[LGBT]] ([[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[lesbian]], or [[transgender]]) and have an active interest in video games. &lt;ref name=joystiq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/08/gaymer-org-looks-to-trademark-gaymer/|title=Gaymer.org looks to trademark 'Gaymer'|author=Alexander Sliwinski|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2011-06-05|work=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one in 2006,&lt;ref name="first ever survey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618040019/http://www.washingtonblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=7415 |archivedate=2006-06-18 |title=First-ever survey of gay videogamers |accessdate= |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |authorlink= |date=2006-06-10 |work= |publisher=[[Washington Blade]] |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&amp;article_code=2071|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101100249/http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&amp;article_code=2071|archivedate=2009-01-01|title=Gay video game player survey |accessdate= |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |authorlink= |date=2006-06-08 |work= |publisher=In Newsweekly |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5377127/what-do-gay-gamers-want-from-their-games |title=What Do Gay Gamers Want From Their Games? |accessdate= |last=Fahey |first= Mike  |authorlink= |date=2009-10-08 |work= |publisher=Kotaku.com |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watermarkonline.com/w-news/orlando/item/403-orlando-student-conducts-gay-gamer-survey |title=Orlando student conducts gay gamer survey |accessdate= |last=Hyman |first=Jamie |authorlink= |date=2009-09-03 |work= |publisher=Orlando Watermark |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101122135/http://www.watermarkonline.com/w-news/orlando/item/403-orlando-student-conducts-gay-gamer-survey |archivedate=November 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moonfalk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Warren Moon]] and [[Marshall Faulk]] playing a video game]]
It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Casual gamer'': The term ''casual gamer'' is often used for gamers who primarily play [[casual games]], but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/30/core-and-casual-whats-the-difference/|title=Core and Casual: What’s the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"/&gt; The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console.&lt;ref&gt;Magrino, Tom, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result;title;1 GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B1 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyes, Emma, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 GDC '08: Are casual games the future?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000000/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, ''GameSpot'', Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of casual games include ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6695921|title=Women driving 'casual game' boom|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fitness gamer"s, who play motion-based exercise games, are also seen as casual gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://playstationlifestyle.net/2010/04/19/plethora-of-fitness-titles-lined-up-for-playstation-move/|title=Plethora of Fitness Titles Lined Up For PlayStation Move#|work=PlayStation LifeStyle|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Core gamer'': A core or mid-core gamer is a player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games,&lt;ref name="IwataAsksWiiU3definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote='''Iwata''':  the definition of a core gamer is much wider, namely, someone who has a much wider range of interests, someone who enthusiastically plays many types of games that challenges different creative directions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer.

[...] The keyword for our presentation at this year's E3 is "Deeper and Wider". With Wii U, I would like to offer this proposal with that concept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games.  James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas [[Jon Radoff]] of [[Disruptor Beam]] compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hardcore gamer'': [[Ernest W.

Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/260885,the-problems-of-defining-a-hardcore-gamer.aspx|title=The problems of defining a hardcore gamer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/10/22/call-of-duty-demonstrates-the-completely-fictitious-line-between-hardcore-and-casual-gaming/|title='Call of Duty' Demonstrates The Completely Fictitious Line Between Hardcore And Casual Gaming|first=Paul|last=Tassi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional gamer===
{{See also|eSports}}
[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]]. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in [[competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly [[South Korea]] and [[China]], professional gamers and teams are [[sponsorship|sponsored]] by large companies and can earn more than {{USD|link=yes}}100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/7/23/235053/081 |title=A Brief Look At Professional Gaming |publisher=kuro5hin.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Major League Gaming]] contracted several ''[[Halo 2]]'' players including [[Tom "Tsquared" Taylor]] and members of [[Team Final Boss]] with $250,000 USD yearly deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/mlg-awards-1-75-million-in-contracts-for-top-pro-gamers |title=MLG Awards $1.75 Million in Contracts for Top Pro Gamers (press release)|work=Major League Gaming |date=December 18, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Geisha'''''|芸者}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}; {{IPA-ja|ɡeːɕa|lang}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forvo.com/word/geisha/ |title=How to pronounce 'Geisha' |website=[[Forvo]] |access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ezglot.com/words.php?l=eng&amp;w=geisha |title=English 'geisha' translations |website=EZ Glot |access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|''geiko''|芸子}}, or {{nihongo|''geigi''|芸妓}} are Japanese women who entertain through performing the ancient traditions of art, dance and singing, and are distinctively characterized by traditional costumes and makeup. 

Contrary to popular belief, Geisha are not the Eastern equivalent of a prostitute; a misconception originating in the West due to interactions with [[Oiran]] Japanese courtesans, whose traditional attire is similar to that of geisha. 

==Terms==
[[File:Geisha-kyoto-2004-11-21.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[nape]] [[make-up]] on a ''maiko'' (Note the red collar)]]
[[File:Konpira fune fune.jpg|thumb|''Maiko'' Tomitsuyu playing the game "Konpira Fune Fune" with a female patron]]
The word ''geisha'' consists of two [[kanji]], {{nihongo2|芸}} (''Gei'') meaning "[[art]]" and {{nihongo2|者}} (''Sha'') meaning "person" or "doer". The most literal translation of geisha into English would be "artist", "performing artist", or "artisan". Another name for geisha is ''Geiko'' ({{nihongo2|芸妓}}), which translates specifically as "Woman of Art". This term is used to refer to geisha from Western Japan, which includes Kyoto and Kanazawa.

Apprentice geisha are called ''[[Maiko]]'' ({{nihongo2|舞妓}}), literally "Woman of Dance", or ''Hangyoku'' (半玉), "Half-Jewel" (meaning that they were paid half of the wage of a full geisha),&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Masuda |first=Sayo |date=2003 |title=Autobiography of a Geisha |translator-last=Rowley |translator-first=G. G. |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-12951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the more generic term ''o-shaku'' ({{nihongo2|御酌}}), literally "one who pours (alcohol)". The white make-up and elaborate [[kimono]] and hair of a maiko is the popular image held of geisha. A woman entering the geisha community does not have to begin as a maiko, having the opportunity to begin her career as a full geisha. Either way, however, usually a year's training is involved before debuting either as a maiko or as a geisha. A woman above 21 is considered too old to be a maiko and becomes a full geisha upon her initiation into the geisha community.

On average, Tokyo apprentices (who typically begin at 18) are slightly older than their Kyoto counterparts (who usually start at 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=218 |chapter=The Real Memoirs of Geisha |date=May 2006 |isbn=978-1-58648-394-4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJy_g4eYX2cC&amp;pg=200 |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |first=Sheridan |last=Prasso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, geisha often began the earliest stages of their training at a very young age, sometimes as early as 6 years old. The early ''Shikomi'' (in-training) and ''Minarai'' (learns by watching) stages of geisha training lasted for years (shikomi) and months (minarai) respectively, which is significantly longer than in contemporary times. A girl is often a shikomi for up to a year while the modern minarai period is simply one month.

It is still said that geisha inhabit a separate world which they call the ''Karyūkai'' or "The Flower and Willow World". Before [[Oiran#History|they disappeared]], the [[Oiran|courtesans]] were the colourful "flowers" and the geisha the "[[Willow#Culture|willows]]" because of their subtlety, strength, and grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=5–6 |publisher=Gotham |date=February 2004 |origyear=2003 |isbn=978-1-59240-050-8 |title=Madame [[Sada Yacco|Sadayakko]] The Geisha Who Bewitched the West |last=Downer |first=L. |chapter=In Search of Sadayakko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the early stages of Japanese history, there were female entertainers: ''Saburuko'' (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families were displaced from struggles in the late 600s. Some of these ''saburuko'' girls sold sexual services, while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings. After the imperial court moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyoto) in [[Heian period#History|794]] the conditions that would form geisha culture began to emerge, as it became the home of a [[Heian period#Beauty|beauty-obsessed elite]].&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art |location=London |publisher=PRC |date=2003 |isbn=1-85648-697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled female performers, such as [[Shirabyōshi]] dancers, thrived.

Traditional Japan embraced sexual delights (it is not a [[Shinto]] taboo) and men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/16/the-rise-of-the-geisha-photos-from-19th-20th-century-show-the-japanese-entertainers/ |title=The Rise of the Geisha - photos from 19th &amp; 20th century show the Japanese entertainers |first=Neil |last=Patrick |date=16 May 2016 |website=The Vintage News |access-date=6 November 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal wife was a modest mother and manager of the home; by [[Confucian view of marriage|Confucian custom]] love had secondary importance. For sexual enjoyment and romantic attachment, men did not go to their wives, but to [[courtesan]]s. Walled-in pleasure quarters known as {{Nihongo||遊廓、遊郭|[[yūkaku]]}} were built in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of geisha |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/culture/geisha.shtml |website=Japan Zone |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1617 the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] designated "pleasure quarters", outside of which prostitution would be illegal,&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; and within which ''yūjo'' ("play women") would be [[Prostitution in Japan#Shogunate era|classified and licensed]]. The highest ''yūjo'' class was the geisha's predecessor, called ''[[tayuu]]'', a combination of [[actress]] and prostitute, originally playing on stages set in the dry [[Kamo River|Kamo]] riverbed in Kyoto. They performed erotic dances and skits, and this new art was dubbed ''kabuku'', meaning "to be wild and outrageous". The dances were called "kabuki", and this was the [[Kabuki#1603.E2.80.931629: Female kabuki|beginning of kabuki theater]].&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

===18th-century emergence of the geisha===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Beauty - Gion Seitoku.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe depicting a Gion geisha, from between 1800 and 1833]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - A Kyoto Geisha - Yamaguchi Soken.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe print by Yamaguchi Soken of a Kyoto geisha]]
These pleasure quarters quickly became glamorous entertainment centers, offering more than sex. The highly accomplished courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing, and playing music. Some were renowned poets and [[calligraphy|calligraphers]]. Gradually, they all became specialized and the new profession, purely of entertainment, arose. It was near the turn of the eighteenth century that the first entertainers of the pleasure quarters, called ''geisha'', appeared. The first geishas were men, entertaining customers waiting to see the most popular and gifted courtesans (''[[oiran]]'').&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

The forerunners of the female geisha were the teenage ''odoriko'' ("dancing girls"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Geisha Girl |url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofgeishagir00fujiuoft#page/18/mode/2up |first=Taizo |last=Fujimoto |page=18 |isbn=978-1-4086-9684-2 |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; expensively trained as chaste [[dance]]rs-for-hire. In the 1680s, they were popular paid entertainers in the private homes of upper-class samurai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoshiwara: the glittering world of the Japanese courtesan |first=C. S. |last=Seigle |date=March 1993 |origyear=1931 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4T-kJB8vKvcC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=171 |chapter=Rise of the Geisha |isbn=978-0-8248-1488-5 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many had turned to prostitution by the early 18th century. Those who were no longer teenagers (and could no longer style themselves ''odoriko''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Osaka Prints: Glossary |first=J. |last=Fiorillo |url=http://www.osakaprints.com/content/information/glossary.htm |quote=''geiko'': "Arts child", originally dancing girls who were too young to be called geisha but too old (more than twenty years of age) to be called odoriko. Geiko was the pronunciation used in the Kamigata region. Some geiko operated as illegal prostitutes. By the nineteenth century the term became synonymous with geisha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adopted other names—one being ''"geisha"'', after the male entertainers. The first woman known to have called herself ''geisha'' was a [[Fukagawa (Tokyo)|Fukagawa]] prostitute, in about 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law |last=Tiefenbrun |first=S. |title=Copyright Infringement, Sex Trafficking, and the Fictional Life of a Geisha |volume=10 |year=2003 |ssrn=460747 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.460747 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a skilled singer and [[shamisen]] player named Kikuya who was an immediate success, making female geisha extremely popular in 1750s Fukagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha: a unique world of tradition, elegance, and art |first=J. |last=Gallagher |date=October 2003 |publisher=PRC Publishing |isbn=978-1-85648-697-2 |page=252 |chapter=Appendix II a timeline of geisha and related history}}—Gallagher says that "Kiku" from Fukugawa district founded the profession in 1750, and that by 1753 one hundred ''odoriko'' were consigned to [[Yoshiwara]], which licensed (female) Geisha in 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; As they became more widespread throughout the 1760s and 1770s, many began working only as entertainers (rather than prostitutes), often in the same establishments as male geisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/shopcore/978-0-8248-1488-5/ |title=Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan |first=Cecilia Segawa |last=Seigle |date=1931 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |pages=172-174 |access-date=22 September 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613115352/http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/shopcore/978-0-8248-1488-5/ |archive-date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the geisha===
[[File:Tokyo Geisha with Shamisen c1870s,.jpg|thumb|Tokyo ''geisha'' with ''[[shamisen]]'', circa 1870s]]
The geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were essentially imprisoned and strictly forbidden to sell sex in order to protect the business of the [[oiran]]. While licensed courtesans existed to meet men's sexual needs, ''machi geisha'' carved out a separate niche as artists and erudite female companions.

By 1800, being a geisha was considered a female occupation (though there are still a handful of male geisha working today). Eventually, the gaudy Oiran began to fall out of fashion, becoming less popular than the chic ("[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)#Interpretation|iki]]") and modern geisha.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; By the 1830s, the evolving geisha style was emulated by fashionable women throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/geisha.html |page=74 |chapter=The paradox of modernity |first1=L. C. |last1=Dalby |oclc=260152400}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many different classifications and ranks of geisha. Some women would have sex with their male customers, whereas others would entertain strictly with their art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=347 |title=Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms: The Militarization of Aesthetics in Japanese History |first=E. |last=Ohnuki-Tierney |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-226-62091-6 |quote=[Before 1796] ''kuruwa geisha'' referred to the geisha in the geisha quarters who entertained their clients with the skills and performing arts and also offered their bodies. The term ''yūjo'' and'' jorō'' were used to distinguish them from ''machi geisha'', who were exclusively entertainers ... some of the latter too engaged in sexual services}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in Japan]] was legal up until 1908, so it was practiced throughout Japan.

[[World War II]] brought a huge decline in the geisha arts because most women had to go to factories or elsewhere to contribute to post war reconstruction. The geisha name also lost some status during this time because prostitutes began referring to themselves as "geisha girls" to American military men.&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalby |first=Liza |year=1998 |title=Geisha |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the geisha world, including the teahouses, bars and geisha houses, was forced to close, and all employees were put to work in factories. About a year later, they were allowed to reopen. The few women who returned to the geisha areas decided to reject Western influence and revert to traditional ways of entertainment and life. "The image of the geisha was formed during Japan's feudal past, and this is now the image they must keep in order to remain geisha."&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; It was up to these returning geisha to bring back traditional standards in the profession, though with increased rights for the geisha:
{{quote |text=After Japan lost the war, geisha dispersed and the profession was in shambles. When they regrouped during the Occupation and began to flourish in the 1960s during Japan's postwar economic boom, the geisha world changed. In modern Japan, girls are not sold into indentured service. Nowadays, a geisha's sex life is her private affair. |sign=[[Liza Dalby]] |source=Do They or Don't They?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/ng_geisha_sex.html |title=Do They or Don't They |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Dalby |first=Liza |website=lizadalby.com |quote=The question always comes up...just how 'available' is a geisha? ...

There were many rumors that stated before the war, a maiko's virginity would be auctioned (the original "[[mizuage]]").&lt;ref name="Melissa Hope Ditmore 2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work |first=Melissa Hope |last=Ditmore |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-313-32969-9 |location=Westport, Conn |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBvqXL0jTQC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=erikae+maiko+geiko#PPA184,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-674-01753-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan encyclopedia |publisher=Belknap Pr of Harvard U |location= |year=2005 |page=234 |isbn=0-674-01753-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=mizuage&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this was confused with the girls who were apprentices to prostitutes and courtesans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Wayne |last2=Gallagher |first2=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art |publisher=PRC Publishing |location= |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPDkdaPE3aUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22John+Gallagher.%22+geisha#PPA135,M1 |page=135 |isbn=1-85648-697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory education laws passed in the 1960s made traditional geisha apprenticeships difficult, leading to a decline in women entering the field.&lt;ref name="bowing out"&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubman |first=Howard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/12/archives/geisha-tradition-is-bowing-out-in-japan-geishas-fighting-losing.html |title=Geisha Tradition Is Bowing Out in Japan; Geishas Fighting Losing Battle Against New Trends in Japan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 12, 1968 |page=49 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Geisha, a Life'', [[Mineko Iwasaki]] said: "I lived in the karyukai during the 1960s and 1970s, a time when Japan was undergoing the radical transformation from a post-feudal to a modern society. But I existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past."&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"/&gt;

==Ranking==
At the pinnacle of the complex geisha ranking system are the [[dowager#Noun|grand dowagers]] of Kyoto.

As reported by Dalby (1983) from her impressions in 1975&lt;ref&gt;''Geisha'' 2008 pp. 18, 77, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiko from the other two ''hanamachi'' (Gion Higashi and [[Miyagawa Cho]]) have high prestige but are considered to be one rank lower.

==Stages of training==
[[File:Geisha, maiko, shikomi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Geiko Fumikazu with her minarai imōto Momokazu, and a shikomi from the Odamoto okiya]]
Traditionally, Geisha began their training at a young age. Some girls were bonded to geisha houses (''[[okiya]]'') as children. Daughters of geisha were often brought up as geisha themselves, usually as the successor (atotori, meaning "heir" or "heiress" in this particular situation) or daughter-role (musume-bun) to the okiya.

A maiko is an apprentice and is therefore bonded under a contract to her okiya. The okiya supplies her with food, board, kimono, [[Obi (sash)|obi]], and other tools of her trade. Her training is very expensive and her debt must be repaid to the okiya with the earnings she makes. This repayment may continue after the maiko becomes a full-fledged geisha and only when her debts are settled is she permitted to move out to live and work independently.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

A maiko will start her formal training on the job as a ''minarai'', which literally means "learning by watching" at an ozashiki (お座敷, a banquet in any [[Minka|traditional Japanese building]] with [[tatami]]), to sit and observe as the other maiko and geiko interact with customers. This is a way in which she will gain insights of the job, and seek out potential clients. Although minarai attend ''ozashiki'', they do not participate at an advanced level. Their [[kimono]], more elaborate than a geiko's, are intended to do the talking for them. Minarai can be hired for parties but are usually uninvited (yet welcomed) guests at parties that their ''onee-san'' attends. They only charge a third of the usual fee. Minarai generally work with a particular tea house (''Minarai-jaya'') learning from the ''okaa-san'' (literally "mother", the proprietress of the house). From her, they would learn techniques such as conversation and gaming, which would not be taught to them in school. This stage lasts only about a month or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha: A Life |last1=Iwasaki |first1=Mineko |authorlink1=Mineko Iwasaki |last2=Brown Ouchi |first2=Rande |authorlink2=Rande Gail Brown |page=132 |publisher=Atria |edition=first |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-7434-4432-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Performing Gion Kouta.jpg|thumb|Maiko Katsumi and Mameteru performing the Gion Kouta.]]
After a short period the final stage of training begins, and the students are now called "maiko", rather than minarai. Maiko (literally "dance girl") are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for up to 5 years. Maiko learn from their senior maiko and geiko mentors. The ''onee-san'' and ''imouto-san'' (senior/junior, literally "older sister/younger sister") relationship is important. The ''onee-san'', any maiko or geiko who is senior to a girl, teaches her maiko everything about working in the [[hanamachi]]. The onee-san will teach her proper ways of serving tea, playing [[shamisen]], dancing, casual conversation and more.

[[File:Geisha-obi.jpg|thumb|left|Senior ''maiko'' Suzuha wearing ''[[sakkō]]'', two weeks before her ''[[erikae]]''.]]
There are three major elements of a maiko's training. The first is the formal arts training. This takes place in special geisha schools which are found in every ''hanamachi''. The second element is the entertainment training which the maiko learns at various tea houses and parties by observing her ''onee-san''. The third is the social skill of navigating the complex social web of the ''hanamachi''. This is done on the streets. Formal greetings, gifts, and visits are key parts of any social structure in Japan and for a maiko, they are crucial for her to build the support network she needs to survive as a geisha.

Maiko are considered one of the great sights of Japanese tourism, and look very different from fully qualified geisha. They are at the peak of traditional Japanese femininity. The scarlet-fringed collar of a maiko's kimono hangs very loosely in the back to accentuate the nape of the neck, which is considered a primary erotic area in Japanese sexuality. She wears the same white makeup for her face on her nape, leaving two or sometimes three stripes of bare skin exposed. Her kimono is bright and colourful with an elaborately tied ''obi'' hanging down to her ankles. She takes very small steps and wears traditional wooden shoes called ''[[okobo]]'' which stand nearly ten centimeters high.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt; There are five different [[hairstyle]]s that a maiko wears, that mark the different stages of her apprenticeship. The "[[Nihongami]]" hairstyle with [[Hairstyling tool#Kanzashi|"kanzashi"]] hair-ornamentation strips is most closely associated with maiko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nihongami no sekai |first=I. |last=Tetsuo |trans-title=The World of traditional hairstyles and hair ornaments |publisher=Nihongami Shiryōkan |isbn=4-9902186-1-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on holed-pillows to preserve the elaborate styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/geisha4.htm |title=Dressing as a Geisha |first=J. |last=Layton |website=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiko can develop a [[#Hair|bald spot on their crown]] caused by rubbing from Kanzashi strips and tugging in hairdressing.

Around the age of 20–21, the maiko is promoted to a full-fledged geisha in a ceremony called ''[[erikae]]'' (turning of the collar).&lt;ref name="Melissa Hope Ditmore 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Wayne |last2=Gallagher |first2=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art |publisher=PRC Publishing |location= |year=2003 |page=159 |isbn=1-85648-697-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPDkdaPE3aUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22John+Gallagher.%22+geisha&amp;client=safari#PPA159,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could happen after three to five years of her life as a ''maiko'' or ''hangyoku'', depending on at what age she debuted. Geisha remain as such until they retire.

==Female dominance in geisha society==
{{quote |text=The biggest industry in Japan is not shipbuilding, producing cultured pearls, or manufacturing transistor radios or cameras. It is entertainment.|sign=Boye De Mente |source=''Some Prefer Geisha''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boye |year=1966 |title=Some Prefer Geisha |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Company |location=Rutland, VT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term geisha literally translates to "entertainer". Some prostitutes refer to themselves as "geisha", but they are not. A geisha's sex and love life is usually distinct from her professional life. A successful geisha can entertain her male customers with music, dance, and conversation.

{{quote |text=Geishas are not submissive and subservient, but in fact they are some of the most financially and emotionally successful and strongest women in Japan, and traditionally have been so.|sign=Iwasaki Mineko|source=''Geisha, A Life''&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Mineko |first1=Iwasaki |first2=Rande |last2=Brown |year=2003 |title=Geisha, A Life |publisher=Washington Square |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Geisha learn the traditional skills of dance and instruments and hold high [[social status]]. Geisha are single women, though they may have lovers or boyfriends whom they have personally picked, who support them financially.

{{quote |text=There is currently no western equivalent for a geisha—they are truly the most impeccable form of Japanese art. |sign=Kenneth Champeon |source=''The Floating World''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/2130 |title=The Floating World|accessdate=12 January 2010|last=Champeon|first=Kenneth|date=3 November 2002|format=|work=|publisher=Things Asian|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Relationships with male guests===
The appeal of a high-ranking geisha to her typical male guest has historically been very different from that of his wife. The ideal geisha showed her skill, while the ideal wife was modest. The ideal geisha seemed carefree, the ideal wife somber and responsible. Historically, geisha did sometimes marry their clients, but marriage necessitated retirement, as there were never married geisha.

Geisha may gracefully flirt with their guests, but they will always remain in control of the hospitality. Over their years of apprenticeship they learn to adapt to different situations and personalities, mastering the art of the hostess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://aminoapps.com/page/anime/5627502/what-is-a-geisha |title=What Is A Geisha? |website=Amino Apps |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geisha as a women-centered society===
Women in the geisha society are some of the most successful businesswomen in Japan. In the geisha society, women run everything. Without the impeccable business skills of the female tea house owners, the world of geisha would cease to exist. The tea house owners are entrepreneurs, whose service to the geisha is highly necessary for the society to run smoothly. Infrequently, men take contingent positions such as hair stylists,&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt; dressers (dressing a maiko requires considerable strength) and accountants,&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; but men have a limited role in geisha society.

{{quote |text=The geisha system was founded, actually, to promote the independence and economic self-sufficiency of women. And that was its stated purpose, and it actually accomplished that quite admirably in Japanese society, where there were very few routes for women to achieve that sort of independence. |sign=[[Mineko Iwasaki]] in interview |source=''[[Boston Phoenix]]''&lt;ref name="Wieder"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tamara |last=Wieder |title=Remaking a memoir |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106181143/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |archivedate=6 January 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The majority of women were wives who did not work outside of their familial duties. Becoming a geisha was a way for women to support themselves without becoming a wife. Thus, some argue {{who?|date=June 2018}}  that geisha women live in a women-centered society.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Women run the geisha houses, they are teachers, they run the tea houses, they recruit aspiring geisha, and they keep track of a geisha's finances.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The only major role men play in geisha society is that of guest, though women sometimes take that role as well.&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt;

Historically, [[Feminism in Japan|Japanese feminists]] have seen geisha as exploited women, but some modern geisha see themselves as liberated feminists:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1656 |title=Japanese Feminism |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Collins |first=Sarah |date=24 December 2007 |website=Serendip Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We find our own way, without doing family responsibilities. Isn't that what feminists are?"&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt;

==Modern geisha==
Modern geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called ''okiya'' in areas called ''[[hanamachi]]'' ({{nihongo2|花街}} "flower streets"), particularly during their apprenticeship. Many experienced geisha are successful enough to choose to live independently. The elegant, high-culture world that geisha are a part of is called ''karyūkai'' ({{nihongo2|花柳界}} "the flower and willow world").

Before the twentieth century, geisha training began when a girl was around the age of six. Now, girls must go to school until they are 15 years old and have graduated from middle school and then make the personal decision to train to become a geisha. Young women who wish to become geisha now most often begin their training after high school or even college. Many more women begin their careers in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=now more [university] students are interested in becoming geisha |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisha still study traditional instruments: the ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[shakuhachi]]'', and drums, as well as learn games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=29 |title=Japan the Culture |first=B. |last=Kalman |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7787-9298-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traditional songs, [[Japanese calligraphy#Today|calligraphy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=2 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype, page 2|date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese traditional dances (in the [[nihonbuyō]] style), [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], literature, and [[japanese poetry|poetry]].&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_performing_arts.html |title=Japan Performing Arts |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_dance.html |title=Japan Dance |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

By watching other geisha, and with the assistance of the owner of the geisha house, apprentices also become skilled dealing with clients and in the complex traditions surrounding selecting and wearing [[kimono]], a floor length silk robe embroidered with intricate designs which is held together by a sash at the waist which is called an obi.&lt;ref name="tames-1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tames |first=Richard |title=A Traveller's History of Japan |date=September 1993 |publisher=Interlink Books |location=[[Brooklyn, New York]]|isbn=1-56656-138-8 |page= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kalman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalman |first=Bobbie |title=Japan the Culture |date=March 1989 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=[[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]] |isbn=0-86505-206-9 |pages= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Japan, geisha and their apprentices are now a rare sight outside ''hanamachi'' or {{nihongo||茶屋街|chayagai|literally "tea house district", often referred to as "entertainment district"}}. In the 1920s, there were over 80,000 geisha in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggmbp2pv8toC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=182 |title=Kyoto: a cultural history |first=John |last=Dougill |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-530137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=639 |title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc |year=2000 |isbn=0-87779-017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today, there are far fewer. Most common sightings are of tourists who pay a fee to be dressed up as a maiko.&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST23171020080423?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Modern-day geisha triumphs in closed, traditional world |last=Lies |first=Elaine |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2009 |website=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sluggish economy, declining interest in the traditional arts, the exclusive nature of the flower and willow world, and the expense of being entertained by geisha have all contributed to the tradition's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |quote=An economic downturn in the 1990s forced businessmen to cut back on entertainment expenses, while high-profile scandals in recent years have made politicians eschew excessive spending.

[[File:Ichiriki entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Ichiriki Ochaya]], one of the most famous tea houses where ''geiko'' entertain in Gion Kobu]]
Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at {{nihongo||お茶屋|[[ochaya]]|literally "tea houses"}} or at traditional Japanese restaurants (ryōtei).&lt;ref name="kalman"/&gt; The charge for a geisha's time, which used to be determined by [[Incense clock#Stick incense clocks|measuring a burning incense stick]], is called ''senkōdai'' ({{nihongo2|線香代}}, "incense stick fee") or gyokudai ({{nihongo2|玉代}} "jewel fee"). Now they are flat fees charged by the hour. In Kyoto, the terms ''ohana'' ({{nihongo2|お花}}) and ''hanadai'' ({{nihongo2|花代}}), meaning "flower fees", are preferred. The okasan makes arrangements through the geisha union office ({{nihongo2|検番}} ''kenban''), which keeps each geisha's schedule and makes her appointments both for entertaining and for training.

==Non-Japanese Geisha==
Since the 1970s, non-Japanese have also attempted to become geishas.  
[[Liza Dalby]], an American national worked briefly with geisha in the [[Pontocho]] district of [[Kyoto]] as part of her doctorate research, although she did not formally debut as a geisha herself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyslop |first=Leah |title=Liza Dalby, the blue-eyed geisha |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8008802/Liza-Dalby-the-blue-eyed-geisha.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 July 2011 |location=London |date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liza |first=Dalby |title=Geisha |year=1983 |publisher=Vintage U.K. |location=London |isbn=9780099286387 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The district of [[Gion]] in [[Kyoto, Japan]] does not accept non-Japanese women to train for becoming a geisha due to their ultra–traditionalist environment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Other foreign nationals who have completed training and worked as geisha in Japan include the following:

==Public performances==
While traditionally geishas have led a cloistered existence, in recent years they have become more publicly visible, and entertainment is available without requiring the traditional introduction and connections.

The most visible form of this are public dances, or ''[[Japanese traditional dance|odori]]'' (generally written in [[Historical kana orthography|traditional kana spelling]] as をどり, rather than modern おどり), featuring both maikos and geishas.

==Arts==

[[File:Two geishas playing shamisen.jpg|thumb|''Geisha'' Komomo and Mameyoshi from Gion Kobu playing ''shamisen'']]
Geisha begin their study of music and dance when they are very young and continue it throughout their lives. Geisha can work into their eighties and nineties,&lt;ref name="kyotox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |date=3 December 2007 |quote=Girls in the past could become apprentice geishas from the age of 13, but it is now illegal to become an apprentice before 18 except in Kyoto where a girl can be an apprentice at 15. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to train every day even after seventy years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=Even the older sisters who became geisha as teenagers, they are [now] over 80 but still train every day |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance of the geisha has evolved from the dance performed on the noh and kabuki stages. The "wild and outrageous" dances transformed into a more subtle, stylized, and controlled form of dance. It is extremely disciplined, similar to [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]]. Every dance uses gestures to tell a story and only a connoisseur can understand the subdued symbolism. For example, a tiny hand gesture represents reading a love letter, holding the corner of a handkerchief in the mouth represents coquetry and the long sleeves of the elaborate kimono are often used to symbolize dabbing tears.&lt;ref name="Downer"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lesley |last=Downer |chapter=The City Geisha and Their Role in Modern Japan: Anomaly or artistes  |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=23 March 2006 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-517029-0 |pages=223–242}}{{Vague|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Let's have precise page numbers --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances are accompanied by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument is the [[shamisen]]. The shamisen was introduced to the geisha culture in 1750 and has been mastered by female Japanese artists for years.&lt;ref name=Maske&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maske |first=Andrew L. |title=Geisha: Beyond the Painted Smile |location=Peabody |publisher=[[Peabody Essex Museum]] |date=2004 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shamisen, originating in Okinawa, is a banjo-like three-stringed instrument that is played with a [[Plectrum#Non-Western instruments|plectrum]]. It has a very distinct, melancholy sound that is often accompanied by flute. The instrument is described as "melancholy" because traditional shamisen music uses only [[minor third]]s and sixths.&lt;ref name=Maske/&gt; All geisha must learn shamisen-playing, though it takes years to master. Along with the shamisen and the flute, geisha also learned to play a ''[[Tsuzumi|ko-tsuzumi]]'', a small, [[hourglass drum|hourglass-shaped]] shoulder drum, and a large floor ''[[taiko]]'' (drum). Some geisha would not only dance and play music, but would write beautiful, melancholy poems. Others painted pictures or composed music.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

==Geisha and prostitution==
Sheridan Prasso wrote that Americans had "an incorrect impression of the real geisha world ... geisha means 'arts person' trained in music and dance, not in the art of sexual pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Asian-Mystique-Fantasies-ebook/dp/B0036FTOBW |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |last=Prasso |first=Sheridan |date=April 2009 |location=New York |publisher=Public Affairs |isbn=978-1-58648-214-5 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.&amp;nbsp;G. Henshall wrote that the geisha's purpose was "to entertain their customer, be it by dancing, reciting verse, playing musical instruments, or engaging in light conversation. Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful [[innuendo]]s; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected. In a social style that is common in Japan, men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be."&lt;ref name="Henshall"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henshall |first=K. G. |date=1999 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |isbn=0-333-74940-5 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the new government passed a law liberating "prostitutes (shōgi) and geisha (geigi)". The wording of this statute was the subject of controversy. Some officials thought that prostitutes and geisha worked at different ends of the same profession—selling sex— and that all prostitutes should henceforth be called "geisha". In the end, the government decided to maintain a line between the two groups, arguing that geisha were more refined and should not be soiled by association with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Matsugu"&gt;{{cite book |first=Miho |last=Matsugu |chapter=In the Service of the Nation: Geisha and Kawabata Yasunari's 'Snow Country' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=2006 |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517028-8 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, geisha working in ''[[onsen]]'' towns such as [[Atami]] are dubbed [[onsen geisha]]. Onsen geisha have been given a bad reputation due to the prevalence of prostitutes in such towns who market themselves as "geisha". In contrast to these "one-night geisha", the true onsen geisha are competent dancers and musicians. However, the [[Autobiography of a Geisha|autobiography of Sayo Masuda]], an onsen geisha who worked in Nagano Prefecture in the 1930s, reveals that in the past, such women were often under intense pressure to sell sex.&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"/&gt;

===Personal relationships and Danna partnership===
Geisha are portrayed as unattached. Formerly those who chose to marry had to retire from the profession, though today, some geisha are allowed to marry. It was traditional in the past for established geisha to take a ''danna'', or patron. A ''danna'' was typically a wealthy man, sometimes married, who had the means to support the very large expenses related to a geisha's traditional training and other costs. This sometimes occurs today as well, but very rarely. A geisha and her danna may or may not be in love, but intimacy is never viewed as a reward for the danna's financial support. While it is true that a geisha is free to pursue personal relationships with men she meets through her work, such relationships are carefully chosen and unlikely to be casual. A hanamachi tends to be a very tight-knit community and a geisha's good reputation is not taken lightly.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==="Geisha (Gee-sha) girls"===
During the period of [[occupied Japan|the Allied occupation of Japan]], local women called "Geisha girls" worked as prostitutes. They almost exclusively serviced [[Military of the United States|American GIs]] stationed in the country, who actually referred to them as "Geesha girls" (a mispronunciation).&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Ozeki |title=Inside and other short fiction: Japanese women by Japanese women |publisher=Kodansha International |year=2005 |isbn=4-7700-3006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women dressed in ''kimono'' and imitated the look of geisha. Many Americans unfamiliar with the Japanese culture could not tell the difference between legitimate geisha and these costumed performers.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; Shortly after their arrival in 1945, some occupying American GIs are said to have congregated in [[Ginza]] and shouted, "We want geesha girls!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Booth |title=Looking for the Lost: Journeys Through a Vanishing Japan |publisher=Kodansha Globe Series |date=1995 |isbn=1-56836-148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, the English term "geisha girl" became a general word for any female Japanese prostitute or worker in the [[mizu shōbai]] and included [[Hostess bar|bar hostesses]] and [[streetwalker]]s.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

Geisha girls are speculated by [[Japanology|researchers]] to be largely responsible for the continuing misconception in [[Western world|the West]] that all geisha are engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

===Mizuage===
{{Main article|Mizuage}}
'''Mizuage''' ({{nihongo2|水揚げ}}) was a ceremony undergone by a maiko where she was promoted to [[senior status]] and changed her hairstyle from the junior wareshinobu to the senior ofuku.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; A ritual deflowering, also called mizuage, was practiced among prostitutes and geisha in smaller towns where these occupations often blurred lines. Prostitutes posing as geisha often used this term to refer to their acts with customers, which lead to great confusion when such prostitutes often called themselves "geisha" in the company of foreign soldiers and even Japanese customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geishaofjapan.com/history/world-war-ii-and-the-american-occupation/ |title=World War II and the American Occupation |website=Geisha of Japan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mizuage literally means "raising the waters" and originally meant unloading a ship's cargo of fish.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite book |title=East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir through the Seasons by Liza Dalby |date=February 2009 |authorlink=Liza Dalby |first=L. |last=Dalby |publisher=University of California Press |chapter=Waters dry up |isbn=978-0-520-25991-1 |pages=190–191 |quote=The resulting official line that geisha live by art alone is unrealistically [[prude|prudish]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the word came to represent money earned in the entertainment business.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

==Appearance==

[[File:Maiko in Gion.jpg|thumb|The ''maiko'' Mamechiho in the Gion district. Notice the green pin on the mid-left called ''tsunagi-dango'': this identifies her as a maiko of Gion kobu under 18.]]
A geisha's appearance changes throughout her career, from the girlish, heavily made-up maiko, to the more somber appearance of an older established geisha. Different hairstyles and hairpins signify different stages of a girl's development and even a detail as minute as the length of one's eyebrows is significant. Short eyebrows are for the young and long eyebrows display maturity.&lt;ref name=Prasso&gt;Prasso, Sheridan. "The Asian Mystique." New York: Public Affairs, 2005:206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
{{Further information|History of cosmetics}}
In modern times the traditional makeup of apprentice geisha is one of their most recognizable characteristics, though established geisha generally only wear full white face makeup characteristic of maiko during special performances.

The traditional makeup of an apprentice geisha features a thick white base with red [[lipstick]] and red and black accents around the eyes and eyebrows. Originally, the white base mask was made with lead; after the discovery that it poisoned the skin and caused terrible skin and back problems for the older geisha towards the end of the [[Meiji period|Meiji Era]], it was replaced with rice powder.

The application of makeup is hard to perfect and is time-consuming. Makeup is applied before dressing to avoid dirtying the kimono. First, a wax or oil substance called ''bintsuke-abura'' is applied to the skin. Next, white powder is mixed with water into a paste and applied with a bamboo brush starting from the neck and working upwards. The white makeup covers the face, neck, and chest, with two or three unwhitened areas (forming a ''W'' or ''V'' shape, usually a traditional ''W'' shape) left on the [[nape]], to accentuate this traditionally erotic area, and a line of bare skin around the hairline, which creates the illusion of a mask.

After the foundation layer is applied, a sponge is patted all over the face, throat, chest, the nape and neck to remove excess moisture and to blend the foundation. Next the eyes and eyebrows are drawn in. Traditionally, charcoal was used, but today, modern cosmetics are used. The eyebrows and edges of the eyes are coloured black with a thin charcoal; a maiko also applies red around her eyes.

The lips are filled in using a small brush. The colour comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the lips luster. Rarely will a geisha colour in both lips fully in the Western style, as white creates optical illusions and colouring the lips fully would make them appear overly large. The lower lip is coloured in partially and the upper lip left white for maiko in her first year, after which the upper lip is coloured. Newly full-fledged geisha will colour in only the top lip fully. Most geisha wear the top lip coloured in fully or stylized, and the bottom lip in a curved stripe that does not follow the shape of the lip. Geisha round the bottom lips to create the illusion of a flower bud.

Maiko who are in their last stage of training sometimes [[Ohaguro|colour their teeth black]] for a brief period. This practice used to be common among married women in Japan and, earlier, at the imperial court, but survives only in some districts. It is done partly because uncoloured teeth seem very yellow in contrast to white face makeup; colouring the teeth black means that they seem to "disappear" in the darkness of the open mouth. This illusion is of course more pronounced at a distance.

For the first year, a maiko wears this heavy makeup almost constantly. During her initiation, the maiko is helped with her makeup either by her ''onee-san'', or "older sister" (an experienced geisha who is her mentor), or by the ''okaa-san'', or "mother" of her geisha house. After this, she applies the makeup herself.

After a maiko has been working for three years, she changes her make-up to a more subdued style. The reason for this is that she has now become mature, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. For formal occasions, the mature geisha will still apply white make-up. For geisha over thirty, the heavy white make-up is only worn during those special dances that require it.

===Dress===
[[File:Maiko and geisha back.jpg|thumb|A senior ''maiko'' (left) with ''darari obi'' and ''geisha'' with ''taiko-musubi'']]
[[File:Niigata geisha dancing2.jpg|thumb|Niigata ''geisha'' performing dance, dressed in ''kimono'' and ''taiko musubi'']]
Geisha always wear [[kimono]]. Apprentice geisha wear highly colourful kimono with extravagant [[Obi (sash)|obi]]. The obi is brighter than the kimono she is wearing to give a certain exotic balance. Maiko of Kyoto wear the obi tied in a style called "darari" (dangling obi), while Tokyo "hangyoku" wear it tied in various ways, including taiko musubi. Older geisha of Kyoto wear more subdued patterns and styles (most notably the obi tied in a simpler knot used by married women known as the "taiko musubi" ({{nihongo2|太鼓結び}}), or "drum knot"). Tokyo and Kanazawa geisha wear {{nihongo|"yanagi musubi"|柳結び||''willow style''}}, taiko musubi and {{nihongo|"tsunodashi musubi"|角出結び}}.

The colour, pattern, and style of ''kimono'' is dependent on the season and the event the geisha is attending. A ''kimono'' can take from two to three years to complete, due to painting and embroidering.

Geiko wear red or pink ''nagajuban'', or under-kimono. A maiko wears red with white printed patterns. The junior maiko's collar is predominantly red with white, silver, or gold embroidery. Two to three years into her apprenticeship, the red collar will be entirely embroidered in white (when viewed from the front) to show her seniority. When she becomes a fully fledged geisha her collar will turn from red to solid white.

Geisha wear raised wooden sandals, called ''[[geta (footwear)|geta]]'' while maiko wear a special wooden sandal known as ''[[okobo]]'' and wear only ''[[tabi]]'' (white split-toed socks) indoors. Geisha and apprentices wear the flat-soled sandal ''[[zōri]]'' outdoors during inclement weather.

===Hair===
[[File:Geiko - Tea ceremony.jpg|thumb|Mamechiho as a ''geiko''.]]
The hairstyles of geisha have varied through history. In the past, it has been common for women to wear their hair down in some periods and up in others. During the 17th century, women began putting all their hair up again, and it is during this time that the traditional [[shimada (hairstyle)|shimada hairstyle]], a type of [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] worn by most established geisha, developed.

There are two major types of the shimada seen in the karyukai: the ''Taka Shimada'', a high mage (high section) usually worn by young, single women and the ''Tsubushi Shimada'', a more flattened mage generally worn by older women Additional hairstyles for maiko include Wareshinobu, Ofuku, Katsuyama, Yakko Shimada, and [[Sakkō]]. Maiko of Pontocho will wear an additional six hairstyles leading up to Sakkō, including Oshidori, Kikugasane, Yuiwata, Suisha, Oshun, and Osafune.

These hairstyles are decorated with elaborate hair-combs and hairpins ([[kanzashi]]). Beginning In the seventeenth century and continuing through the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, hair-combs were large and conspicuous, generally more ornate for higher-class women. Following the Meiji Restoration and into the modern era, smaller and less conspicuous hair-combs became more popular.

Maiko sleep with their necks on small supports (takamakura), instead of pillows, so they keep their hairstyle perfect.&lt;ref name="tak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=3 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype |date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |page=3 |location=Melbourne |newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there are no accidents, a maiko will need her hair styled every week. Many modern geisha use [[wig]]s in their professional lives, while maiko use their natural hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-week-in-the-life-of-koaki-apprentice-geisha--schooled-in-the-arts-of-pleasure-1170322.html |title=A Week in the Life of: Koaki, Apprentice Geisha – Schooled in the arts of pleasure |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=8 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either must be regularly tended by highly skilled artisans. Traditional hairstyling is a slowly dying art. Over time, the hairstyle can cause balding on the top of the head.

{{nihongo||先笄|'''[[Sakkō]]'''}} is a Japanese [[hairstyle]]. It is worn by maiko today, but was worn in the [[Edo period]] by wives to show their dedication to their husbands. Maiko wear it during a ceremony called [[Erikae]], which marks their graduation from maiko to [[geiko]]. Maiko use black wax to stain their teeth as well. Crane and  [[tortoiseshell]] ornaments are added as [[kanzashi]]. The style is twisted in many knots, and is quite striking and elaborate.

==In popular culture==
A growing number of geisha have complained to the authorities about being pursued down the street and tugged on the sleeves of their kimonos by groups of tourists keen to take their photograph. As a result, residents and local businesses have joined forces to protect the geisha by launching patrols of the streets of Kyoto's Gion entertainment district in order to prevent tourists from pestering them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/4018220/Tourists-warned-to-stop-harassing-Kyotos-geisha.html |title=Tourists warned to stop 'harassing' Kyoto's geisha |first=Danielle |last=Demetriou |date=30 December 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories are told about geisha. This includes Arthur Golden's popular English-language novel ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' which was adapted into a film in 2005.

==Films==
===''Ice Age'' (2002)===
{{Main|Ice Age (2002 film)}}
Sid, a talkative sloth, is left behind by his family and the herds of mammals journeying to the south. He meets Manny, a mammoth who travels to the north, and decides to follow him. When a humans' camp is attacked by tigers, a woman takes her baby and jumps into a river and falls over a waterfall. Before she disappears, the baby is rescued by Manny and Sid. The two animals decide to search for the father and return the baby to him. Diego, one of the tigers that attacked the humans, comes also claiming the baby, and the trio form an uneasy alliance during their journey to the humans.

===''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' (2006)===
{{Main|Ice Age: The Meltdown}}
Manny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a wall that is barely holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley to nearly a mile underwater. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Manny is also having trouble fearing the fact that he may be the last mammoth left. Along the way, they meet Ellie, a mammoth who thinks she is a possum, and her possum brothers Crash and Eddie. As they begin to travel together, Manny learns, with help from Diego and Sid, that he must move on from his past. During their journey, [[Scrat]] the sabre-toothed squirrel has his own adventure.

===''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' (2009)===
{{Main|Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs}}
Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child, meanwhile Scrat falls in love with fellow squirrel Scratte. Meanwhile, Diego is anxious about settling down for a domestic life with Manny's new family. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him. The herd also meets an insane one-eyed weasel known as Buck who aids them on their quest.

===''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' (2012)===
{{Main|Ice Age: Continental Drift}}
Taking place several years after the events of the third film, with Peaches now a teenager, Scrat's pursuit of acorns has world-changing consequences, separating Manny, Sid and Diego from the rest of their group. As they try to return home, they come into conflict with a pirate gang led by Captain Gutt.

=== {{anchor|Ice_Age_5_.282016.29}}''Ice Age: Collision Course'' (2016) ===
{{Main|Ice Age: Collision Course}}
Set after the events of ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift|Continental Drift]]'', Scrat's pursuit of his elusive acorn catapults him outside of Earth aboard a UFO, where he accidentally sets off a series of cosmic events that transform and threaten the planet. To save themselves from peril, Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd leave their home and reunite with Buck, who leads them on a journey to find a way to save the planet.

===Future===
On the possibility of a potential sequel to ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', in June 2016, Galen T. Chu, co-director of the film, stated that there were some ideas for the next installment.&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickreel.com/ice-age-collision-course-interview-with-co-director-galen-t-chu/|title=ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE INTERVIEW WITH CO-DIRECTOR GALEN T. CHU|author=Cassam Looch|work=Flickreel|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Bustle noted that the potential of ''Ice Age 6'' actually being produced was relatively high even though it could largely depend on the box office performance of the fifth film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/172484-will-there-be-another-ice-age-movie-this-franchise-is-staying-strong|title=Will There Be Another Ice Age Movie? This Franchise Is Staying Strong|author=Johnny Brayson|work=Bustle|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PopWrapped later commented in February 2017, on the fifth film's poor reception and how the franchise was moving further into absurdity and further away from leaving any lasting emotional impact on the audience, and stated that the sixth film could have potential to redeem the franchise by going back to its roots and reintroducing the humans from the original film, particularly the little baby named Roshan, and thereby bring the audience to remember why they loved ''Ice Age'' so much in the first place, and perhaps end the series on a high note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://popwrapped.com/ice-age-6|title=Why There Should Be An 'Ice Age 6' And How To Make It Great|author=Landon Abernathy|work=PopWrapped|date=February 18, 2017|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dastardly pirate bunny Squint, who is seeking revenge on the herd, steals, camouflages and hides all the eggs. Once again, with Squint’s twin brother, Clint, assisting, Manny, Diego and the rest of the gang come to the rescue and take off on a daring mission that turns into the world’s first Easter egg hunt.

[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and  [[Bill Clinton]] enjoying a joke, in spite of their language differences]]
A '''joke''' is a display of [[humour]] in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people [[laughter|laugh]] and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a [[punch line]]. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a [[pun]] or other word play such as [[irony]], a logical incompatibility, nonsense, or other means.  Linguist [[Robert Hetzron]] offers the definition:

{{quote|A joke is a short humorous piece of oral literature in which the funniness culminates in the final sentence, called the punchline… In fact, the main condition is that the tension should reach its highest level at the very end. No continuation relieving the tension should be added. As for its being "oral," it is true that jokes may appear printed, but when further transferred, there is no obligation to reproduce the text verbatim, as in the case of poetry.{{sfn|Hetzron|1991| pp=65–66}}}}

It is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. In the case of [[riddle joke]]s or one-liners the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humor—the [[shaggy dog story]] is in a class of its own as an [[anti-humor|anti-joke]]; although presenting as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a  punchline. Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is a joke. Some humorous forms which are ''not'' verbal jokes are:  involuntary humour, situational humour, [[practical jokes]], [[slapstick]] and anecdotes.

Identified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist {{Interlanguage link multi|André Jolles|de|3=Johannes Andreas Jolles}},{{sfn|Jolles|1930}} jokes are passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, [[Internet humor|through the internet]].

[[Stand-up]] comics, [[comedians]] and [[slapstick]] work with [[comic timing]], precision and [[rhythm]] in their performance, relying as much on actions as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the printed joke ==
[[File:PapyrusWestcar photomerge-AltesMuseum-Berlin-5.jpg|right|upright=1.7|thumb|The [[Westcar Papyrus]], dating to {{circa}} 1600 BC, contains an example of one of the earliest surviving jokes.{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}]]

Any joke documented from the past has been saved through happenstance rather than design. Jokes do not belong to refined culture, but rather to the entertainment and leisure of all classes. As such, any printed versions were considered [[ephemera]], i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. Many of these early jokes deal with scatological and sexual topics, entertaining to all social classes but not to be valued and saved.

Various kinds of jokes have been identified in ancient pre-[[Classical antiquity|classical]] texts.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 2008, British TV channel [[Dave (TV channel)|''Dave'']] commissioned a team of academics, led by humour expert Paul McDonald from the [[University of Wolverhampton]], to research the world’s oldest examples of recorded humour. Because humour may difficult to define their condition was "a clear set-up and punch line structure". In review, McDonald stated: "...&amp;nbsp;jokes have varied over the years, with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles.  What they all share however, is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion. Modern puns, Essex girl jokes and toilet humour can all be traced back to the very earliest jokes identified in this research."{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest identified joke is an ancient [[Sumer]]ian [[proverb]] from 1900 BC containing [[toilet humour]]: "Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap." Its records were dated to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] and the joke may go as far back as 2300 BC. The second oldest joke found, discovered on the [[Westcar Papyrus]] and believed to be about [[Sneferu]], was from [[Ancient Egypt]] circa 1600 BC: "How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish." The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known oldest jokes in the world. This is a [[Rule of three (writing)#Comedy|comic triple]] dating back to 1200 BC [[Adab (city)|Adab]].{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}

The earliest extant joke book is the ''[[Philogelos]]'' (Greek for ''The Laughter-Lover''), a collection of 265 jokes written in crude [[ancient Greek]] dating to the fourth or fifth century AD.{{sfn|Adams|2008}}{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=185}} The author of the collection is obscure{{sfn|Beard|2014|pages=186-188}} and a number of different authors are attributed to it, including "Hierokles and Philagros the ''grammatikos''", just "Hierokles", or, in the ''[[Suda]]'', "Philistion".{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=188}} British classicist [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] states that the ''Philogelos'' may have been intended as a jokester's handbook of quips to say on the fly, rather than a book meant to be read straight through.{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=188}} Many of the jokes in this collection are surprisingly familiar, even though the typical protagonists are less recognisable to contemporary readers: the [[absent-minded professor]], the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad breath.{{sfn|Adams|2008}} The ''Philogelos'' even contains a joke similar to [[Monty Python]]'s "[[Dead Parrot Sketch]]".{{sfn|Adams|2008}}

[[File:Houghton Typ 520.97.225 - Icones quinquaginta virorum illustrium - Poggio Bracciolini.jpg|thumb|1597 engraving of Poggio Bracciolini]]

[[early modern period|During the 15th century]],{{sfn|Ward|Waller|2000}} the [[Printing press#The Printing Revolution|printing revolution]] spread across Europe following the development of the [[History of printing#Movable type|movable type printing press]]. This was coupled with the growth of literacy in all social classes. Printers turned out [[Jestbook]]s along with Bibles to meet both [[low culture|lowbrow]] and [[highbrow]] interests of the populace. One early anthology of jokes was the [[Facetiae]] by the Italian [[Poggio Bracciolini]], first published in 1470. The popularity of this jest book can be measured on the twenty editions of the book documented alone for the 15th century. Another popular form was a collection of jests, jokes and funny situations attributed to a single character in a more connected, narrative form of the [[picaresque]] novel. Examples of this are the characters of [[Rabelais]] in France, [[Till Eulenspiegel]] in Germany, [[Lazarillo de Tormes]] in Spain and [[John Skelton|Master Skelton]] in England. There is also a jest book ascribed to [[Shakespeare's Jest Book|William Shakespeare]], the contents of which appear to both inform and borrow from his plays. All of these early jestbooks corroborate both the rise in the literacy of the European populations and the general quest for leisure activities during the Renaissance in Europe.{{sfn|Ward|Waller|2000}}

The practice of printers to use jokes and cartoons as page fillers was also widely used in the [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] and [[chapbook]]s of the 19th century and earlier. With the increase in literacy in the general population and the growth of the printing industry, these publications were the most common forms of printed material between the 16th and 19th centuries throughout Europe and North America. Along with reports of events, executions, ballads and verse, they also contained jokes. Only one of many broadsides archived in the Harvard library is described as "1706. Grinning made easy; or, Funny Dick's unrivalled collection of curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and eccentric jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, &amp;c. With many other descriptions of wit and humour."{{sfn|Lane|1905}} These cheap publications, ephemera intended for mass distribution, were read alone, read aloud, posted and discarded.

There are many types of joke books in print today; a search on the internet provides a plethora of titles available for purchase. They can be read alone for solitary entertainment, or used to stock up on new jokes to entertain friends. Some people try to find a deeper meaning in jokes, as in "Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar... Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes".{{sfn|Cathcart|Klein| 2007}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;NPR Interview with the authors Cathcart and Klein can be found at https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10158510&lt;/ref&gt; However a deeper meaning is not necessary to appreciate their inherent entertainment value.{{sfn|Berry|2013}} Magazines frequently use jokes and cartoons as filler for the printed page. ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' closes out many articles with an (unrelated) joke at the bottom of the article. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was first published in 1925 with the stated goal of being a "sophisticated humour magazine" and is still known for [[The New Yorker#Cartoons|its cartoons]].

== Telling jokes ==
Telling a joke is a cooperative effort;{{sfn|Raskin|1985| p=103}}{{sfn|Attardo|Chabanne|1992}} it requires that the teller and the audience mutually agree in one form or another to understand the narrative which follows as a joke. In a study of [[conversation analysis]], the sociologist [[Harvey Sacks]] describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke. "This telling is composed, as for stories, of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences … the preface [framing], the telling, and the response sequences."{{sfn|Sacks|1974| pp=337–353}} Folklorists expand this to include the context of the joking. Who is telling what jokes to whom? And why is he telling them when?{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pp=20–32}}{{sfn|Bauman|1975}} The context of the joke telling in turn leads into a study of [[joking relationship]]s, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who engage in institutionalised banter and joking.

=== Framing: "Have you heard the one…" ===
[[Frame analysis|Framing]] is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. "Have you heard the one…", "Reminds me of a joke I heard…", "So, a lawyer and a doctor…"; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows.{{sfn|Sims|Stephens|2005|p=141}} Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in "this is no joking matter" or "this is no time for jokes".

Within its performance frame, joke-telling is labelled as a culturally [[marked]] form of communication.  Both the performer and audience understand it to be set apart from the "real" world. "An elephant walks into a bar…"; a native English speaker automatically understands that this is the start of a joke, and the story that follows is not meant to be taken at face value (i.e. it is non-bona-fide communication).{{sfn|Raskin|1992}} The framing itself invokes a play mode; if the audience is unable or unwilling to move into play, then nothing will seem funny.{{sfnm |1a1=Ellis |1y=2002 |1p=3 |2a1=Marcus |2y=2001}}

=== Telling ===
Following its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.{{sfn|Toelken|1996|p=55}}

The narrative always contains a protagonist who becomes the "butt" or target of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes within the culture. It also enables researchers to group and analyse the creation, persistence and interpretation of joke cycles around a certain character. Some people are naturally better performers than others, however anyone can tell a joke because the comic trigger is contained in the narrative text and punchline. A joke poorly told is still funny unless the punchline gets mangled.

=== Punchline ===
The punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline / response is elucidated by [[Victor Raskin]] in his [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour]]. Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. "The punchline is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text."{{sfn|Carrell|2008|p=308}} To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text '''AND''' opposite or incompatible with each other.{{sfn|Raskin|1985|p=99}} Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin's linguistic theory to include "two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution." He explains that "… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity."{{sfnm |1a1=Shultz |1y=1976 |1pp=12–13 |2a1=Carrell |2y=2008 |2p=312}} Resolution generates laughter.

This is the point at which the field of [[neurolinguistics]] offers some insight into the cognitive processing involved in this abrupt laughter at the punchline. Studies by the cognitive science researchers Coulson and [[Marta Kutas|Kutas]] directly address the theory of script switching articulated by Raskin in their work.{{sfn|Coulson|Kutas|1998}} The article "Getting it: Human event-related brain response to jokes in good and poor comprehenders" measures brain activity in response to reading jokes.{{sfn|Coulson|Kutas|2001|pp=71–74}} Additional studies by others in the field support more generally the theory of two-stage processing of humour, as evidenced in the longer processing time they require.{{sfn|Attardo|2008|pp=125–126}} In the related field of [[neuroscience]], it has been shown that the expression of laughter is caused by two partially independent neuronal pathways: an "involuntary" or "emotionally driven" system and a "voluntary" system.{{sfn|Wild|Rodden|Grodd|Ruch|2003}} This study adds credence to the common experience when exposed to an [[off-color humor|off-colour]] joke; a laugh is followed in the next breath by a disclaimer: "Oh, that's bad…" Here the multiple steps in cognition are clearly evident in the stepped response, the perception being processed just a breath faster than the resolution of the moral / ethical content in the joke.

=== Responding ===
Expected response to a joke is laughter. The joke teller hopes the audience "gets it" and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an "understanding test" between individuals and groups.{{sfn|Sacks|1974|p=350}} If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do "get it" and don't laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a joke told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same joke overheard in a women's lavatory. A joke involving [[toilet humour]] may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same joke will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the joke remains the same, however it is more or less appropriate depending on the current context.

=== Shifting contexts, shifting texts ===
The context explores the specific social situation in which joking occurs.{{sfn|Dundes|1980|p=23}} The narrator automatically modifies the text of the joke to be acceptable to different audiences, while at the same time supporting the same divergent scripts in the punchline. The vocabulary used in telling the same joke at a university fraternity party and to one's grandmother might well vary. In each situation it is important to identify both the narrator and the audience as well as their relationship with each other. This varies to reflect the complexities of a matrix of different social factors: age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political views, religion, power relationship, etc. When all the potential combinations of such factors between the narrator and the audience are considered, then a single joke can take on infinite shades of meaning for each unique social setting.

The context, however, should not be confused with the function of the joking. "Function is essentially an abstraction made on the basis of a number of contexts".{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pp=23–24}} In one long-term observation of men coming off the late shift at a local café, joking with the waitresses was used to ascertain sexual availability for the evening. Different types of jokes, going from general to topical into explicitly sexual humour signalled openness on the part of the waitress for a connection.{{sfnm |1a1=Walle |1y=1976 |2a1=Oring |2y=2008 |2p=201}} This study describes how jokes and joking are used to communicate much more than just good humour. That is a single example of the function of joking in a social setting, but there are others. Sometimes jokes are used simply to get to know someone better. What makes them laugh, what do they find funny? Jokes concerning politics, religion or sexual topics can be used effectively to gage the attitude of the audience to any one of these topics. They can also be used as a marker of group identity, signalling either inclusion or exclusion for the group. Among pre-adolescents, "dirty" jokes allow them to share information about their changing bodies.{{sfn|Sims|Stephens|2005|p=39}} And sometimes joking is just simple entertainment for a group of friends.

=== Joking relationships ===
The context of joking in turn leads into a study of [[joking relationship]]s, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who take part in institutionalised banter and joking. These relationships can be either one-way or a mutual back and forth between partners. "The joking relationship is defined as a peculiar combination of friendliness and antagonism. The behaviour is such that in any other social context it would express and arouse hostility; but it is not meant seriously and must not be taken seriously. There is a pretence of hostility along with a real friendliness. To put it in another way, the relationship is one of permitted disrespect."{{sfn| Radcliffe-Brown |1940|p=196}} Joking relationships were first described by anthropologists within kinship groups in Africa. But they have since been identified in cultures around the world, where jokes and joking are used to mark and re-inforce appropriate boundaries of a relationship.{{sfn|Apte|1985}}

== Electronic joking ==
The advent of [[electronic communication]]s at the end of the 20th century introduced new traditions into jokes. A verbal joke or cartoon is [[email]]ed to a friend or posted on a [[bulletin board]]; reactions include a replied email with [[Smiley|a :-)]] or [[LOL]], or a [[Email forwarding|forward]] on to further recipients. Interaction is limited to the computer screen and for the most part solitary. While preserving the text of a joke, both context and variants are lost in internet joking; for the most part emailed jokes are passed along verbatim.{{sfn|Frank|2009|pp=99–100}} The framing of the joke frequently occurs in the subject line: "RE: laugh for the day" or something similar. The forward of an email joke can increase the number of recipients exponentially.

[[Internet humor|Internet joking]] forces a re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They are no longer only defined by physical presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace.{{sfn|Mason|1998}} "The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with".{{sfn|Dorst|1990|pp=180–181}} This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, "that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event … flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh maimings and new collective tragedies".{{sfn|Dorst|1990}} This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an "active folkloric space" with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.{{sfn|Dorst|1990| p=183}}

A study by the folklorist Bill Ellis documented how an evolving cycle was circulated over the internet.{{sfn|Ellis|2002}} By accessing message boards that specialised in humour immediately following the 9/11 disaster, Ellis was able to observe in real time both the topical jokes being posted electronically and responses to the jokes. "Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful".{{sfn|Ellis|2002|p=2}} Access to archived message boards also enables us to track the development of a single joke thread in the context of a more complicated virtual conversation.{{sfn|Ellis|2002}}

== Joke cycles ==
{{main category|Joke cycles}}
A '''joke cycle''' is a collection of jokes about a single target or situation which displays consistent narrative structure and type of humour. Some well-known cycles are [[elephant joke]]s using nonsense humour, [[dead baby jokes]] incorporating black humour and [[light bulb jokes]], which describe all kinds of operational stupidity. Joke cycles can centre on ethnic groups, professions ([[viola jokes]]), catastrophes, settings [[Bar joke|(…walks into a bar)]], absurd characters ([[Wind-up doll joke|wind-up dolls]]), or logical mechanisms which generate the humour ([[knock-knock jokes]]). A joke can be reused in different joke cycles; an example of this is the same [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] joke refitted to the tragedies of [[Vic Morrow]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Admiral Mountbatten]] and the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger space shuttle]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;How do we know that ___ had dandruff? They found his/her head and shoulders on the ___.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gruner|1997|pp=142–143}} These cycles seem to appear spontaneously, spread rapidly across countries and borders only to dissipate after some time. Folklorists and others have studied individual joke cycles in an attempt to understand their function and significance within the culture.

=== Tragedies and catastrophes ===
As with the [[9/11]] disaster discussed above, cycles attach themselves to celebrities or national catastrophes such as the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], the [[death of Michael Jackson]], and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]]. These cycles arise regularly as a response to terrible unexpected events which command the national news. An in-depth analysis of the Challenger joke cycle documents a change in the type of humour circulated following the disaster, from February to March 1986. "It shows that the jokes appeared in distinct 'waves', the first responding to the disaster with clever wordplay and the second playing with grim and troubling images associated with the event…The primary social function of disaster jokes appears to be to provide closure to an event that provoked communal grieving, by signaling that it was time to move on and pay attention to more immediate concerns".{{sfn|Ellis|1991}}

=== Ethnic jokes ===
The sociologist [[Christie Davies]] has written extensively on ethnic jokes told in countries around the world.{{sfn|Davies|1990}} In ethnic jokes he finds that the "stupid" ethnic target in the joke is no stranger to the culture, but rather a peripheral social group (geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic) well known to the joke tellers.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pages=163–165}} So Americans tell jokes about Polacks and Italians, Germans tell jokes about Ostfriesens, and the English tell jokes about the Irish. In a review of Davies' theories it is said that "For Davies, [ethnic] jokes are more about how joke tellers imagine themselves than about how they imagine those others who serve as their putative targets…The jokes thus serve to center one in the world – to remind people of their place and to reassure them that they are in it."{{sfn|Oring|2000}}

=== Absurdities and gallows humour ===
A third category of joke cycles identifies absurd characters as the butt: for example the grape, the dead baby or the elephant. Beginning in the 1960s, social and cultural interpretations of these joke cycles, spearheaded by the folklorist [[Alan Dundes]], began to appear in academic journals. Dead baby jokes are posited to reflect societal changes and guilt caused by widespread use of contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Contraceptive pills]] were first approved for use in the United States in 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundes|1987|pp=3–14}} Elephant jokes have been interpreted variously as stand-ins for American blacks during the Civil Rights Era{{sfn|Dundes|1987|pp=41–54}} or as an "image of something large and wild abroad in the land captur[ing] the sense of counterculture" of the sixties.{{sfn|Oring|2008|p=194}} These interpretations strive for a cultural understanding of the themes of these jokes which go beyond the simple collection and documentation undertaken previously by folklorists and ethnologists.

== Classification systems ==
As folktales and other types of oral literature became collectibles throughout Europe in the 19th century ([[Brothers Grimm]] et al.), folklorists and anthropologists of the time needed a system to organise these items. The [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] was first published in 1910 by [[Antti Aarne]], and later expanded by [[Stith Thompson]] to become the most renowned classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. Its final section addresses [[Aarne–Thompson classification system#Anecdotes and jokes|anecdotes and jokes]], listing traditional humorous tales ordered by their protagonist; "This section of the Index is essentially a classification of the older European jests, or merry tales – humorous stories characterized by short, fairly simple plots. …"{{sfnm |1a1=Brunvand |1y=1968 |1p=238 |2a1=Dundes |2y=1997}} Due to its focus on older tale types and obsolete actors (e.g., numbskull), the Aarne–Thompson Index does not provide much help in identifying and classifying the modern joke.

A more granular classification system used widely by folklorists and cultural anthropologists is the [[Motif (folkloristics)#Thompson.E2.80.99s Motif-Index|Thompson Motif Index]], which separates tales into their individual [[Motif (folkloristics)|story elements]]. This system enables jokes to be classified according to individual motifs included in the narrative: actors, items and incidents. It does not provide a system to classify the text by more than one element at a time while at the same time making it theoretically possible to classify the same text under multiple motifs.{{sfn|Dundes|1997}}

The Thompson Motif Index has spawned further specialised motif indices, each of which focuses on a single aspect of one subset of jokes. A sampling of just a few of these specialised indices have been listed under [[Motif (folkloristics)#Other motif indices|other motif indices]]. Here one can select an index for medieval Spanish folk narratives,{{sfn|Goldberg|1998}} another index for linguistic verbal jokes,{{sfn|Lew|1996}} and a third one for sexual humour.{{sfn|Legman|1968}} To assist the researcher with this increasingly confusing situation, there are also multiple bibliographies of indices{{sfn|Azzolina|1987}} as well as a how-to guide on creating your own index.{{sfn|Jason|2000}}

Several difficulties have been identified with these systems of identifying oral narratives according to either tale types or story elements.{{sfn|Apo|1997}} A first major problem is their hierarchical organisation; one element of the narrative is selected as the major element, while all other parts are arrayed subordinate to this. A second problem with these systems is that the listed motifs are not qualitatively equal; actors, items and incidents are all considered side-by-side.{{sfn|Dundes| 1962}} And because incidents will always have at least one actor and usually have an item, most narratives can be ordered under multiple headings. This leads to confusion about both where to order an item and where to find it. A third significant problem is that the "excessive prudery" common in the middle of the 20th century means that obscene, sexual and scatological elements were regularly ignored in many of the indices.{{sfn|Dundes|1997|p=198}}

The folklorist Robert Georges has summed up the concerns with these existing classification systems: {{quote|…Yet what the multiplicity and variety of sets and subsets reveal is that folklore [jokes] not only takes many forms, but that it is also multifaceted, with purpose, use, structure, content, style, and function all being relevant and important. Any one or combination of these multiple and varied aspects of a folklore example [such as jokes] might emerge as dominant in a specific situation or for a particular inquiry.{{sfn|Georges|1997|page=111}}}} It has proven difficult to organise all different elements of a joke into a multi-dimensional classification system which could be of real value in the study and evaluation of this (primarily oral) complex narrative form.

The [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humour]] or GTVH, developed by the linguists [[Victor Raskin]] and [[Salvatore Attardo]], attempts to do exactly this. This classification system was developed specifically for jokes and later expanded to include longer types of humorous narratives.{{sfn|Attardo|2001}} Six different aspects of the narrative, labelled Knowledge Resources or KRs, can be evaluated largely independently of each other, and then combined into a concatenated classification label. These six KRs of the joke structure include: 
# '''Script Opposition (SO)''' references the script opposition included in Raskin's SSTH. This includes, among others, themes such as real (unreal), actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible). 
# '''Logical Mechanism (LM)''' refers to the mechanism which connects the different scripts in the joke. These can range from a simple verbal technique like a pun to more complex LMs such as faulty logic or false analogies. 
# '''Situation (SI)''' can include objects, activities, instruments, props needed to tell the story. 
# '''Target (TA)''' identifies the actor(s) who become the "butt" of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes of ethnic groups, professions, etc.
# '''Narrative strategy (NS)''' addresses the narrative format of the joke, as either a simple narrative, a dialogue, or a riddle. It attempts to classify the different genres and subgenres of verbal humour. In a subsequent study Attardo expands the NS to include oral and printed humorous narratives of any length, not just jokes.{{sfn|Attardo|2001}}
# '''Language (LA) ''' "…contains all the information necessary for the verbalization of a text. It is responsible for the exact wording …and for the placement of the functional elements."{{sfn|Attardo|1994|p=223}}

As development of the GTVH progressed, a hierarchy of the KRs was established to partially restrict the options for lower level KRs depending on the KRs defined above them. For example, a lightbulb joke (SI) will always be in the form of a riddle (NS). Outside of these restrictions, the KRs can create a multitude of combinations, enabling a researcher to select jokes for analysis which contain only one or two defined KRs. It also allows for an evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of jokes depending on the similarity of their labels. "The GTVH presents itself as a mechanism … of generating [or describing] an infinite number of jokes by combining the various values that each parameter can take. … Descriptively, to analyze a joke in the GTVH consists of listing the values of the 6 KRs (with the caveat that TA and LM may be empty)."{{sfn|Attardo|2001|p=27}} This classification system provides a functional multi-dimensional label for any joke, and indeed any verbal humour.

== Joke and humour research ==
Many academic disciplines lay claim to the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately there are enough jokes, good, bad and worse, to go around. Unfortunately the studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines brings to mind the tale of the [[blind men and an elephant]] where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety.  This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself.{{sfn|Attardo|Chabanne|1992|p=172}} It requires a "multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry"{{sfn|Apte|1988|p=7}} to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Our focus here is with the contemporary state of joke research. A more extensive survey of the history of various humour theories can be found under the topic [[theories of humor]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundes|1972}}

=== Psychology ===
[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
Sigmund Freud was one of the first modern scholars to recognise jokes as an important object of investigation.{{sfn|Carrell|2008|p=304}} In his 1905 study ''[[Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]''{{sfn|Freud|1905}} Freud describes the social nature of humour and illustrates his text with many examples of contemporary Viennese jokes.{{sfn|Oring|1984}} His work is particularly noteworthy in this context because Freud distinguishes in his writings between jokes, humour and the comic.{{sfn|Morreall|2008|p=224}} These are distinctions which become easily blurred in many subsequent studies where everything funny tends to be gathered under the umbrella term of "humour", making for a much more diffuse discussion.

Since the publication of Freud's study, psychologists have continued to explore humour and jokes in their quest to explain, predict and control an individual's "sense of humour". Why do people laugh? Why do people find something funny? Can jokes predict character, or vice versa, can character predict the jokes an individual laughs at? What is a "sense of humour"? A current review of the popular magazine ''[[Psychology Today]]'' lists over 200 articles discussing various aspects of humour; in psychospeak{{neologism inline|date=October 2016}} the subject area has become both an emotion to measure and a tool to use in diagnostics and treatment. A new psychological assessment tool, the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action Inventory]] developed by the American psychologists [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] includes humour (and playfulness) as one of the core character strengths of an individual. As such, it could be a good predictor of life satisfaction.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=47}} For psychologists, it would be useful to measure both how much of this strength an individual has and how it can be measurably increased.

A 2007 survey of existing tools to measure humour identified more than 60 psychological measurement instruments.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=58}} These measurement tools use many different approaches to quantify humour along with its related states and traits. There are tools to measure an individual's physical response by their [[smile]]; the [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS) is one of several tools used to identify any one of multiple types of smiles.{{sfn|Furnham|2014}} Or the [[laugh]] can be measured to calculate the funniness response of an individual; multiple [[Laughter#Types|types of laughter]] have been identified. It must be stressed here that both smiles and laughter are not always a response to something funny. In trying to develop a measurement tool, most systems use "jokes and cartoons" as their test materials. However, because no two tools use the same jokes, and across languages this would not be feasible, how does one determine that the assessment objects are comparable? Moving on, whom does one ask to rate the sense of humour of an individual? Does one ask the person themselves, an impartial observer, or their family, friends and colleagues? Furthermore, has the current mood of the test subjects been considered; someone with a recent death in the family might not be much prone to laughter. Given the plethora of variants revealed by even a superficial glance at the problem,{{sfn|Ruch|2008|pp=40–45}} it becomes evident that these paths of scientific inquiry are mined with problematic pitfalls and questionable solutions.

The psychologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Willibald Ruch|de}} has been very active in the research of humour. He has collaborated with the linguists Raskin and Attardo on their General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) classification system. Their goal is to empirically test both the six autonomous classification types (KRs) and the hierarchical ordering of these KRs. Advancement in this direction would be a win-win for both fields of study; linguistics would have empirical verification of this multi-dimensional classification system for jokes, and psychology would have a standardised joke classification with which they could develop verifiably comparable measurement tools.

=== Linguistics ===
"The linguistics of humor has made gigantic strides forward in the last decade and a half and replaced the psychology of humor as the most advanced theoretical approach to the study of this important and universal human faculty."{{sfn|Raskin|1992|p=91}} This recent statement by one noted linguist and humour researcher describes, from his perspective, contemporary linguistic humour research. [[Linguistics|Linguists]] study words, how words are strung together to build sentences, how sentences create meaning which can be communicated from one individual to another, how our interaction with each other using words creates [[Discourse Analysis|discourse]]. Jokes have been defined above as oral narrative in which words and sentences are engineered to build toward a punchline. The linguist's question is: what exactly makes the punchline funny? This question focuses on how the words used in the punchline create humour, in contrast to the psychologist's concern (see above) with the audience response to the punchline. The assessment of humour by psychologists "is made from the individual's perspective; e.g. the phenomenon associated with responding to or creating humor and not a description of humor itself."{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=19}} Linguistics, on the other hand, endeavours to provide a precise description of what makes a text funny.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=25}}

Two major new linguistic theories have been developed and tested within the last decades. The first was advanced by Victor Raskin in "Semantic Mechanisms of Humor", published 1985.{{sfn|Raskin|1985}} While being a variant on the more general concepts of the [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory of humour]], it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. The [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour]] (SSTH) begins by identifying two linguistic conditions which make a text funny. It then goes on to identify the mechanisms involved in creating the punchline. This theory established the semantic/pragmatic foundation of humour as well as the humour competence of speakers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a text to be funny&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Attardo|2001|p=114}}

Several years later the SSTH was incorporated into a more expansive theory of jokes put forth by Raskin and his colleague Salvatore Attardo. In the [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humour]], the SSTH was relabelled as a Logical Mechanism (LM) (referring to the mechanism which connects the different linguistic scripts in the joke) and added to five other independent Knowledge Resources (KR). Together these six KRs could now function as a multi-dimensional descriptive label for any piece of humorous text.

Linguistics has developed further methodological tools which can be applied to jokes: [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]] of joking. Both of these subspecialties within the field focus on "naturally occurring" language use, i.e. the analysis of real (usually recorded) conversations. One of these studies has already been discussed above, where Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke.{{sfn|Sacks|1974}} Discourse analysis emphasises the entire context of social joking, the social interaction which cradles the words.

=== Folklore and anthropology ===
[[Folklore]] and [[cultural anthropology]] have perhaps the strongest claims on jokes as belonging to their bailiwick. Jokes remain one of the few remaining forms of traditional folk literature transmitted orally in western cultures. Identified as one of the "simple forms" of oral literature by {{Interlanguage link multi|André Jolles|de|3=Johannes Andreas Jolles}} in 1930,{{sfn|Jolles|1930}} they have been collected and studied since there were folklorists and anthropologists abroad in the lands. As a genre they were important enough at the beginning of the 20th century to be included under their own heading in the Aarne–Thompson index first published in 1910: [[Aarne–Thompson classification system#Anecdotes and jokes|Anecdotes and jokes]].

Beginning in the 1960s, cultural researchers began to expand their role from collectors and archivists of "folk ideas"{{sfn|Dundes|1972}} to a more active role of interpreters of cultural artefacts. One of the foremost scholars active during this transitional time was the folklorist Alan Dundes. He started asking questions of tradition and transmission with the key observation that "No piece of folklore continues to be transmitted unless it means something, even if neither the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be."{{sfn|Dundes|Pagter|1987| p=vii}} In the context of jokes, this then becomes the basis for further research. Why is the joke told right now? Only in this expanded perspective is an understanding of its meaning to the participants possible.

This questioning resulted in a blossoming of monographs to explore the significance of many joke cycles. What is so funny about absurd nonsense elephant jokes? Why make light of dead babies? In an article on contemporary German jokes about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Dundes justifies this research:  "Whether one finds Auschwitz jokes funny or not is not an issue. This material exists and should be recorded. Jokes are always an important barometer of the attitudes of a group. The jokes exist and they obviously must fill some psychic need for those individuals who tell them and those who listen to them."{{sfn|Dundes|Hauschild|1983|p=250}} A stimulating generation of new humour theories flourishes like mushrooms in the undergrowth: [[Elliott Oring]]'s theoretical discussions on "appropriate ambiguity" and Amy Carrell's hypothesis of an "audience-based theory of verbal humor (1993)" to name just a few.

In his book ''Humor and Laughter: An Anthropological Approach'',{{sfn|Apte|1985}} the anthropologist Mahadev Apte presents a solid case for his own academic perspective.{{sfn|Apte|2002}} "Two axioms underlie my discussion, namely, that humor is by and large culture based and that humor can be a major conceptual and methodological tool for gaining insights into cultural systems." Apte goes on to call for legitimising the field of humour research as "humorology"; this would be a field of study incorporating an interdisciplinary character of humour studies.{{sfn|Apte|1988}}

While the label "humorology" has yet to become a household word, great strides are being made in the international recognition of this interdisciplinary field of research. The International Society for Humor Studies was founded in 1989 with the stated purpose to "promote, stimulate and encourage the interdisciplinary study of humour; to support and cooperate with local, national, and international organizations having similar purposes; to organize and arrange meetings; and to issue and encourage publications concerning the purpose of the society." It also publishes ''[[Humor: International Journal of Humor Research]]'' and holds yearly conferences to promote and inform its speciality.

=== Computational humour ===
[[Computational humor|Computational humour]] is a new field of study which uses computers to model humour;{{sfn|Mulder|Nijholt|2002}} it bridges the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a joke. Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.

More sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|SSTH]] / [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|GTVH]] humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a "large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker".{{sfn|Raskin|1985|p=46}} These scripts extend much further than the [[lexical definition]] of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.

Further development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an [[Semantic network|ontological semantic]] natural language processing system. It is only "the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well".{{sfn|Raskin|2008|page=17/349}} Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway.{{sfn|Hempelmann|Samson|2008|p=354}} As this field grows in both understanding and methodology, it provides an ideal testbed for humour theories; the rules must firstly be cleanly defined in order to write a computer program around a theory.

=== Physiology of laughter ===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of sixty-year-old man, balding, with white hair and long white bushy beard, with heavy eyebrows shading his eyes looking thoughtfully into the distance, wearing a wide lapelled jacket.|Charles Darwin in his later years.]]
In 1872, [[Charles Darwin]] published one of the first "comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture" (Laughter).{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=24}} In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrates the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of [[gelotology]] (from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|gelos}}'', meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of [[laughter]] and its effects on the body from both a [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laugher, humour being just one of them. The other six causes of laughter listed are: social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling.{{sfnm |1a1=Giles |1a2=Oxford |1y=1970 |2a1=Attardo |2y=2008 |2pp=116–117}} As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.

'''Joke chess problems''' are puzzles in [[chess]] that use [[humor]] as a primary or secondary element. Although most chess problems, like other creative forms, are appreciated for serious artistic themes ([[Grimshaw (chess)|Grimshaw]], [[Novotny (chess)|Novotny]], and [[Lacny]]), joke chess problems are enjoyed for some twist. In some cases the composer plays a trick to prevent a solver from succeeding with typical analysis. In other cases, the humor derives from an unusual final position. Unlike in ordinary [[chess puzzle]]s, joke problems can involve a solution which violates the inner logic or rules of the game.

==Self-solving problems==

| White to move, mate in 6. Can it be stopped?
}}
Some chess puzzles are not really puzzles at all. In the diagram, White is asked to [[checkmate]] Black in six moves. The joke in this case is that, by the rules of chess, White has no choice in the matter: the only legal moves available lead directly to the "solution":
:'''1. d4 b5 2. d5 b4 3. axb4 a3 4. b5 a2 5. b6 a1=any 6. b7{{chessAN|#}}'''

[[Tim Krabbé]] provides other examples on his chess website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_14.htm Examples] &amp;ndash; see items 276, 267, and 265&lt;/ref&gt;

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|Mate in 1
}}
The [[rules of chess]] are fairly simple and clearly defined. Nevertheless, some composers have relied on ambiguities in the rules to create humorous puzzles. A typical example would be the position shown in the diagram on the right. According to chess legend, a composer stipulated "White mates in one move." It appears to be impossible, and now is, but formerly the color of the promoted piece was not specified, and the "solution" was for White to promote to a ''black'' knight on b8, thus depriving the black [[king (chess)|king]] of its only [[flight square|escape square]].

|Mate in 3
}}
A more sophisticated example was composed by [[Tim Krabbé]] and relied on a loophole that existed in the definition of [[castling]]. In the diagram, White must mate in three moves. The solution begins '''1. e7''', then the main variations are:

{{unordered list|style=list-style-position:inside
|'''1... Kd3 2. e8{{=}}Q gxf3''' (other moves allow Qe2#) '''3. 0-0-0#'''
|'''1... Kxf3 2. e8{{=}}R{{chesspunc|!}}''' (an [[underpromotion]]), and now: 
||'''2... d4 3. 0-0#'''
||'''2... Kg2 3. 0-0-0-0#!'''
}}

In the last variation, White castles with his newly promoted [[rook (chess)|rook]], moving his king to e3 and the rook to e2. Under the rules of chess at the time, this move was arguably legal because the rook had not moved yet. Afterward, FIDE amended the rules to require that the castling rook must occupy the same ''rank'' as the king.

==Unusual piece placement or movement==

Some problems are notable for extremely unusual patterns of piece placement. For example, direct mates and especially [[helpmate]]s have been composed with the pieces in the shape of a letter or number, or even a tree.

===The "back home task"===
{{Chess diagram

| Selfmate in 8
}}
A more interesting example occurs in this 1st Prize winner by Kirtley, where the final position echoes a familiar pattern. Krabbé calls this problem the "back home task", as all eight white pieces retreat to their initial positions. He writes that "Strategy and deep themes are absent, Black only has forced moves, but it's one of the funniest chess problems I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_15.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 289&lt;/ref&gt; White must [[selfmate]] in eight moves; i.e., he must force Black to checkmate White against Black's will. The solution is:
:{{pad|1.5em}}'''1. Nb1+ Kb3 2. Qd1+ Rc2 3. Bc1 axb6 4. Ra1 b5 5. Rh1 bxc4 6. Ke1 c3 7. Ng1 f3 8. Bf1 f2#'''

| Mate in 6
}}
Krabbé named the "caterpillar theme" for problems and studies where doubled or tripled pawns move one after the other. The diagram at the right shows a particularly silly example, with White forcing mate in six moves. The solution is:
:'''1. Bb1 b2 2. Ra2 b3 3. Ra3 b4 4. Ra4 b5 5. Ra5 b6 6. Be4#

Krabbé wrote a whole article on the caterpillar theme, citing about ten examples.&lt;ref&gt;The article is not available via direct link, but it can be downloaded on the archives at http://www.chesscafe.com/ (krabbe08.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American composer William A. Shinkman (1847–1933) is famous for composing the problem in the diagram, with sextupled pawns on the a-file.  As Krabbé writes on his website, "The solution, as it should be in a joke, is not difficult: '''1. 0-0-0 Kxa7 2. Rd8 Kxa6 3. Rd7 Kxa5 4. Rd6 Kxa4 5. Rd5 Kxa3 6. Rd4 Kxa2 7. Rd3 Ka1 8. Ra3#'''".&lt;ref name="kuwait-immortal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/kuwait.htm |title=The Kuwait Immortal |publisher=Xs4all.nl |accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem is "{{chessgloss|cook|cooked}}" (ruined, in the lingo of chess composition), however, because 1.Kd2 also forces mate in eight moves. But this problem was not intended to be a sound mate in eight, and was instead intended to be a [[proof game]] in 34 moves with seven consecutive captures by Black.&lt;ref name="kuwait-immortal"/&gt;

==Humour in more traditional chess problems==
Humour is a component of some traditional themes, such as [[grotesque (chess)|grotesque]] and [[Excelsior (chess problem)|Excelsior]].

In 2004, Hans Böhm sponsored a chess composing tournament for humorous [[endgame study|endgame studies]]. The top two entries appear with solutions on Krabbé's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_15.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_14.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-chess chess problems==

In this kind of problem, although the problem is posed as a standard chess problem, the solution has nothing to do with chess moves. An example is this problem composed by British composer [[Thomas Rayner Dawson]]. In the position in the diagram, Black had decided to resign (although it wasn't his turn). White advised his opponent not to give up so quickly. "But I am bound to lose, and there is nothing I—or you, for that matter—can do", said Black. But White insisted: "I'll bet you $100 that I can lose this game!" So the two made the bet and White actually lost. He did not resign, lose on time, or anything like that. How did he lose?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/chessbase-chrismas-puzzles-2014-solutions-2|title=ChessBase Chrismas Puzzles 2014 – solutions|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution is in the words: White did not lose the game (which is impossible in the diagram position, as the only legal moves are 1.g7+ Qxg7+ 2.hxg7#), but rather the bet.

'''Magic''', along with its subgenres of, and sometimes referred to as '''illusion''', '''stage magic''' or '''close up magic''' is a [[performing art]] in which audiences are [[entertainment|entertained]] by staged tricks or [[illusion]]s of seemingly impossible feats using natural means.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Elise (3 May 2016).

It is one of the oldest [[performing arts]] in the world.

Modern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], has become a popular theatrical art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure|type=H.Res|number=642|date=March 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/642/text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne]] and [[David Devant|Devant]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Harry Kellar]], and [[Harry Houdini]] achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as "The Golden Age of Magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinmeyer|first=Jim|title=Hiding the Elephant|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, performance magic became a staple of [[Broadway theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]s. Magic retained its popularity in the [[Television|television age]], with magicians such as [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and [[David Blaine]] transitioning away from traditional venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Colin|date=2002|title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre|publisher=Continuum|page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "magic" etymologically derives from the Greek word ''mageia'' (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika''—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.
Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=THE ART OF DECEPTION or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[money]] games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and [[cult]]s from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Magic tricks===
{{See also|List of magic tricks}}
Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then "restore" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.

[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the "Decollation of John Baptist" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]
One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their "magic tricks" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were [[sleight-of-hand]] manipulations with rope, paper and coins.  At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians – Andi Gladwin&amp;nbsp;– Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209–213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).

[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]
Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]]. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, [[Isaac Fawkes]], who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:
{{quote|He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Christopher | first = Milbourne | title = Magic: A Picture History | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1991| location=New York|isbn=0-486-26373-8|page=16| origyear=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1756 to 1781, [[Jacob Philadelphia]] performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].

===Modern stage magic===
[[File:roberthoudin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], pioneer of modern magic entertainment]]
A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].

[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.

[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]
Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.
Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].&lt;ref name="Dawes_2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (February 10, 1844&amp;nbsp;– December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great.  Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the "first-family of magic".

The escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].

[[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905  to promote and advance the art of stage magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]] and [[Derren Brown]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].

Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.

==Types of magic performance==
Magic is often described according to various specialities or genres.
[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience]]
*'''[[Stage illusions]]''' are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]
*'''[[Parlor magic]]'''  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." Also, many magicians consider the term "parlor" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be "platform", "club" or "cabaret". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. 
*'''[[Micromagic]]''' (also known as '''close-up magic''' or '''table magic''') is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called "table magic", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.
*'''[[Escapology]]''' is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.
*'''[[Pickpocket]]''' magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].
*'''[[Mentalism]]''' creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].
*'''[[Theatrical séances]]''' simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.
*'''[[Children's magic]]''' is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.
*'''Online magic tricks''' were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]]''' is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].
*'''Corporate magic''' or '''trade show magic''' uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock&lt;ref name="Herz1991"&gt;Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive''(New York, NY: Avon Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guy Bavli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli – Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Gospel magic]]''' uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. Don Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.
*'''[[Street magic]]''' is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term "street magic" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].
*'''[[Bizarre magic]]''' uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the "godfather of bizarre magic". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.
*'''Shock magic''' is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as "geek magic", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,
*'''Comedy magic''' is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn &amp; Teller]].
*'''Quick change magic''' is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos &amp; Victoria Petrosyan.
*'''Camera magic''' (or "video magic") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.
*'''Classical Magic''' is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.

==Categories of effects==
Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider "penetrations" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Guy. "Waiting For Inspiration." Genii Magazine. January 2008 – December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Tom. "Lodestones." Genii Magazine. February 2009 -&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.

*'''Production''': The magician produces something from nothing—a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage—all of these effects are ''productions''.
*'''Vanish''': The magician makes something disappear—a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.
*'''Transformation''': The magician transforms something from one state into another—a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]
*'''Restoration''': The magician destroys an object—a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces—then restores it to its original state.
*'''Transposition''': This is whereby two or more objects are used in play. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. 
*'''Transportation''': The magician causes something to move from one place to another—a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.
*'''Escape''':  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.
*'''[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]''': The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few inches off the floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], and [[King levitation]]. The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and more recently by [[Peter Marvey]].  [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.
*'''Penetration''': The magician makes a solid object pass through another—a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as "solid-through-solid".
*'''Prediction''': The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event—a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate—under seemingly impossible circumstances.

Many magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in "[[cups and balls]]" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.

The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.

==Learning magic==

The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.

From the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.

Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.

The world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davenportsmagic.co.uk] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; in London's [[Strand, London|The Strand]] is the world's oldest family-run magic shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-magic-shop] The [[Guinness World Records]], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood]], California, is home to the [[Academy of Magical Arts]].

Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. 
[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.

==Misuse of magic==

Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term "magician" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of "illusionist" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an "honest liar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.

Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.

Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[séance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;  Magician [[James Randi]], magic duo [[Penn and Teller|Penn &amp; Teller]], and the mentalist [[Derren Brown]] have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |work=SWIFT Newsletter |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ One-Million-Dollar Challenge] from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent [[faith healers]] have also been shown to employ [[sleight of hand]] to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet "tumors" from patients' abdomens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Skeptic's Dictionary |url= http://skepdic.com/psurgery.html |title= Psychic 'surgery' |author= Robert T. Carroll |date= 2009-02-23 |accessdate= 2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidence trick|Con men]] and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as "Find the Lady" or "[[Three-card Monte]]" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankenstein. "8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation," [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researching magic==

Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Magic &amp; magicians http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic&lt;/ref&gt; Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magicol.magicana.com/ |title=Magic Collectors |publisher=Magicana |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the [[Conjuring Arts Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conjuringarts.org/ |title=conjuringarts.org |publisher=conjuringarts.org |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.

Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=83646&amp;sid=620815#1981235 |title=Magicians – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the time.

Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author&lt;ref&gt;Bart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.

Several notable public research collections on magic are the ''WG Alma Conjuring Collection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic |title=Get started – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the State Library of Victoria; the ''R.

The '''mass media''' is a diversified collection of [[media (communication)|media]] [[technology|technologies]] that reach a large audience via [[mass communication]]. The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets.

[[Broadcast media]] transmit information electronically, via such media as [[film]], [[radio]], recorded music, or [[television]]. [[Digital media]] comprises both [[Internet]] and [[mobile web|mobile]] mass communication. [[Internet]] media comprise such services as [[email]], [[social media]] sites, [[website]]s, and Internet-based radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, or distributing [[QR Code]]s in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. '''Outdoor media''' transmit information via such media as [[Augmented Reality|AR advertising]]; [[billboard]]s; [[blimp]]s; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or [[skywriting]].&lt;ref name="Mass Media"/&gt;  '''Print media''' transmit information via physical objects, such as [[book]]s, [[comics]], [[magazine]]s, [[newspaper]]s, or [[pamphlet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Riesman ''et al.'' (1950) ch. 2 p. 50{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; Event organizing and [[public speaking]] can also be considered forms of mass media.&lt;ref name="buzzle" /&gt;

The organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arguing for a general framework for mass media scholarship"/&gt;{{qn|date=September 2012}}

== Issues with definition ==

In the late 20th century, mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries: books, the Internet, magazines, movies, newspapers, radio, recordings, and television.  The explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries made prominent the question: what forms of media should be classified as "mass media"?  For example, it is controversial whether to include [[cell phones]], [[computer games]] (such as [[MMORPG]]s), and [[video games]] in the definition.  In the 2000s, a classification called the "[[seven mass media]]" became popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In order of introduction, they are:

# [[Printing|Print]] ([[book]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, etc.) from the late 15th century
# [[Sound recording and reproduction|Recordings]] ([[gramophone record]]s, [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[Stereo-Pak|cartridges]], [[CD]]s, and [[DVD]]s) from the late 19th century
# [[Film|Cinema]] from about 1900
# [[Radio broadcasting|Radio]] from about 1910
# [[Television]] from about 1950
# [[Internet]] from about 1990
# [[Mobile phone]]s from about 2000

Each mass medium has its own content types, creative artists, technicians, and business models.  For example, the Internet includes [[blog]]s, [[podcasts]], [[web site]]s, and various other technologies built atop the general distribution network.  The sixth and seventh media, Internet and mobile phones, are often referred to collectively as [[digital media]]; and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as [[broadcast media]].  Some argue that [[video games]] have developed into a distinct mass form of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541164 |title=All the world's a game |journal=The Economist |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a telephone is a two-way communication device, mass media communicates to a large group. In addition, the telephone has transformed into a cell phone which is equipped with [[Internet]] access. A question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium (the Internet). There is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites, and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones, unsolicited by the phone's user.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} This transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is another form of mass communication.

Video games may also be evolving into a mass medium. Video games (for example massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such as ''[[RuneScape]]'') provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe and convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users. Users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online. Excluding the Internet however,  it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game individually. It is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend one has never played with, because the experience is identical to each. The question, then, is whether this is a form of mass communication.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Characteristics ===

Five characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] of [[Cambridge University]]:&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iXHzjIwQae4C |title=The Media and Modernity|pages=26–28, 74|isbn= 978-0804726795 |year= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[C]omprises both technical and institutional methods of production and distribution" – This is evident throughout the history of mass media, from print to the Internet, each suitable for commercial utility
* Involves the "[[commodification]] of symbolic forms" – as the production of materials relies on its ability to manufacture and sell large quantities of the work; as radio stations rely on their time sold to advertisements, so too newspapers rely on their space for the same reasons
* "[S]eparate contexts between the production and reception of information"
* Its "reach to those 'far removed' in time and space, in comparison to the producers"
* "[I]nformation distribution" – a "one to many" form of communication, whereby products are mass-produced and disseminated to a great quantity of audiences

=== Mass vs. mainstream and alternative ===

The term "mass media" is sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for "'''[[mainstream media]]'''". Mainstream media are distinguished from [[alternative media]] by their content and point of view.  '''Alternative media''' are also "mass media" outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people, even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream.

In common usage, the term "mass" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;

=== Mass vs. local and speciality ===

Mass media are distinguished from '''local media''' by the notion that whilst mass media aims to reach a very large market, such as the entire population of a country, local media broadcasts to a much smaller population and area, and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events. A third type of media, '''speciality media''', provide for specific demographics, such as [[specialty channel]]s on TV ([[sports channel]]s, porn channels, etc.). These definitions are not set in stone, and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet. Some local media, which take an interest in state or provincial news, can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism, and to the local region's preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news. ''[[The Guardian]]'', formerly known as the ''Manchester Guardian'', is an example of one such media outlet; once a regional daily newspaper, ''The Guardian'' is currently a nationally respected paper.&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

== Forms of mass media ==

=== Broadcast ===
[[File:Crystal radio advertisement.png|thumb|A family listening to a [[crystal radio]] in the 1920s.]]
{{Main|Radio broadcasting|Television}}
The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]]. With all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed. Please see the [[list of broadcasting terms]] for a glossary of terms used.

[[Radio]] and [[television]] programs are distributed over frequency bands that in the United States are highly regulated. Such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands, range, licensing, types of receivers and transmitters used, and acceptable content.

[[Cable television]] programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs, but have a more limited audience. By coding signals and requiring a [[cable converter box]] at individual recipients' locations, cable also enables [[subscription]]-based channels and [[pay-per-view]] services.

A broadcasting [[organisation]] may broadcast several programs simultaneously, through several channels ([[frequencies]]), for example [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two|Two]]. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day, such as the [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Adult Swim]]. [[Digital radio]] and [[digital television]] may also transmit [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] programming, with several channels [[data compression|compressed]] into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]].

When broadcasting is done via the Internet the term [[webcasting]] is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce [[podcast]]ing. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. [[Adam Curry]] and his associates, the ''[[Podshow]]'', are principal proponents of podcasting.

=== Film ===
{{Main|Film}}
The term ''''film'''' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]), historically the primary [[recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.  Many other terms for film exist, such as ''motion pictures'' (or just ''pictures'' and "picture"), ''the silver screen'', ''photoplays'', ''the cinema'', ''picture shows'', ''flicks'', and most common, ''movies''.

Films are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] people and objects with [[camera]]s, or by creating them using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, an illusion of motion is created.  Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed.  Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion: a psychological effect identified as [[beta movement]].

Film is considered by many{{who|date=March 2015}} to be an important [[art]] form; films entertain, educate, enlighten, and inspire audiences. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that translate the film message. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.{{who|date=March 2015}}

=== Video games ===

A [[video game]] is a [[computer]]-controlled game in which a video display, such as a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[television]], is the primary feedback device. The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text (and which can, therefore, theoretically be played on a [[teletypewriter]]) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories.{{who|date=March 2015}} There always must also be some sort of [[input device]], usually in the form of [[button (control)|button/joystick]] combinations (on arcade games), a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]]/[[trackball]] combination (computer games), a [[Game controller|controller]] ([[Video game console|console]] games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input, e.g., the player's motion. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.

In common usage, an "[[arcade game]]" refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis. A "computer game" or "[[personal computer game|PC game]]" refers to a game that is played on a [[personal computer]]. A "[[Console game]]" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard [[television]] set. A "video game" (or "videogame") has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, advanced [[calculator]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], etc.

=== Audio recording and reproduction ===

[[Sound recording and reproduction]] is the [[electric]]al or mechanical re-creation or amplification of [[sound]], often as [[music]]. This involves the use of [[audio equipment]] such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the invention of the [[phonograph]] using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the [[Gramophone record|78 record]], the [[wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]] followed by the [[tape recorder]], the vinyl [[Gramophone record|LP record]]. The invention of the [[compact cassette]] in the 1960s, followed by Sony's [[Walkman]], gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of [[digital recording]] and the [[compact disc]] in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality. The most recent developments have been in [[digital audio player]]s.

An album is a collection of related audio recordings, released together to the public, usually commercially.

The term [[album|record album]] originated from the fact that 78 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] [[Phonograph]] [[Gramophone record|disc records]] were kept together in a book resembling a photo album. The first collection of records to be called an "album" was [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'', release in April 1909 as a four-disc set by [[Odeon records]].&lt;ref name="sandiego"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronomedia"/&gt; It retailed for 16 [[shillings]] – about [[Pound sterling|£]]15 in modern currency.

A [[music video]] (also promo) is a [[short film]] or [[video]] that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a [[song]]. Modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the 1980s, when [[Music Television]]'s format was based on them. In the 1980s, the term "rock video" was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.

Music videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including [[animation]], [[live action]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]], and non-narrative, [[abstract film]].

=== Internet ===
{{see also|Digital media}}

The [[Internet]] (also known simply as "the Net" or less precisely as "the Web") is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as "a network of networks". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected [[computer network]]s that transmit [[data (computing)|data]] by [[packet switching]] using the standard [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various [[information]] and services, such as [[email]], [[online chat]], [[Computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

Contrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected ''computer networks'', linked by [[copper]] wires, [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cables, [[wireless]] connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected ''documents'', linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, [[file sharing]] and others described below.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a [[web site]] has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of [[web traffic]] is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of [[peer-to-peer]] technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable.  Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. "content") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes.  This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.

"Cross-media" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as "convergence". Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both [[printing|print]] and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of [[wireless]] devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective "create once, publish many".

The Internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media. Everything is becoming accessible via the internet. Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it. For example, many workers listen to the radio through the Internet while sitting at their desk.

Even the [[education system]] relies on the Internet. Teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail. They may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments. Some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly, with students graded on their contributions.

==== Blogs (web logs) ====

[[Blogging]], too, has become a pervasive form of media.  A [[blog]] is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. [[Microblogging]] is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.

==== RSS feeds ====

[[RSS]] is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like [[Wired News|Wired]], news-oriented community sites like [[Slashdot]], and personal blogs. It is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a "feed" or "web feed" or "channel") contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays.

==== Podcast ====
{{Main|Podcast}}

A [[podcast]] is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers. The term podcast, like broadcast, can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.

==== Mobile ====
{{Main|Mobile media}}

[[Mobile phone]]s were introduced in [[Japan]] in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and other portable devices, and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing tones, ringback tones, truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services. In Japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books.

Similar to the internet, mobile is also an [[interactive media]], but has far wider reach, with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users (source ITU). Like email on the internet, the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service, but SMS text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people. Practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile, from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs. Mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either TV or the internet, starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected. Mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user without any credit cards or PayPal accounts or even an age limit. Mobile is often called the [[Seven mass media|7th Mass Medium]] and either the fourth screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens) or the third screen (counting only TV and PC).

=== Print media ===
{{Main|Newspaper|Magazine}}
{{see also|Publishing#Industry sub-divisions|Printing}}

==== Magazine ====
A [[magazine]] is a periodical [[publication]] containing a variety of articles, generally financed by [[advertising]] or purchase by readers.

Magazines are typically published [[week]]ly, [[biweekly]], [[month]]ly, [[bimonthly]] or [[quarterly]], with a [[periodical cover date|date on the cover]] that is in advance of the date it is actually published.  They are often printed in color on [[coated paper]], and are bound with a [[bookbinding|soft cover]].

Magazines fall into two broad categories: consumer magazines and business magazines.  In practice, magazines are a subset of [[:Category:Periodicals|periodicals]], distinct from those periodicals produced by scientific, artistic, academic or special interest publishers which are subscription-only, more expensive, narrowly limited in circulation, and often have little or no advertising.

Magazines can be classified as:
* General interest magazines (e.g. ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', ''[[India Today]]'', ''[[The Week]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' etc.)
* Special interest magazines (women's, sports, business, [[scuba diving]], etc.)

==== Newspaper ====
A [[newspaper]] is a [[publication]] containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called [[newsprint]]. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly. The most important function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|last=Pavlik, John|first=McIntosh, Shawn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0190271510|location=New York|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local newspapers inform local communities and include advertisements from local businesses and services, while national newspapers tend to focus on a theme, which can be exampled with "The Wall Street Journal" as they offer news on finance and business related-topics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television. Recent developments on the Internet are posing major threats to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper's income, is shifting from print to online; some commentators, nevertheless, point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing.

The internet has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 201/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B0BC365_3_169&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Trends Report]], between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]], where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Most notably, between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outdoor media ===

Outdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards placed inside and outside commercial buildings/objects like shops/buses, flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, skywriting, AR Advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums. Tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively. However, in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement between the US and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes. In a 1994 Chicago-based study, Diana Hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods. In other urban centers, alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in African-American neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Mass Media"/&gt;

== Purposes ==
[[File:911-Panel.JPG|thumb|A panel in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], shows the September 12 headlines in America and around the world.]]

Mass media encompasses much more than just news, although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way.  It can be used for various purposes:
* [[Advocacy]], both for business and social concerns. This can include [[advertising]], [[marketing]], [[propaganda]], [[public relations]], and [[politics|political]] communication.
* [[Entertainment]], traditionally through performances of [[acting]], [[music]], and [[TV show]]s along with light reading; since the late 20th century also through [[video and computer games]].
* [[Public service announcement]]s and emergency alerts (that can be used as political device to communicate propaganda to the public).&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

== Professions involving mass media ==

=== Journalism ===

[[Journalism]] is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting [[information]] regarding [[News|current events]], [[Fads and trends|trends]], issues and [[people]]. Those who practice journalism are known as [[journalist]]s.

[[News]]-oriented journalism is sometimes described as the "first rough draft of history" (attributed to [[Phil Graham]]), because journalists often record important events, producing news articles on short deadlines. While under pressure to be first with their stories, [[news media]] organizations usually [[editing|edit]] and [[proofreading|proofread]] their reports prior to publication, adhering to each organization's standards of accuracy, quality and style. Many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public, while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of [[Journalism#Professional journalism|professional journalism]].

=== Public relations ===

[[Public relations]] is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics to build, manage and sustain its positive image. Examples include:
* [[Corporation]]s use marketing public relations to convey information about the products they manufacture or services they provide to potential customers to support their direct sales efforts.  Typically, they support sales in the short and long term, establishing and burnishing the corporation's branding for a strong, ongoing market.
* Corporations also use public relations as a vehicle to reach legislators and other politicians, seeking favorable tax, regulatory, and other treatment, and they may use public relations to portray themselves as enlightened employers, in support of human-resources recruiting programs.
* [[Non-profit organization|Nonprofit organizations]], including schools and universities, hospitals, and human and social service agencies, use public relations in support of awareness programs, fund-raising programs, staff recruiting, and to increase patronage of their services.
* Politicians use public relations to attract votes and raise money, and when successful at the ballot box, to promote and defend their service in office, with an eye to the next election or, at career’s end, to their legacy.

=== Publishing ===

[[Publishing]] is the industry concerned with the production of [[literature]] or [[information]] – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers.

Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as [[book]]s and [[newspaper]]s. With the advent of digital information systems and the [[Internet]], the scope of publishing has expanded to include [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and the like.

As a [[business]], publishing includes the development, [[marketing]], [[Mass production|production]], and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of newspapers, magazines, books, [[literary work]]s, [[musical composition|musical works]], [[software]], other works dealing with information.

Publication is also important as a [[law|legal concept]]; (1) as the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or enter bankruptcy, and; (2) as the essential precondition of being able to claim [[defamation]]; that is, the alleged [[libel]] must have been published.

==== Software publishing ====

A [[software publisher]] is a [[publishing]] [[company (law)|company]] in the [[software industry]] between the [[software developer|developer]] and the [[distribution (business)|distributor]]. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of [[shareware]]).

Software publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.

Developers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets, or to avoid focussing on marketing. Or publishers may use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.

=== Internet Based Professions ===
A [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] is anyone who has made their fame from creating and promoting videos on the public video-sharing site, [[YouTube]]. Many YouTube celebrities have made a profession from their site through sponsorships, advertisements, product placement, and network support.

== History ==
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Early wooden printing press, depicted in 1520.]]
The history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures. This was the first time when a form of media was "broadcast" to a wider audience. The first dated printed book known is the "[[Diamond Sutra]]", printed in China in 868&amp;nbsp;AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass-medium was probably European [[popular prints]] from about 1400.  Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term "mass media" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation.  He printed the first book, a Latin Bible, on a [[printing press]] with [[movable type]] in 1453. The invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication, by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible.&lt;ref name="Radical mass media criticism: a cultural genealogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramey-2007-1-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex, love &amp; romance in the mass media: analysis &amp; criticism of unrealistic portrayals &amp; their influence"/&gt; The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as [[The Times]], and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of library and information science, Volume 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A companion to media studies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mass media &amp; society"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corey Ross, ''Mass Communications, Society, and Politics from the Empire to the Third Reich'' (Oxford University Press 2010) on Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the media" began to be used in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet"/&gt; The notion of "mass media" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. In recent times, the Internet become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music, and social networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as Google Books. Modern day mass media includes the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.&lt;ref name="History of Mass Media"/&gt;

During the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by [[technology]], including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as [[printing]], record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. [[Radio]] and [[television]] allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil's theory. [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the [[Constituency|electorate]] about issues regarding government and corporate entities (see [[Media influence]]). Some consider the [[concentration of media ownership]] to be a threat to democracy.&lt;ref name="incorporated"/&gt;

=== Mergers and Acquisitions ===
Between 1985 and 2018 about 76,720 deals have been announced in the Media industry. This sums up to an overall value of around 5,634 bil USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries – Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three major waves of M&amp;A in the Mass Media Sector (2000, 2007 and 2015), while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals. The U.S. is the most prominent country in Media M&amp;A with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquiror from the United States.

The largest deal in history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc for 164,746.86 mil USD.

== Influence and sociology ==
{{main|influence of mass media}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
'''Limited-effects theory''', originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s, considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. '''Class-dominant theory''' argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. '''Culturalist theory''', which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s, combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. This theory states that audience members play an active, rather than passive role in relation to mass media.

{{Globalize|section|date=March 2015}}
In an article entitled ''Mass Media Influence on Society'', rayuso {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} argues that the media ''in the US'' is dominated by five major companies (Time Warner, VIACOM, Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp) which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks, movie studios, television and radio broadcast networks and programing, video news, sports entertainment, telecommunications, wireless phones, video games software, electronic media and music companies. Whilst historically, there was more diversity in companies, they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people. People buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in TV, newspapers or magazines, which are able to affect their purchasing decisions. The definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media. This power can be used for good, for example encouraging children to play sport. However, it can also be used for bad, for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars, their exposure to sex images, their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads. The documentary ''[[Super Size Me]]'' describes how companies like McDonald's have been sued in the past, the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that "forced" them to purchase the product. The Barbie and Ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern-day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff. After the attacks of 9/11, the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed Osama Bin Laden's guilt for the attack, information they were told by the authorities. This shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism, and later, the war on Iraq. A main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media (being able to drive the public opinion), media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause.

In his book The Commercialization of American Culture, Matthew P. McAllister says that "a well-developed media system, informing and teaching its citizens, helps democracy move toward its ideal state."&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;

In 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media:

:#'''The Knowledge Gap:''' The mass media influences knowledge gaps due to factors including "the extent to which the content is appealing, the degree to which information channels are accessible and desirable, and the amount of social conflict and diversity there is in a community".
:#'''Agenda Setting:''' People are influence in how they think about issues due to the selective nature of what media choose for public consumption. After publicly disclosing that he had prostate cancer prior to the 2000 New York senatorial election, Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York City (aided by the media) sparked a huge priority elevation of the cancer in people's consciousness. This was because news media began to report on the risks of prostate cancer, which in turn prompted a greater public awareness about the disease and the need for screening. This ability for the media to be able to change how the public thinks and behaves has occurred on other occasions. In mid-1970s when Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller, wives of the then-President and then-Vice President respectively, were both diagnosed with breast cancer. J. J. Davis states that "when risks are highlighted in the media, particularly in great detail, the extent of agenda setting is likely to be based on the degree to which a public sense of outrage and threat is provoked". When wanting to set an agenda, framing can be invaluably useful to a mass media organisation. Framing involves "taking a leadership role in the organisation of public discourse about an issue". The media is influenced by the desire for balance in coverage, and the resulting pressures can come from groups with particular political action and advocacy positions. Finnegan and Viswanath say, "groups, institutions, and advocates compete to identify problems, to move them onto the public agenda, and to define the issues symbolically" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;324).
:#'''Cultivation of Perceptions:''' The extent to which media exposure shapes audience perceptions over time is known as cultivation. Television is a common experience, especially in places like the United States, to the point where it can be described as a "homogenising agent" (S. W. Littlejohn). However, instead of being merely a result of the TV, the effect is often based on socioeconomic factors. Having a prolonged exposure to TV or movie violence might affect a viewer to the extent where they actively think community violence is a problem, or alternatively find it justifiable. The resulting belief is likely to be different depending of where people live however.&lt;ref name="enotes" /&gt;

Since the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population, these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control.&lt;ref name="Lorimer94p26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vipond2000p88"/&gt; Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the country itself "belongs to the person who controls communications."&lt;ref name="Eco67"/&gt;

Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information.&lt;ref name="Lorimer94p26"/&gt; They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation.&lt;ref name="Vipond2000p88"/&gt; Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general strikes.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;Dan Braha. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048596 "Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction"], PLoS ONE 7(10) (2012): e48596. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0048596}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

Mass media sources, through theories like framing and agenda-setting, can affect the scope of a story as particular facts and information are highlighted ([[Media influence]]). This can directly correlate with how individuals may perceive certain groups of people, as the only media coverage a person receives can be very limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation; stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective to target a specific demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Al-Jazeera English and global news networks: Clash of civilizations or cross-cultural dialogue?|last = Powers, S., el-Nawawy, M.|date = 2009|journal = Media, War &amp; Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example ====
According to Stephen Balkaran, an Instructor of Political Science and African American Studies at Central Connecticut State University, mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African-Americans. The media focus on African-American in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African-Americans. African-Americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years. According to Stephen Balkaran in his article "Mass Media and Racism": "The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African-Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens". This has resulted in an uncertainty among white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African-Americans really is. Despite the resulting [[racial segregation|racial divide]], the fact that these people are undeniably American has "raised doubts about the white man's value system". This means that there is a somewhat "troubling suspicion" among some Americans that their white America is tainted by the black influence.&lt;ref name="Mass Media and Racism" /&gt; Mass media as well as [[propaganda]] tend to reinforce or introduce [[stereotype]]s to the general public.

== Ethical issues and criticism ==

Lack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media.  A mass [[news media]] outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers. An example given by the website WiseGeek is that "the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical, but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set".&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

The term "mass" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of "mass culture" and [[mass society]] which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them.&lt;ref name="thompson" /&gt;  However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.&lt;ref name="thompson" /&gt;

Whilst some{{who|date=January 2012}} refer to the mass media as "opiate of the masses", others{{who|date=January 2012}} argue that is a vital aspect of human societies. By understanding mass media, one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of one's population and culture. This valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of [[media studies]] is popular. As WiseGeek says, "watching, reading, and interacting with a nation's mass media can provide clues into how people think, especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused".&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

Since the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.&lt;ref name="Eco67"/&gt;

Contemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of [[concentration of media ownership]], with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms.&lt;ref name="The SAGE Handbook of Media Studies"/&gt;

'''Criticism'''

When the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=G.|title=2015 Henry Mayer Lecture: critical media studies and the re-invention of the media|journal=Media International Australia|language=en|volume=161|issue=1|pages=101–08|doi=10.1177/1329878x16659549|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, there are critiques that mass media no longer exists, or at least that it doesn't exist in the same form as it once did. This original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to "news" something that is harder to do in a society of social media.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/87571696&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production.&lt;ref&gt;file:///Users/jessicafrankson/Downloads/Bennett--The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20News%20and%20the%20End%20of%20a%20Journalism%20Era%20(1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's critique of 21st Century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or wouldn't be printed.

Social Media is a large contributor to the change from mass media to a new paradigm because through social media what is mass communication and what is interpersonal communication is confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zdRzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=mass+media+re+invented#v=onepage&amp;q=mass%20media%20re%20invented&amp;f=false|title=Re-Inventing the Media|last=Turner|first=Graeme|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317381471|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpersonal/niche communication is an exchange of information and information in a specific genre. In this form of communication, smaller groups of people are consuming news/information/opinions. In contrast, mass media in its original form is not restricted by genre and it is being consumed by the masses.

'''''Monsters vs. Aliens''''' is a [[media franchise]] created by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. The franchise began with the 2009 film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' and has since grown to include a short film, two television specials, a television series, and a video game.

The franchise involves a group of monsters who are assigned by the [[US Government]] to defend [[Earth]] from various [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] and [[supernatural]] threats.

==Feature film==
{{main|Monsters vs. Aliens}}
''Monsters vs. Aliens''  is a 2009 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] 3-D [[science fiction]] [[action comedy]] [[film]]. It was DreamWorks Animation's first feature film to be directly produced in a [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3-D format instead of being converted into 3-D after completion, which added $15 million to the film's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Susan |last= Wloszczyna |title=First look: ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' is the ultimate; a 3-D 'first' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-03-10-monsters-aliens_N.htm |work=USA Today|date= March 11, 2008|accessdate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled for a May 2009 release, but the release date was moved to March 27, 2009. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray September 29, 2009, in North America and included the easter egg to the upcoming movies and previews. The film features the voices of [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Conrad Vernon]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Paul Rudd]].

===Possible sequel===
In April 2011, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies, like ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', and ''[[Megamind]]'', saying that these films "all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/04/dreamworks-pins-hopes-on-kung-fu-panda-2-after-first-quarter-earnings-fall-short-125845/|title=DreamWorks Animation Pins Hopes On 'Kung Fu Panda 2' After 1Q Earnings Fall Short|last=Lieberman|first=David|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==

===''B.O.B.'s Big Break''===
''B.O.B.'s Big Break'' is a 3D animated short film. The short premiered on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in 2D on September 26, 2009, and was released 3 days later in 2D and 3D on the ''Monsters vs Aliens'' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and the double DVD pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smash Hit Comedy, MONSTERS VS.

B.O.B., Dr. Cockroach, PhD, and The Missing Link are trying to outwit Captain W.R. Monger to escape from Area 52, the government's top-secret holding cell. Cockroach's escape attempt by feeding B.O.B. a chemical mixture to turn him into a bomb instead results in B.O.B. temporarily acquiring the ability to read minds, and allowing them to find out about a secret exit from Area 52. Unfortunately, the plan fails when B.O.B. smashes the jet they were using to escape believing it to be a [[piñata]], with the resulting explosion erasing B.O.B.'s new power.

Following the cliff hanger at the end of ''Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space'', the mutated carrot has spawned hundreds of zombie carrots which once they bite a victim they take control of the subject's mind. Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat the carrots and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots (specifically because B.O.B. has no brain and thus is immune to the carrots' mind control powers), which B.O.B eventually, albeit reluctantly, does. At the end of the short, B.O.B. is turned into a giant zombie carrot.

Susan and the fellow monsters go back to Susan's home in Modesto, California; just in time for Halloween celebrations. Susan spends time with her parents, while the other monsters join in trick-or-treating and collect a large amount of candy. Later, it is revealed that the monsters came to destroy mutant pumpkins disguised as Jack-o-lanterns. When the pumpkins begin to eat children's candies to grow larger, the monsters and children defeat them by throwing excessive candy to bloat them up and explode them. But, in a [[twist ending]], some of the pumpkin "blood" (a green goo that mutated the ordinary pumpkins) falls into a planting of carrots, causing a mutant carrot to be formed.

[[File:Mystery Play Metz.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a performance of the Mystery Play of [[Clement of Metz|Saint Clement]] in [[Metz]] during the Middle Ages.]]

'''Mystery plays''' and '''miracle plays''' (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably&lt;ref&gt;'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only). Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vernacular Drama | Medieval Drama." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208054447/https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]'' used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''ministerium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the [[craft guilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|author2=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203–204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Mystery play 001.jpg|thumb|Mystery play, [[Flanders]], 15th century]]
As early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.&lt;ref name=bellinger&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/bellinger001.html Bellinger, Martha Fletcher, "A Thousand Years Of Quiescence And The Beginnings Of Sacred Drama", ''A Short History of the Drama'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1927. pp. 115-21]&lt;/ref&gt;
The plays originated as simple ''[[Trope (religion)|tropes]]'', verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.

The ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.&lt;ref name=bellinger/&gt; These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''&lt;!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --&gt; meaning "occupation" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.

==English mystery plays==
[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]
There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]&lt;/ref&gt; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=13&amp;division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&amp;division=div&amp;id=AnoTown&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;part=13&amp;tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is strongly suggestive. In "The London Burial Grounds" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet "Wakefield Master" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &amp;mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.

The best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.

The dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}&lt;/ref&gt; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances. [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], writing in the 19th century, notes that "especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite indeed book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|title=Cyclopaedia of English Literature|publisher=Robert Chambers|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|year=1844|oclc=311881902}}, quoted in {{cite book|last=Clopper|first=Lawrence M.|title=Drama, play, and game: English festive culture in the medieval and early modern period|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|pages=69–70|isbn=978-0-226-11030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornish language]] miracle plays were performed in [[plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|plain-an-gwarrys]]. To capture the attention of the audience, "the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining".&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/a2m/medieval/plain_an_gwarry/st_just/st_just.htm ''St Just Plain-an-Gwarry''.] Historic Cornwall. Retrieved 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101125612/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ |date=1 November 2015 }}, ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Isango Ensemble]] produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe.

The large cast also included [[Daniel MacPherson]], [[Thomas James Longley]] and [[Joseph McManners]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

The '''National Amusement Park Historical Association''' (NAPHA) is an international organization dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of the amusement and [[theme park]] industry – past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napha.org|title=National Amusement Park Historical Association|website=www.napha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NAPHA]] was founded in 1978 by a former employee of Chicago’s [[Riverview Park (Chicago)|Riverview amusement park]] (closed 1967) and has grown through the years to include amusement park enthusiasts from around the world.

==About==

Since its founding in 1978, the National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA) has worked closely with the amusement industry to further its mission of preserving its heritage and traditions.  As the world’s only organization dedicated to all aspects of the amusement industry, the organization fills a unique role.

As part of NAPHA’s mission to preserve the heritage and traditions of amusement parks, the organization tries to work with the industry to protect key components of its history.  NAPHA’s efforts have resulted in the preservation of several historic rides including: 
* The second [[Tilt-A-Whirl]] ever manufactured
* The only Teeter Dip in existence
* One of America's last remaining Venetian Swings rides, now at Crossroads Village, Flint, MI
* A 1936 Smith &amp; Smith Chairplane, which found a new home at [[Bay Beach Amusement Park|Bay Beach Park]] in Green Bay, WI.

But ride preservation goes beyond the restoration of actual rides.  NAPHA has also played an active role in recreating lost classics, providing vintage blueprints that led to the construction of the [[Raging Wolf Bobs]] at [[Geauga Lake]], a modern version of the Bobs at Chicago’s defunct Riverview Park, and most recently, the re-creation of a classic wooden [[Flying Turns]] by [[Knoebels Amusement Resort]] in Pennsylvania.  In addition, NAPHA was the catalyst for the reconstruction of the [[Zippin' Pippin]] wooden coaster at Bay Beach.

Materials for these recreations came from NAPHA’s archives.  Located in a climate controlled storage facility outside Chicago, NAPHA’s holdings are highlighted by the John Caruthers Collection, quite possibly the largest collection of amusement park postcards with over 16,000 items, and Eugene K. Feerer Collection. Feerer was a former president of International Amusement Device. Inc. (IADI) the successor to [[National Amusement Devices]] (NAD).  In addition to a wealth of information on IADI, NAD and [[Dayton Fun House]], the collection contains what is perhaps the largest collection of [[John A. Miller]] materials anywhere including blueprints, photographs and correspondence.

But NAPHA cannot preserve the industry alone and in 1993 it began its Life Membership Award to honor organizations from around the world that demonstrate a "commitment to preserving the heritage and traditions of the amusement park industry."  Since that time the award has been presented to [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool|Pleasure Beach]], Blackpool, UK; [[Kennywood]], West Mifflin, PA; [[Rye Playland|Playland]], Rye, NY and Knoebel’s Amusement Resort.  Each park was singled out for their extensive lineup of well-maintained historic amusement rides.

==Preservation efforts==

To further support its mission of preserving the heritage and tradition of the amusement industry, NAPHA established the Heritage Fund in 1994.  Using funds raised from member and industry donations, memorabilia auctions and other fundraising events, the fund had succeeded in donating nearly $40,000 to organizations working to protect industry history.  Recipients have included industry related museums, groups working to preserve or restore specific historic rides and non-profit operators of amusement parks.

==Annual members survey==

In 1986, NAPHA became first organization to survey its members on a regular basis.  Initially intended to provide feedback to NAPHA’s Executive Committee, it soon became an anxiously awaited listing of favorite parks and attractions by an experienced group of amusement park visitors.  Many parks, including [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg|Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA]], and Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA, use the results in their promotional campaigns.  In Spring 2012, the results of the 26th annual members’ survey were announced.  For the 22nd consecutive year, Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, VA, has been selected as the Most Beautiful Park.

Other 2012 favorites include:

* Favorite Traditional Amusement Park – Kennywood, West Mifflin, PA
* Favorite Theme Park – [[Walt Disney World]], Lake Buena Vista, FL
* Best Park for Families – Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, PA
* Favorite Wood Roller Coaster – [[Phoenix (roller coaster)|Phoenix]], Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, PA
* Favorite Steel Roller Coaster – [[Millennium Force]], [[Cedar Point]], Sandusky, OH
* Best New Attraction – Zippin Pippin, [[Bay Beach Amusement Park]], Green Bay, WI

==Events==
Each summer NAPHA hosts two or three special events, inviting its members from around the world to experience an amusement park in a unique way.  NAPHA visits parks of all shapes and sizes from the largest theme parks to smaller family owned facilities, but whenever possible, focuses its events on amusement parks celebrating major anniversaries.  Since its founding, NAPHA has honored 18 amusement parks that have celebrated their 100th anniversary, including 17 of the 41 in the United States that have hit that milestone.  The organization has also been on hand for three 125th anniversaries, a 90th, three 75th’s, a 50th and a 25th.

Conventions have included tours of amusement parks in Europe, Great Britain and California; Anniversary Celebrations at Cedar Point (Ohio), Kennywood (Pennsylvania), Knoebels Amusement Resort (Pennsylvania), [[Seabreeze Amusement Park|Seabreeze]] (New York), [[Waldameer Park]] (Pennsylvania) and [[Idlewild and Soak Zone]] (Pennsylvania); and weekends visiting amusement parks on the [[Jersey Shore]] and in the New England, Denver, and Minneapolis areas.  Other recent host parks have included Busch Gardens (Virginia), [[Indiana Beach]] (Indiana), [[Kings Island]] (Cincinnati), [[Dollywood]] (Tennessee) and [[Holiday World]] (Indiana).

Conventions typically include an opening party/reception, a picnic lunch, behind the scenes tours, a memorabilia auction and numerous exclusive ride times on the park’s roller coasters and other unique and historic rides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14125">'''New adult''' ('''NA''') '''fiction''', also rendered as '''new-adult fiction''', is a developing genre of fiction with protagonists in the 18–30 age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Sandra L. (2008). Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for "...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'".&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Martin's New Adult Contest|url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/st-martins-new-adult-contest|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Would you read novels aimed at 'new adults'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/10/new-adult-fiction|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=London|first=Briony|last=Chappell|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, [[Colleen Hoover]], and Jamie McGuire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=19 May 2013|first1=Deirdre|last1=Donahue|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Alexander Interview Part 3|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/karl-alexander-interview-part-3|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' Fiction Is Now an Official Literary Genre Because Marketers Want Us to Buy Things|url=http://jezebel.com/5960942/new-adult-fiction-is-now-an-official-literary-genre-because-marketers-want-you-to-buy-things|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for [[HarperCollins]] described it as "a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond Wizards and Vampires, to Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2013|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' ''A Court of Thorns and Roses'' and ''Throne of Glass'', Jennifer L. Armentrout's ''Wait For You'', Jamie McGuire's ''Beautiful Disaster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' books growing up|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20130420/THINGSTODO07/304200030/-New-Adult-books-growing-up|publisher=Lansing State Journal|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Hoover's ''Slammed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587#.UZhSmKLFVqw|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cora Carmack's ''Losing It'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are your teens ready for New Adult fiction?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/17501716-423/are-your-teens-ready-for-new-adult-fiction.html|publisher=Sun Times|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Ryan (novelist)|Kendall Ryan]]'s ''The Impact of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2013/06/09/kendall-ryan-the-impact-of-you-new-adult/|title=Sexy-romance author Kendall Ryan gives New Adult a try|date=2013-06-09|website=Happy Ever After|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
This category is intended to be marketed to [[Adolescence|post-adolescents]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young-adults]] ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative "cross-over" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Sandra L. |title=Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives|pages= 111, 119–126|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/postadolescent-or-new-adult-fiction/ |title=Postadolescent or 'New Adult' Fiction |author= JJ |date=10 November 2009 |work= Publishing, Reviews |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from [[young adult fiction]] are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html |title=Publishing Gives Hints of Revival, Data Show |first=Julie |last=Bosman |date= August 9, 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.

==Themes and issues==
New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.

Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying&lt;ref&gt;[[young adult fiction]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.

This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.

==Genre==
Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. [[Science fiction]], [[urban fiction]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal]], [[dystopia]], etc. are some examples.

==Controversies==

===Publishing industry===
Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingcrawl.com/2013/01/30/new-adult-passing-trend-or-legitimate-genre/|title=New Adult- Passing Trend or Legitimate Genre?|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/ | work=USA Today | first1=Deirdre | last1=Donahue | title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books | date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/29/with-new-digital-imprints-random-house-taps-self-published-authors/|title=With new digital imprints, Random House taps self-published authors|first=Laura|last=Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=paidcontent.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

===Sex===
In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as ''Slammed'' by [[Colleen Hoover]], ''Easy'' by Tamarra Webber, and ''[[Beautiful Disaster (novel)|Beautiful Disaster]]'' by [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]] got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Kaufman | title=Young-Adult Authors Are Creating a Steamy New Genre | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which featured a heroine in college.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut on Top|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=23 February 2013|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/new-adult-its-not-about-the-sex-but-dont-be-afraid-of-the-sex-either/|title=New Adult: It’s not about the sex (but don’t be afraid of the sex either)|date=25 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? - NoveList - EBSCOhost|website=www.ebscohost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 to present==
Following the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing.  Major New York publishers are taking self-published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales.  Some authors include:

*Cora Carmack for ''Losing It''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/self-published-author-signs-a-three-book-deal-heralding-new-adult-fiction/|title=Self-Published Author Signs a Three-Book Deal, Heralding New Adult Fiction|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012|work=The New York Times|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''normal play''' '''convention''' in a game is the method of determining the winner that is generally regarded as standard. For example:
*Preventing the other player from being able to move
*Being the first player to achieve a target
*Holding the highest value hand
*Taking the most [[Trick-taking game|card tricks]]

In [[combinatorial game theory]], the normal play convention of an [[impartial game]] is that the last player able to move is the winner.

By contrast "[[misère game]]s" involve upsetting the convention and declaring a winner the individual who would normally be considered the loser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">The '''Production Manager''' of a band is in charge of the technical crew. The technical crew moves independently of the band because the technical crew must arrive at the gig location by the morning of the show to start setting up the equipment. The band members usually arrive much later, just before the event itself.

==Responsibilities of Production Manager==
As the tour is being planned, the Production Manager must contract for services such as lighting, sound, trucking, rigging, bussing, and catering. The competition is fierce between the companies offering such services. Specific discussions must take place between the Production Manager and the providers clarifying the quality of the equipment, management and crew, as well as the prices bid.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Martin|Martin, George]]: "Making Music: the Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording", pge 214. [[Quill Press]]: [[New York City]] (1983) {{ISBN|0-688-01466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tour manager==
At this point the tour manag, as the technical success of the tour depends on the crew members working together effectively and efficiently.

A '''ring girl''' is a woman who enters the ring between rounds of a [[combat sport]], carrying a sign that displays the number of the upcoming round. Ring girls are often seen in [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]].

==History==
Ring girls first appeared in a 1965 edition of ''[[Ring Magazine]]''. The magazine published a photo of a Las Vegas model holding a sign at a boxing match. Boxing promotions adapted the concept of ring girls at their events.&lt;ref name="livestrong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/422685-what-are-the-girls-who-walk-around-the-boxing-rings-between-rounds/|title=What Are the Girls Who Walk Around the Boxing Rings Between Rounds?|author=Steven Kelliher|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2017|publisher=livestrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional wrestling, ring girls are attendants who remove the entrance gear (such as jackets, robes, and other clothing) and championship belts from the ring after a wrestler takes them off before his match. Throughout the 1980s, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] employed ring girls known as the Federettes. Since its inception in 2002, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] has featured various independent female wrestlers and valets as ring girls.

During the first year of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', WWE featured traditional boxing-style ring girls who carried signs featuring various ''Raw''-themed slogans in the ring between matches.

==Controversies==
===Sexism===
Some sports viewers, medias and fighters claim that ring girls are unnecessary. Ring girls first appeared in boxing, when viewers are mostly men. Having half-naked women at the games provided sexual attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/92032564/boxings-ring-girls-harmless-entertainment-or-dark-ages-sexism|title=Boxing's ring girls: harmless entertainment or Dark Ages sexism?|date=April 28, 2017|author=Kevin Norquay|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We have women as part of the actual athletic competition in MMA," argued sports columnist Ben Fowlkes, "We have a multitude of female fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/03/trading-shots-what-outdated-tradition-should-mma-ditch-once-and-for-all|title=Trading Shots: What outdated tradition should MMA ditch once and for all?|date=March 8, 2015|author=Ben Fowlkes and Danny Downes|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports journalist Malissa Smith called ring girls "blatant sexual exploitation".

In contrast, some people see ring girls as a harmless tradition. Boxing promoter Lisa Elovich calls the practice "part of the show."&lt;ref name="livestrong"/&gt; Neuroscientist Jack Pemment argues that ring girls help grow modeling careers for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/blame-the-amygdala/201307/the-role-ring-girls-professional-fighting-events|title=The Role of Ring Girls at Professional Fighting Events|date=July 4, 2013|author=Jack Pemment|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ring boys" or "ring guys" have been proposed for women's matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1402083-ufc-2012-should-the-ufc-get-rid-of-ring-card-girls|title=In Light of the Ronda Rousey News, Should the UFC Get Rid of Ring Card Girls?|date=November 8, 2012|author=Matt Saccaro|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/mma-say-hello-to-ring-dudes|title=MMA,Say Hello to Ring Dudes|date=October 11, 2013|author=Amy Winters|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-boxer [[Mikaela Laurén]] said "I want a number boy. I think that's only fair, and I'm sure it will give the women in the audience some pleasure as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/boxing-champ-mikaela-lauren-wants-ring-boys-for-her-next-fight|title=Boxing Champ Mikaela Lauren Wants "Ring Boys" for Her Next Fight|date=April 21, 2016|author=Sarah Kurchak|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all-female fighting promotion [[Invicta FC]] utilizes ring girls, the promotion brought in UFC fighter and sometimes model [[Elias Theodoreau]] to serve as a ring boy at Invicta FC 28. In an appearance on [[Ariel Helwani]]'s [[The MMA Hour]], Theodoreau said that "Mixed martial arts has been at the forefront of equality in many different ways. You can see in regards to women being on top of pay-per-views and selling millions and also now myself included as the first ring boy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/2/19/17028530/elias-theodorou-to-act-as-ring-boy-at-invicta-fc-28|title=Elias Theodorou to act as ‘ring boy’ at Invicta FC 28|date=February 19, 2018|author=Alexander K. Lee|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodoreau received criticism, however, for using the occasion to promote sponsors, and for showing less skin than a ring girl traditionally would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2018/03/ufc-ring-boy-elias-theodorou-steal-invicta-spotlight-or-add-shine|title=Trading Shots: Did 'ring boy' Elias Theodorou steal Invicta FC spotlight or add shine?|date=March 25, 2018|author=Ben Fowlkes and Danny Downes|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payments===
There were speculations that ring girls are paid more than some female athletes. In 2015, former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] bamtamweight champion [[Ronda Rousey]] protested. "Do you think her walking in circles, " argued Rousey, "is worth more (than fighters)? ... either the ring card girls are paid too much, or the fighters aren't paid enough." UFC ring girls are reputedly paid $18,000 a year. This excludes jobs outside the UFC, like modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladbible.com/more/viral-sport-this-is-how-much-ufc-ring-card-girls-earn-20170324|title=This Is How Much UFC Ring Card Girls Earn|date=March 24, 2017|author=Mark McGowan|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UFC ring girl [[Arianny Celeste]] protested, calling Rousey a "big bully".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/big-bully-ronda-rousey-in-heated-feud-with-ufc-ring-girl/|title='Big bully' Ronda Rousey in heated feud with UFC ring girl|author=Brian Lewis|date=February 26, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/02/ronda-rousey-responds-to-arianny-celestes-bully-comments-im-sorry-but-im-not-impressed-with-the-job/|title=Rousey on Celeste's 'bully' comments: 'I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed with the job'|author=Brent Brookhouse and John Morgan|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I think people don't realise how much work it is to be a model," argued Celeste, "Trying being like a live mannequin and having clients put you in a million different outfits... It's not as easy as it looks... Not a lot of people would know that unless they were in my shoes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/02/arianny-celeste-on-ufc-champ-ronda-rouseys-criticism-i-see-her-as-a-big-bully|title=Arianny Celeste on UFC champ Ronda Rousey's criticism: 'I see her as a big bully'|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ripley410112.gif|right|thumb|370px|[[Robert Ripley]]'s ''Believe It or Not'' (January 12, 1941)]]
'''''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''''' is an American franchise, founded by [[Robert Ripley]], which deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper [[Panel (comics)|panel]], the ''Believe It or Not'' feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic book]]s, a chain of museums, and a book series.

The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-based [[Ripley Entertainment|Ripley Entertainment, Inc.]], a division of the [[Jim Pattison Group]], is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.

Ripley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, ''Champs and Chumps'', and it premiered on December 19, 1918, in ''[[The New York Globe]]''. Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to ''Believe It or Not''.  When the ''Globe'' folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York Evening Post]]''. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by [[Associated Newspapers (U.S.)|Associated Newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Neal. ''A Curious Man: The Strange &amp; Brilliant Life of Robert "Believe It Or Not!" Ripley'' (Crown/Archetype, 2014), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the ''Globe''). That same year, Ripley hired [[Norbert Pearlroth]] as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Norbert Pearlroth, 89, Researcher For 52 Years For 'Believe It Or Not' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/obituaries/norbert-pearlroth-89-researcher-for-52-years-for-believe-it-or-not.html |quote=Norbert Pearlroth, who combed hundreds of thousands of books in the New York Public Library over 52 years as sole researcher for ''Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' died of heart and kidney diseases Thursday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 89 years old and lived in Brooklyn. ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 15, 1983 |accessdate=2015-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York American]]'' and was picked up by the [[King Features Syndicate]], being quickly syndicated on an international basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''A Curious Man'', pp. 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included [[Paul Frehm]] (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), [[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|Bob Clarke]] (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of ''Believe It or Not!'' for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as did [[Wally Wood]] and [[Ernie Kovacs]], who also did a recurring satire called "Strangely Believe It!" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'', John Hix's ''[[Strange as it Seems]]'', and Gordon Johnston's ''[[It Happened in Canada]]''. The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/ripleysbelieveitornot |title=Ripley's Believe It or Not Comic Strip on |website=Gocomics.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.

''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was "a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mendelson, Lee |title=Charlie Brown &amp; Charlie Schulz |year=1970 |publisher=The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for ''Peanuts''' [[Snoopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles M.|last=Schulz|title=Around the world in 50 years: Charlie Brown's anniversary celebration|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1994|page=11|isbn=978-0-8362-1766-7|authorlink=Charles M.

In 2004 Ripley Entertainment founded [[Ripley Publishing Ltd]], based in the United Kingdom, to publish new ''Believe It or Not'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/ripley-sets-uk.html |title=Ripley sets up in UK |publisher=theBookseller.com |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company produces ''the New York Times'' bestselling ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not Annual|Ripley's Believe It or Not!

The people whose items are featured in such books as [[Ripley's Believe It or Not Annual|''Strikingly True'']], have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. "Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me."&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maynard's Spooky Action...An Interview with Edward Meyer from Ripley's Believe It or Not|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-161-19-nov-2011|website=[[The Skeptic Zone]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated.&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"/&gt;

==Radio==
On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought "Believe It or Not" to [[radio]], the first of several series heard on [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}. Pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by [http://www.otr.com/ripley_on_radio.html Ripley On Radio], Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's ''Saturday Party'', Ripley was the host of ''[[The Baker's Broadcast]]'' from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. ''See America First with Bob Ripley'' (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into ''See All the Americas'', a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on [[World War II]]. ''Romance, Rhythm and Ripley'' aired on CBS in 1945, followed by ''Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook'' (1947–48).

Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from [[Buenos Aires]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matineeclassics.com/radio/1930/ripleys_believe_it_or_not/details/ |title=Old Time Radio Shows - Ripley's Believe It or Not!

As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall cigarettes]] and [[General Foods]]. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to [[television]].

==Films, television, Internet, and computer game==
The newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows.

===Film===

*He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, ''Seasons Greetings'' (1931), with [[Ruth Etting]], [[Joe Penner]], [[Ted Husing]], [[Thelma White]], [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], and others.
* Ripley's short films were parodied in a 1939 [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] titled ''Believe It or Else''. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by [[Tex Avery]] and written by [[Dave Monahan]], it featured a running gag in which [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)#Egghead|Egghead]] (a prototype [[Elmer Fudd]]) appeared to declare, "I don't believe it!"  On 5 November of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, ''Fresh Fish'', was released. Written by [[Jack Miller (writer)|Jack Miller]], this cartoon's running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, "Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?"
*[[20th Century Fox]] produced another [[film short]] titled '''Acquitted By The Sea''', released September 27, 1940, produced by [[Truman Talley]] and directed by [[Earl Allvine]]. This told an unusual story involving the ''[[Titanic]]''.

====Planned film====
On October 4, 2004, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film would be produced by [[James Jacks]] and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, "It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened." Jacks also said, "We want to turn it into an ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', a goofy version, as played by [[Johnny Depp]]. When they saw we had the writers from ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt|Larry Flynt]]'', they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]-type movie with one of their characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=Paramount Telling Ripley Tale: Believe It or Not|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/04/paramount-telling-ripley-tale|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=IGN|date=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2005, it was announced that [[Tim Burton]] would direct the film, with [[Jim Carrey]] starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey May Believe|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/29/burton-carrey-may-believe|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jacks, [[Sean Daniel]] and [[Richard D. Zanuck]] were also to serve as producers for the film.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011/&gt; Zanuck spent six weeks in China to [[Location scouting|scout filming locations]] for the project.&lt;ref name=Borat/&gt;

On June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's ''Believe It or Not'' column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project, ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Gardner|first2=Chris|title=Burton takes rain check on Par pic|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/burton-takes-rain-check-on-par-pic-1200337853/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey put 'Believe' on hold|url=https://variety.com/2006/more/news/burton-carrey-put-believe-on-hold-1200337840/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Oedekerk brings 'Ripley' back to life|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/oedekerk-brings-ripley-back-to-life-1117955948/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding.&lt;ref name=Borat&gt;{{cite news|title=Borat's New-er Look|url=https://variety.com/2007/voices/columns/borats_newer_lo-1200571196/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Carrey lights up 'Phillip Morris'|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/carrey-lights-up-phillip-morris-1117966194/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton Off Believe It or Not?

In October 2008, [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Siegel|first2=Tatiana|title=Chris Columbus in talks for 'Ripley's': Paramount wants director for long-delayed film|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/chris-columbus-in-talks-for-ripley-s-1117994548/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Eric Roth]] was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Eric Roth takes on Ripley project: Jim Carrey remains attached to topline|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/eric-roth-takes-on-ripley-project-1118030181/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum in Bangalore - Jim Ankan Deka photo.jpg|thumb|Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum at Innovative Film City in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].]]
When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933, it was labeled Ripley’s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who "fainted" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], and [[Cleveland]]. In [[New York City|New York]], the famed [[Times Square]] exhibit opened in 1939 on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].

{{as of|2010|12}}, there are 32 Ripley's ''Believe It or Not!'' Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of ''Believe It or Not!'', are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]] and [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. Others are constructed oddly, such as the [[Orlando, Florida]] Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking.
Expected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the [[Netherlands]], at Dam square in [[Amsterdam]].

It was originally a [[Moorish Revival style]] mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home.

==Inaccuracies==
Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their [[television]] show, where they often say "If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real". However, two claims{{specify|date=December 2010}} appearing in their books have been dubbed "myths" by  [[MythBusters]].[Which ones?] One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], has had its accuracy called into question by [[Snopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/misxlate/toux.asp |title=Ma Sacrée Toux! |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By chronological order===
In the order in which they occur in the storyline (and when they occur):
# ''[[Without Remorse]]'' - Starts late 1970, in [[Hurricane Camille|Hurricane Camille's]] aftermath. Continues the following spring, in 1971. Epilogue is titled "February 12, 1973".
# ''[[Patriot Games]]'' (Begins in 1981 and continues through summer 1982, based on a reference to Ryan's age, which is 31 at the beginning of the novel) - Roughly fits with a reference to the Princess of Wales's first child being a baby and a few months old, Prince William was born in 1982. Discrepancies include the reference to a van having a likely year of manufacture of 1984. The subsequent events of ''Red Rabbit'' would seem to push its date back to 1981, rather than 1982.
# ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' - (Presumably starts in the spring of 1982 as Jack Ryan, Jr.'s age in the novel is given as 6 months, although the main action explicitly starts on August 15) - Discrepancies between 1982 in the Ryanverse and in actual events, aside from the date of the attempt on the Pope's life, include: the actual death of Mikhail Suslov in January 1982, frequent references to "Transformers" which did not appear until 1984, the fact that the Orioles played the Phillies in the World Series in 1983, the Baltimore Colts' relocation to Indianapolis not occurring until 1984, and a reference to "Coke Classic" which did not debut until the summer of 1985.
# ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1984) - However, the calendar used is for 1982 and Ryan is spending his first Christmas in London, having arrived in the previous novel.
# ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (1986) - The first chapter is set in January and states that Ryan is 35 years old. It also has references to the other books set earlier. For example, the Foleys have been in Moscow for almost four years. 
# ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1988) - The book refers to Jack's age as 40.  Troops are sent into Colombia to fight against the Medina Cartel and reduce drug shipments to America.
# ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1990–1991) - [[Israel]] partially cedes [[sovereignty]] over [[Jerusalem]] to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and the city becomes a United Nations protectorate policed by [[Swiss Guards]]. Residents of Jerusalem can choose between either Vatican, Israeli or Islamic judicial law. [[Denver]] is devastated by a terrorist nuclear explosion.  The book occurs after the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is implied that both events occur at the same time in the Ryan universe as in actual history (of the Soviet Union dissolution), 1991. In the earlier chapters it states that it had almost been two Novembers since President Fowler had been elected, making the beginning set in 1990. The video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]'' puts the atomic detonation in Denver as having occurred in 1989.
# ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' (1995–1996) - The U.S. and Russia destroy all of their [[ballistic missiles]].  After crippling the U.S. economy and becoming a nuclear power, [[Japan]] invades and takes the [[Marianas Islands]]; the United States and Japan fight a brief war, which the Japanese lose (they are subsequently [[denuclearization|denuclearized]]); an embittered Japanese pilot and proponent of the war crashes a [[Boeing 747|747]] into the [[United States Capitol|United States Capitol Building]] immediately after Ryan's confirmation vote for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], killing most of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], the [[POTUS|President]], all nine [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, the senior military establishment (including the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]), and most of the Cabinet; Ryan is left in charge of a gutted government. The end of the book occurs eleven months before 1997 presidential inauguration. Of interest, but not crucial to the plot of this or further books is that North and South Korea were said to be unified at some point between ''The Sum of All Fears'' and this book.
# ''[[Executive Orders]]'' (1996) - [[Saddam Hussein]] is [[assassinated]]; [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] merge forming the [[United Islamic Republic]]; the UIR launches a biological attack on the U.S. using the [[Ebola]] [[virus]]; the United States launches the Second [[Persian Gulf War]] against the UIR and defeats them; the Ayatollah is killed in a [[Precision-guided munition|smart-bomb]] attack by the U.S.
# ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'' (1999–2000) - events are based on the [[Sydney Olympics]] held in 2000, RAINBOW&amp;nbsp;— an elite counter-terrorist force&amp;nbsp;— is created and engages terrorists across Europe. Ecoterrorists plan to create a genetically-enhanced virus based on [[Ebola]] and [[cancer]] cells, which they plan to use to wipe out much of the world's population.
# ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'' (2002) - Russia is admitted to NATO; China and Russia fight a major war, in which the U.S. intervenes on its [[NATO]] ally's side. It implies that the [[British Prime Minister]] is [[Tony Blair]]. Ryan has won election as president (2001-2004) but does not stand for reelection.  His vice president Robby Jackson runs in 2004, but is killed just before the election giving Edward Kealty a "default" victory.
# ''[[The Teeth of the Tiger]]'' (2006, based on the age of Jack Ryan, Jr.) - The U.S. is now engaged in a [[War on Terrorism|global war on terrorism]], in response to the September 11 attacks, which occurred in the Ryan universe as they did in the real world.  It is mentioned that the wars in [[war in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[war in Iraq|Iraq]] occurred in the Ryan universe continuity, and that the Jerusalem Treaty signed in ''The Sum of All Fears'' was not entirely successful as some Israelis and [[Palestinians]] continue fighting each other.
# ''[[Dead or Alive (novel)|Dead or Alive]]'' (2007, based on Jack Ryan's announcement that he would run against [[Ed Kealty]] for President "in the coming year") — The Umayyad Revolutionary Council (the Ryan universe version of [[Al-Qaeda]]) and its leader "The Emir" (based on [[Osama bin Laden]]) plan a string of major attacks on the U.S. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue, as in our timeline, and President Kealty is in the process of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. A character decoding encrypted messages explicitly refers to the date as May 2010, but this must be seen as a contradiction in the Jack Ryan continuity as Ed Kealty is a one term president (2005-2008).
# ''[[Locked On (novel)|Locked On]]'' (2008, based on Jack Ryan Sr.'s campaign for re-election) - Jack Ryan Sr. is running for president against incumbent Edward Kealty, who wants to serve a second term (2009-2012). The election happening in this book requires the events take place in 2008.
# ''[[Threat Vector (novel)|Threat Vector]]'' (2009, explicitly stated as six months after the previous novel) - Ryan Sr. has been sworn in as president of the United States after having been elected the previous year.
# ''[[Command Authority (novel)|Command Authority]]'' (2010, explicitly states that Ryan Sr. is in the second year of his second presidential term) - it is implied the novel takes place about five months after the events of ''Threat Vector'' in the springtime. Based on the timelines of previous books, the 'Thirty years earlier' chapters must still take place in 1983 (and are therefore actually 27 years earlier).
# ''[[Support and Defend]]'' (2014)
# ''[[Full Force and Effect]]'' (2014)
# ''[[Under Fire (2015 novel)|Under Fire]]'' (2015)
# ''[[Commander in Chief (novel)|Commander in Chief]]'' (2015)

==Characters==
===Main characters in the Ryanverse===
The key characters in the Ryanverse include:
* '''[[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]''': Born in [[Baltimore]] in 1950, earned an [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|NROTC]] commission in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] at [[Boston College]]. Medically discharged at the rank of [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|2nd Lieutenant]] following a helicopter crash, he worked as an investment broker briefly and made a fortune. He was later recommended to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], where he rose rapidly through the ranks, eventually becoming a [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]]. Following by a short period as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serving under Roger Durling. Durling is assassinated (with most of the government) at the end of ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', and Ryan is sworn in as [[President of the United States]] and serves two terms and deals with international crises in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific.
* '''[[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]]''': Born in [[Indianapolis]] in 1944 as John Terrence Kelly. he joined the Navy during the [[Vietnam War]] and became a [[Navy SEAL]] who participated in several special operations. After his first tour of duty, Kelly left the service, and he met and married his first wife, Patricia who was subsequently killed in a [[car accident]] when her car went under a tractor/trailer unit. she was pregnant at the time. Kelly returned to active service when he was hired by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] (Special Operations Group). At the same time Kelly fought a personal vendetta against organised crime in the US that resulted in a need to fake his own death and change his name to "John Clark". While recovering from injuries sustained in his battles at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], he meets his future second wife, nurse Sandra "Sandy" O'Toole, and they eventually had two daughters, Patricia Doris and Margaret Pamela. Clark works as Jack Ryan's personal driver and bodyguard for a time, and they work together in a number of situations, and when Ryan becomes [[President of the United States]] he instructs Clark to undertake a number of covert operations, and he later gives Clark a pardon all unsanctioned activities that Clark had undertaken.
* '''Domingo “Ding” Chavez''': Born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1968, he joined the [[U.S. Army]] to escape street life, and was recruited to be a member of a secret [[CIA]]-run anti-drug operation in [[Colombia]], where he first meets his mentor, John Clark. Over time he completes at least two advanced degrees and becomes fluent in English, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, and Persian. Chavez is shown to have a somewhat cocky attitude, being younger than his mentor, John Clark. He appears vengeful at times, however, he is not shown to be a ruthless, cold blooded killer such as some of his contemporaries. In [[Debt of Honor]], he is sickened after being forced to use a high-intensity light to blind the pilots of Japanese AWACS planes coming in to land, causing the aircraft to crash. He later marries John Clark's daughter, Patricia, and  they name their child John Conor Chavez. Clark and Chavez lead multiple operations for President Ryan.

===Presidents in the Ryanverse===
A total of five presidents are explicitly shown in the Ryanverse (although ''Red Rabbit'' takes place during the Reagan Administration, Reagan does not make an appearance as a character):
* The unnamed man referred to only as "the President," first introduced in ''The Hunt for Red October''; he remains in office through ''The Cardinal of the Kremlin'', and ''Clear and Present Danger''.  At the end of the last novel, he runs for reelection and is defeated.
* '''J. Robert Fowler,''' former governor of Ohio, who defeats the incumbent at the end of ''Clear and Present Danger'' and is in office during ''The Sum of All Fears''.  After his failure to handle the Denver crisis nearly results in nuclear war, he resigns from office at the end of the novel.
* '''Roger Durling,''' Fowler's vice-president, former governor of California and a Vietnam veteran with service in the [[82nd Airborne Division]].  Durling replaces Fowler when the latter resigns, and is the President in ''Debt of Honor'', completing Fowler's term as President. At the end of the novel, he is killed along with most of the government when a Japanese jetliner is crashed into the Capitol Building.
* '''[[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy)|John Patrick Ryan]]''' is confirmed as Durling's new vice-president at the end of ''Debt of Honor'', and is sworn in as President when Durling is murdered on the same day.  His claim to the presidency is contested by Durling's former VP Edward Kealty, but the courts eventually rule in Ryan's favor.  He remains in office in ''Executive Orders'', ''Rainbow Six'' (though he never appears) and ''The Bear and the Dragon''.
* '''[[Robby Jackson (Tom Clancy)|Robert Jefferson "Robby" Jackson]]''' succeeded Ryan as President of the United States after Ryan retired (as described in ''[[The Teeth of the Tiger]]''), with Ryan believing he could leave the country in Robby's capable hands. After serving out the remainder of Ryan's term, Robby campaigned for his own re-election. While travelling in Mississippi, however, Jackson was shot and subsequently assassinated by a 67-year-old man who was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]; Duane Farmer. Farmer was taken alive and swiftly executed for his crimes.
* '''Edward Jonathan Kealty''': Durling's former vice-president, replaced by Jack Ryan after a sex scandal.  During ''Executive Orders'', he tries to steal the presidency from Ryan by claiming that he never actually resigned, but those allegations are tossed out by U.S. courts.  After Ryan leaves office and Jackson is assassinated, Kealty is elected President in his own right, a position he holds in ''The Teeth of the Tiger'' though he is never seen.&lt;ref name="RJP"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Setting is an important element in a narrative and in some works the setting becomes a character itself. The term setting is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[novelist]] [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pp.110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.

==Types==
Setting may take various forms:
* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]
* [[Dystopia]]
* [[Fantasy world]]
* [[Fictional city]]
* [[Fictional country]]
* [[Fictional crossover]]
* [[Fictional location]]
* [[Fictional universe]]
* [[Future history]]
* [[Imaginary world]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7640">'''Social media use in hiring''' refers to the examination by employers of job applicants' [[social media]] profiles as part of the hiring assessment. Some employers use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees. 
==Ethical implications==
This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider [[discrimination]]. Except in the states of California, Maryland, and Illinois, there are no laws that prohibit employers from using social media profiles as a basis of whether or not someone should be hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu-mn.org/news/2012/03/06/aclu-mn-files-lawsuit-against-minnewaska-area-schools |title=ACLU-MN Files Lawsuit Against Minnewaska Area Schools |website=www.aclu-mn.org |access-date=2016-11-30|date=March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title VII]] also prohibits discrimination during any aspect of employment including hiring or firing, recruitment, or testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/employers-schools-and-social-networking-privacy |title=Employers, Schools, and Social Networking Privacy |newspaper=American Civil Liberties Union |access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has been integrating into the workplace and this has led to conflicts within employees and employers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Social media#cite note-Buettner2015c-107|[107]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Particularly, Facebook has been seen as a popular platform for employers to investigate in order to learn more about potential employees. This conflict first started in Maryland when an employer requested and received an employee's Facebook username and password. State lawmakers first introduced legislation in 2012 to prohibit employers from requesting passwords to personal social accounts in order to get a job or to keep a job. This led to Canada, Germany, the U.S. Congress and 11 U.S. states to pass or propose legislation that prevents employers' access to private social accounts of employees.&lt;sup&gt;[[Social media#cite note-108|[108]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand them to give forth their username or password for a social media account.&lt;ref name="Marche2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marche, S. |year=2012 |title=Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws that forbid employers from disciplining an employee based on activity off the job on social media sites have also been put into act in states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, North Dakota, and New York. Several states have similar laws that protect students in colleges and universities from having to grant access to their social media accounts. Eight states have passed the law that prohibits post secondary institutions from demanding social media login information from any prospective or current students and privacy legislation has been introduced or is pending in at least 36 states as of July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turkle, S. |year=2012 |title=Alone together: Why we expect more from technology and less from each other |location=New York, NY |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-03146-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2014, legislation has been introduced and is in the process of pending in at least 28 states and has been enacted in Maine and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the National Labor Relations Board has been devoting a lot of their attention to attacking employer policies regarding social media that can discipline employees who seek to speak and post freely on social media sites.

Use of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 survey of recruiters found that 93% of them check candidates' social media postings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Susie|last= Poppick |date=September 5, 2014 |url=http://time.com/money/3019899/10-facebook-twitter-mistakes-lost-job-snake/ |title=10 Social Media Blunders That Cost a Millennial a Job — or Worse|work=Money Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, professor Stijn Baert of [[Ghent University]] conducted a field experiment in which fictitious job candidates applied for real job vacancies in Belgium. They were identical except in one respect: their Facebook profile photos. It was found that candidates with the most wholesome photos were a lot more likely to receive invitations for job interviews than those with the more controversial photos. In addition, Facebook profile photos had a greater impact on hiring decisions when candidates were highly educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baert |first=S. |year=2015 |url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp9584.pdf |title=Do They Find You on Facebook? Facebook Profile Picture and Hiring Chances |id=IZA Discussion Paper No. 9584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases have created some [[privacy]] implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employee's Facebook profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/23/facebook-says-it-may-launch-legal-action-against-employers-who-ask-for-user-passwords/ |title=Facebook May Take Legal Action Over Employer Password Requests |author=Matt Brian |date=23 March 2012 |work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation of Facebook policy. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326598317390057 |title=Protecting Your Passwords and Your Privacy |work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27452">'''Stage combat''' or '''fight choreography''' is a specialised technique in [[theatre]] designed to create the [[illusion]] of physical [[combat]] without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live [[stage plays]] as well as [[operatic]] and [[ballet]] productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the [[choreography]] of [[film]]ed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of [[stunts]] and is a common field of study for [[actor]]s. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in [[dance]] or [[martial art]]s training.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with [[Aristotle]] quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chpt. 6, Sect. II. Line 16-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or indeed it may be traced to the [[origins of the human species]] and [[primate]] [[display behaviour]]. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in [[warrior|warrior societies]], and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into [[war dance]]s. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where [[Herodotus]] in his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histories|last=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Book II|location=|pages=Line 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.

===Post-classical history===
Fights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman [[gladiator]]s, and any public [[duel]], such as the [[judicial duel]] of the [[European Middle Ages]]. The [[medieval tournament]] and [[jousting|joust]] are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] developed into a [[sport]] with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary [[Formula One]] races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with [[fencing schools]]. Some German [[fechtbuch]] ("combat manuals", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such ''Klopffechten'' ("knockabout fighting"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (''fechten zu schimpf'', 'rant fighting') and real combat (''fechten zu ernst'', 'earnest fighting').

The history of European theatrical combat has its roots in [[medieval theatre]], and becomes tangible in [[Elizabethan drama]]. [[Richard Tarlton|Richard Tarleton]], who was a member of both William [[Shakespeare]]'s acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stage Fights|last=Gordon|first=Gilbert|publisher=Theatre Art Books|year=1973|isbn=0-87830-131-3|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern History===
During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese ''[[Kabuki]]'' theater (as ''tachimawari'' "fighting scenes"), Chinese [[Beijing Opera]] and Indian theater.

[[fencing (sport)|Fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]] and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Tony. (2009) "A Terrific Combat!!! Theatrical Duels, Brawls and Battles, 1800-1920"[/]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gounod - Faust, act IV - Duel scene - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|The beginning of a staged duel from Act IV of Gounod's ''Faust.'' ]]
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats", identified by names such as the "Round Eights" and the "Glasgow Tens".

[[Cinematic fencing]] has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was [[Paddy Crean]] who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in [[Errol Flynn filmography|Errol Flynn movies]], among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mayafair|title=The Fight Master: A Documentary about Paddy Crean|date=2008-03-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mW6P8bZADk&amp;t=330s|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. H. Barry]] and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/a-e/b.h.-barry|title=http://www.primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/a-e/b.h.-barry|website=www.primarystagesoffcenter.org|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Allen Suddeth founded the National Fight Directors Training Program in the United States and wrote the book "Fight Direction for the Theater" (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.safd.org/MemberProfile/Details/31025|title=https://www.safd.org/MemberProfile/Details/31025|last=Suddeth|first=J. Allen|date=|website=www.safd.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martial arts movies]] emerge as a distinct genre from the 1940s, popularized by [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Sonny Chiba]] from the 1960s.

Informal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the [https://www.safd.org/ Society of American Fight Directors] in 1977.

Following this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The [[British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)]] and [http://www.fdc.ca/ Fight Directors Canada (FDC)] in 1993; the [https://safdi.org.au/ Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi)] in 1994; the [http://nordicstagefight.com/ Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS)] and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; [http://www.artofcombat.org/ Art of Combat] in 1997; [http://www.stage-combat.de/ Stage Combat Deutschland] in 2004; and the [https://www.australianstagecombat.org.au/ Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA)] in 2010; [http://thebritishguildofstagecombat.blogspot.com/ The British Guild of Stage Combat] in 2015. As of 2005, [[East 15 Acting School]], [[London]] offered a [[B.A. (Hons)]] Degree in ''Acting &amp; Stage Combat.'' Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.

==Techniques==
[[File:Sword parts no scabbard.PNG|alt=Diagram of a sword and it's parts.|thumb|The parts of a sword.]]
Stage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques;  theatrical adaptations of various forms of [[historical fencing|fencing]] such as [[rapier]] and [[dagger]], [[smallsword]] and [[broadsword]], as well as the use of other weapons, notably the [[quarterstaff]] and [[knives]]; and more specialized skills such as [[professional wrestling]] and different styles of [[martial arts]]. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.

The over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.

Another important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The Society of American Fight Directors. ''Glossary of Terms''. Updated 3/19/16. http://www.safd.org.&lt;/ref&gt; This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. 

The combat phase of a play [[rehearsal]] is referred to as a ''fight rehearsal''. Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much [[training]] and [[experience]] as possible. A "fight call" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to "mark" through the fight to increase their [[muscle memory]]. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a ''fight captain'', who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. 

The fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escrime-ffe.fr/images/stories/FFE/PRATIQUER/LES-DIFFERENTES-PRATIQUES/ARTISTIQUE/Livret_Escrime_Artistique-web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017005544/http://escrime-ffe.fr/images/stories/FFE/PRATIQUER/LES-DIFFERENTES-PRATIQUES/ARTISTIQUE/Livret_Escrime_Artistique-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.

== Types of weapons used in stage combat ==
For stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.
[[File:Quarterstaff line drawing - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumb|Quarterstaff fight]]

=== Quarterstaff ===
Used in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular [[quarterstaff]] fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of [[Robin Hood]] from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the [[Bō|bō staff]] from the Japanese martial art [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]] which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous [[Kabuki]] play ''[[Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura]]'' written in 1748.

=== Broadsword ===
[[File:Rapier MET sfeah29.16.10 004.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Rapier sword.]]
A large sword commonly used in the early [[Middle Ages]] in Europe. The [[broadsword]] was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' and is also seen in fantasy epics like ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]''.

=== Rapier ===
First school instructing on the correct use of the [[rapier]] in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weapons in the theatre|last=Wise|first=Arthur|publisher=Barnes and Noble|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5, 123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonetti took over the lease from playwright [[John Lyly]] to open his school in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Methods and Practice of Elizabethan Swordplay|last=Turner|first=Craig|last2=Soper|first2=Tony|publisher=Southern University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Carbondale, IL|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.
[[File:The art of fencing, or, the use of the small sword Fleuron T123392-15.png|thumb|Two men dueling using the smallsword.]]

=== Smallsword ===
The [[Small sword|smallsword]] came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Hampton play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' by [[Christopher Hampton]] written in 1985, based on the 1782 [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|novel of the same name]].
[[File:Knife fighting practice. Training session led by Dmitry Dyomushkin – Photo 002.jpg|thumb|Two opponents face off in a knife fighting rehearsal.]]

=== Knife ===
There are many styles of knives from the [[Bowie knife]] to a [[switchblade]]. [[Knife fight|Knife fights]] tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in ''[[West Side Story]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]],'' written in 1875.

[[File:Arbo-Valkyrien 1864.jpg|thumb|Approximate size and shape of shield used in stage combat.]]

=== Sword and shield ===
The [[Shield|shields]] used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's [[Wars of the Roses]] history plays.

=== Unarmed ===
This consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as [[aikido]] and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' when Othello strangles Desdemona.

=== Found Objects ===
Found objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, [[sugar glass]] molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.
[[File:Katana moderne.JPG|thumb|Example of a katana.]]

=== Japanese weapons ===
Other weapons like a [[katana]], a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and [[Nunchaku|nunchuks]] can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.
[[File:Battle-axe (PSF).png|thumb|Example of a battle axe.]]

=== Melee weapons ===
[[Melee weapon|Melee weapons]] are used in large battle scenes and can include [[Spear|spears]], [[Axe|axes]], [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[Flail (weapon)|flails]], and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.

==Realism in fight choreography==
Fight choreography can vary widely from true [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to outright [[fantasy]] depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)]], by [[Edmond Rostand]], using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.

One school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted [[suspension of disbelief]].

==Types of choreographed fights==

===In theater===
Having its roots in [[Medieval theatre]], stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]] ([[Shakespeare]]'s simple and oft seen stage direction, ''they fight'').

===On film===
{{main|Combat in film}}
[[File:The three musketeers fairbanks.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for [[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|''The Three Musketeers'']] (1921) starring Douglas Fairbanks.]]

Cinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Britannica, s.v. fencing.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with [[Errol Flynn]] from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in  the wake of
''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] puts it, "movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique".
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, the fights for which are choreographed by [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] &amp; Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V &amp; VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II &amp; III), tend to portray its [[lightsaber combat]] using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as [[lightsaber]]s or [[the Force]], whereas the action featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by [[Wolf System stage combat training|Tony Wolf]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Sonny Chiba]], [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Jackie Chan]], who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. [[Hong Kong]]-based fight choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]] is known for his work on ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]], in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as [[bullet time]]. [[Ching Siu-tung]] is particularly noted in the field of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] for his use of graceful [[wire fu]] techniques. By contrast, films such as ''[[The Duellists]]'', fight directed by William Hobbs, ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', fight directed by Robert Bruce and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' &amp;  [[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]], fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' movies.

===Combat reenactment===
{{main|Combat reenactment|Historical martial arts reconstruction}}

'''Combat reenactment''' is a side of [[historical reenactment]] which aims to depict events of battle, normally a specific engagement in history, but also unscripted battles where the 'winner' is not predetermined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''''The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations''''' is a descriptive list which was created by [[Georges Polti]] to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this Polti analyzed classical [[ancient Greece|Greek]] texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of [[Carlo Gozzi]], who also identified 36 situations.

==Publication history==
{{quote box|align=right|width=300px|quote=“Gozzi maintained that there can be but thirty-six tragic situations. Schiller took great pains to find more, but he was unable to find even so many as Gozzi.” |source= —[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polti |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Polti |title=The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:The_thirty-six_dramatic_situations_(1921).djvu |year=1921 |month= |origyear=1916 |publisher=James Knapp Reeve |location=Franklin, Ohio |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples.  The original French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted to this day.

The list is popularized as an aid for writers, but it is also used by dramatists, [[storytelling|storyteller]]s and many others. Other similar lists have since been made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4135">'''Virtual Print Fee''' (VPF) is a subsidy paid by a [[film distributor]] towards the purchase of [[digital cinema]] projection equipment for use by a [[film exhibitor]] in the presentation of first release motion pictures.  The subsidy is paid in the form of a fee per booking of a movie, intended to match the savings that occurs by not shipping a film print.  The model is designed to help redistribute the savings realized by studios when using digital distribution instead of film print distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkpe.com/digital_cinema/faqs/|title=Digital Cinema Business FAQs|first=MKPE Consulting|last=LLC|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first public demonstration of digital projection for cinema took place at ShoWest in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital cinema#Technology demonstrations and system prototyping]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was readily apparent that the technology was further ahead than the business model.  Early technology presentations attempted to claim that the technology would pay for itself through new revenues generated by new forms of content. But exhibitors knew their audience, and could see that digital projection was only a replacement technology, creating new financial liabilities, and not new revenue.  It wasn’t until the rollout of digital 3-D years later in 2005 that digital projection demonstrated that it could be used to generate additional revenue.

The economics were challenging.  Film projectors and platters cost in the neighborhood of US$30,000, while early digital projectors cost up to US$150,000.  Further, film projectors had a lifetime of 30 years with relatively small annual expenditures in maintenance and replacement parts.  On the other hand, exhibitors felt they would be lucky to get 10 years of service from a digital projector, after which there would have to be a refresh in capital expenditure.  Meanwhile, distributors would realize significant savings by eliminating the high cost of film prints with corresponding shipping costs, and instead distributing digital files either by satellite or hard drive. 

The Virtual Print Fee was designed to better balance savings and expenditures for both exhibitors and distributors.  It is intended to primarily assist in the replacement of film projectors, and not assist in the purchase of new projection equipment for new construction.  To give confidence to financial institutions that digital cinema technology was stable and worthy of investment, [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] was created in 2002, resulting in the release of the first version of the DCI Digital Cinema System Specification in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcimovies.com|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) - DIGITAL CINEMA SYSTEM SPECIFICATION, VERSION 1.2|first=|last=companyv|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DCI Specification continues to be the core specification for digital cinema, establishing the baseline technology and system requirements for which studios will release digital movies.

The first set of VPF agreements executed with four major studios were announced by Christie/AIX in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.cinedigm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=210434|title=NEW SONY PICTURES AGREEMENT WITH CHRISTIE/AIX SUPPORTS DIGITAL CINEMA TRANSITION (NASDAQ:CIDM)|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christie/AIX at that time was a subsidiary of Access Integrated Technology, now renamed [[Cinedigm]] Digital Cinema Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinedigm.com/|title=Home - Cinedigm|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The agreements were for the rollout of digital cinema technology to 4000 screens.  Since that time, numerous other Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements have been executed around the world, allowing exhibitors in nearly every territory to benefit from VPF subsidies in the conversion from film projection to digital projection.

'''w00tstock''' is a touring [[variety show]] billed as "3 Hours of Geeks &amp; Music". It was created in 2009 by [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Adam Savage]] and [[Paul and Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin L. Ray. [http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2010/06/w00tstock-moments.html "Five Reasons Why You Should Go to w00tstock".] ''[[Paste Magazine]]'', 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denmead, Ken (October 20, 2009). [http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2009/10/w00tstock-ftw/ "W00tstock FTW!".] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]: Geek Dad''.
&lt;/ref&gt; The first shows took place in 2009 in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]], and as of July 2015, a total of 20 shows had been presented.

The name is a play on words combining [[Woodstock]], the notable 1969 [[counterculture]] music festival, and [[w00t]], a piece of internet slang that expresses excitement.

==The versions==
Though the headliners for the show are [[Adam Savage]], [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[Paul and Storm]], each evening’s performance includes a different group of special guests and is subtitled with a different version number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74384">In August 1992, the American film director [[Woody Allen]] was accused by his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, then seven years old, of having sexually assaulted her in the home of her adoptive mother, the actor [[Mia Farrow]], in [[Bridgewater, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; Allen has repeatedly denied the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woody-allen-defends-himself-on-60-minutes-in-92/|title=Woody Allen defends himself on '60 Minutes' in '92|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate= February 8, 2018|archivedate=November 22, 2014| archiveurl=https://archive.is/VNhj0|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt;

When the allegation was made, Farrow and Allen had been in a 12-year relationship and had three children together: two adopted children, Dylan and Moses, and one biological son, Satchel (now known as [[Ronan Farrow]]).&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; The assault is alleged to have taken place eight months after Farrow learned that Allen had been having an affair with another of her adoptive daughters, [[Soon-Yi Previn]], who married Allen in 1997; Previn was a first-year undergraduate when Farrow found out about the relationship.&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt; Allen alleges that the affair prompted Mia Farrow to concoct the assault allegation as an act of vengeance.&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt; The Connecticut [[State's Attorney]] investigated the allegation but did not press charges,&lt;ref name=Henneberger25Sept1993/&gt; and the New York Department of Social Services found "no credible evidence" to support it.&lt;ref name=PerezPena26Oct1993/&gt; In response to the allegation, Allen sued Farrow for sole custody of Dylan, Satchel and Moses.&lt;ref name=Weber14Aug1992/&gt; He lost the case in June 1993; the judge denied him visitation rights with Dylan, gave him limited, supervised visitation with Satchel, and allowed Moses, a teenager, to decide for himself.&lt;ref name=Marks8June1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shea7Feb2014/&gt; The decision was upheld on appeal in 1994&lt;ref name=appeal1994/&gt; and 1995.&lt;ref name=appeal1995/&gt;

Dylan Farrow has repeated the allegation several times as an adult. Her first public comment was in an interview with [[Maureen Orth]] for ''Vanity Fair'' in 2013,&lt;ref name=OrthOct2013/&gt; followed by an open letter in the&lt;!--CMOS 8.170--&gt; ''New York Times'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=Farrow1Feb2014/&gt; a ''Los Angeles Times'' [[op-ed]] in December 2017,&lt;ref name=Farrow7Dec2017/&gt;.
Woody Allen has also spoken publicly about the allegations, in an interview with [[Gayle King]] for ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' in  a ''New York Times'' op-ed&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt; and in 2018 with a statement to CBS, denying the allegation in both.&lt;ref name=CBS2018re&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woody-allen-responds-dylan-farrow-sexual-abuse-allegations/|title=Woody  responds to Dylan Farrow sexual abuse allegations|date=January 18, 2018|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Allen and Farrow===
Woody Allen and Mia Farrow began a 12-year relationship in 1980, during which Farrow starred in 13 of Allen's films.&lt;ref name=OrthOct2013&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow| title=Momma Mia!| first=Maureen|last=Orth|author-link=Maureen Orth|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| date= October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained separate apartments in [[Manhattan]] throughout the relationship—Farrow on [[Central Park West]]&lt;ref name=Smith8May1994/&gt; and Allen on [[Fifth Avenue]]—and did not marry; they had both been married twice.&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991/&gt;

[[File:Mia Farrow 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mia Farrow]], 2012]]
When the relationship began, Farrow had seven children: three biological sons from her marriage to composer [[André Previn]]; three adopted girls (two Vietnamese and one Korean, [[Soon-Yi Previn]]); and one adopted Korean boy, Moses.&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991&gt;{{cite news | title=Woody and Mia: A New York Story |first=Eric|last=Lax|work=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1991|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/magazine/woody-and-mia-a-new-york-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woody Allen, Mia Farrow family tree|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/showbiz/gallery/allen-farrow-family-tree/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1985 she adopted a baby girl, Dylan, from Texas. Allen was not involved in the adoption, but when Dylan arrived he assumed a parental role toward her and began spending more time in Farrow's home. He and Farrow went on holiday to Europe several times with the Farrow–Previn children between 1987 and 1989.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=Inside the Shocking Custody Case Court Documents that Shed Light on the Dylan Farrow-Woody Allen Saga|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga|work=The Daily Beast|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1987 Farrow gave birth to Allen's biological son, Satchel (later known as [[Ronan Farrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/22/arts/son-born-to-mia-farrow-and-woody-allen.html | title = Son Born to Mia Farrow And Woody Allen | agency = Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times | date= December 22, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow wanted to adopt another child in 1991; Allen said he would not take "a lousy attitude toward it" so long as she agreed to his adoption of Dylan and Moses,&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; and in October that year she adopted another Vietnamese child.{{efn|Farrow found that the child was too disabled and needed more care than she could provide; she helped to find him another family.&lt;ref name=Smith8May1994&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dinitia|first1=Smith|title=Picking Up The Legos And The Pieces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-feature.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses was finalized on December 17, 1991.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;

}}
According to her testimony during the custody trial, Farrow became concerned about Allen's behavior around Dylan in 1987–1988. She reportedly told Allen that he was paying too much attention to Dylan and failing to give her "breathing room". He had allegedly read to Dylan while in his underwear, allowed her to suck his thumb, and would sit on her bed in the morning waiting for her to wake up.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; Farrow would later testify that she found Allen's relationship with Dylan at this time "relentless and overpowering" and said it had "a wooing quality". &lt;ref name="wmr"&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/ "Mia: I worried about Woody being a homosexual"]. William M. Reilly, March 25, 1993. [[UPI.com]]. Retrieved 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow also told her therapist that she feared Woody "would abuse Satchel", and that she also worried that Allen had a sexual relationship "with another man".&lt;ref name="wmr" /&gt; On one occasion, Dylan allegedly locked herself in the bathroom for four hours when he arrived; Allen had an employee pick the lock with a coat hanger.&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993/&gt; The family psychologist, Dr. Susan Coates, witnessed some of Allen's behavior and testified during the custody trial in 1993 that she did not see it as sexual, but as "inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else".&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks30March1993/&gt; Allen said later that he had paid extra attention to Dylan to compensate for the time Farrow was spending with the newborn, Satchel.&lt;ref name=appeal1994/&gt; He agreed in 1990 to discuss the issue in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt;

===Relationship with Previn===
In or around 1991 Allen began an affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. According to Allen, it began in late December 1991.&lt;ref name=PerezPena23March1993/&gt; According to Farrow, it began while Previn was in her final year of high school, which ended in June 1991. She alleges that Dylan saw Allen and Previn on the bed together in the summer or autumn of 1991.&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=Farrow Says Daughter Became Distraught Over Allen's Relentless Attention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-trial.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bones of contention has been how old Previn was at the time. When Farrow and André Previn adopted her from [[Seoul]] in 1978, the Seoul family court gave her a "presumptive birth date" of October 8, 1970; she had been abandoned and was living in that city's St. Paul's Orphanage.{{efn|"Information concerning this case was obtained from Mr. and Mrs. André G. Previn&amp;nbsp;... The beneficiary, Soon Hee Oh, aka Soon Yi Oh, is a native and citizen of Korea with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congressional Serial Set, Issue 13173, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1TYoAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Soon+Hee+Oh,+aka+Soon+Yi+Oh%22 170].&lt;/ref&gt; "Memorandum of information concerning H.R. 1352 for the relief of Oh Soon Hee submitted by the American Embassy at Seoul, Korea. The beneficiary is an abandoned child, who was found in Seoul, Korea on February 12, 1976. She was placed temporarily in the care of Maria's House, a local institution for abandoned children while an effort was made to identify and locate her parents and relatives. When this search failed, the beneficiary was transferred to the care of St. Paul's Orphanage&amp;nbsp;... in Seoul, where she currently lives. The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) in her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970.

Another criticism was that the team was unwilling to testify in court, except via Leventhal's deposition.{{sfnp|Ewing|McCann|2006|p=160}}

====Decision====
In his 33-page decision in June 1993,&lt;ref name=Shea7Feb2014/&gt; Justice Elliott Wilk rejected Allen's bid for custody of the three children, and denied Allen immediate visitation rights with Dylan, saying of Allen's behavior toward Dylan that it was "grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her".&lt;ref name=Shea7Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks8June1993/&gt;{{sfnp|Ewing|McCann|2006|p=161}} His criticism of Allen's parenting was harsh.{{sfnp|Ewing|McCann|2006|pp=160–161}}&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; Rejecting Allen's portrayal of Farrow as a "woman scorned", Wilk said there was no credible evidence that she had coached Dylan, and he criticized Allen for his "trial strategy" of turning family members and employees against one another.

===Criminal inquiry, social services===
The police interviewed Allen in Litchfield in January 1993 for over three hours. He said he had never been in the attic crawl space; when the police said they had taken fingerprints in there, he said it was possible that his prints were there. On September 20 that year, Frank Maco, the State's Attorney, accompanied by a female police detective, talked to Dylan; Maco told a reporter in 1997: "I saw complete withdrawal any time I tried to discuss the incident."&lt;ref name=ThibaultNov1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthOct2013/&gt;

On September 24, 1993, Maco held a news conference to say that he would not pursue the molestation allegation, despite having [[probable cause]], citing a desire not to traumatize Dylan.&lt;ref name=ThibaultNov1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thibault|first1=Andy|title=People: Frank Maco|url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/the-connecticut-story/mia-farrow-s-vanity-fair-interview-references-connecticut-magazine-article/article_4327cac7-ffef-5eb5-9c19-fdaf70e84855.html|work=Connecticut Magazine|date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henneberger25Sept1993&gt;{{cite news |first=Melinda|last=Henneberger|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/25/nyregion/connecticut-prosecutor-won-t-file-charges-against-woody-allen.html | title = Connecticut Prosecutor Won't File Charges Against Woody Allen | work = The New York Times | date = September 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS18Jan2018&gt;{{cite news|title=Dylan Farrow details her sexual assault allegations against Woody Allen|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dylan-farrow-interview-today-gayle-king-full-transcript-woody-allen-me-too/|publisher=CBS News|date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a letter to the New York Department of Social Sevices, Allen's psychotherapist Kathryn Prescott stated that Allen's psychological profile "was definitely not that of a sexual offender" and also stated “There has never been any suggestion that Mr. Allen was suffering from a sexual perversion / deviant sexual behavior”. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1241&amp;dat=19930421&amp;id=Y35TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FIYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6340,6035301&amp;hl=en "Therapist says Woody Allen No Sex Offender"].

Retrieved 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Department of Social Services closed its own 14-month investigation in October 1993; its letter to Allen stated: "No credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.

In addition, Maco had sent a copy of his statement to the judge who was deciding whether to overturn Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses. That act was "inappropriate, unsolicited and potentially prejudicial", the panel ruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Panel Criticizes Prosecutor In Inquiry on Woody Allen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/nyregion/panel-criticizes-prosecutor-in-inquiry-on-woody-allen.html|work=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allen's appeals, other legal action===
In December 1992 Farrow began legal action, which was ultimately unsuccessful, to have Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses declared void. Her position was based, in part, on her view that Allen's affair with Soon-Yi Previn had begun before the adoption was finalized on December 17, 1991.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Farrow Spurns Allen's Plea For a Truce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/nyregion/farrow-spurns-allen-s-plea-for-a-truce.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; Allen stated that the sexual relationship had started in the last week of 1991.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt; Allen offered not to appeal the custody ruling if Farrow would drop her attempt to have his adoption of Dylan and Moses declared void, but she refused.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt;

In January 1994 Allen appealed Wilk's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez Pena|first1=Richard|title=Woody Allen Appeals Judgment in Custody Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/nyregion/woody-allen-appeals-judgment-in-custody-case.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the assault allegation, the appellate court stated that its "review of the record militates against a finding that Ms. Farrow fabricated the allegations without any basis". Although the Yale–New Haven team's view that Dylan had a tendency to "withdraw into a fantasy", and that she had offered inconsistent accounts, had to be taken into account, the court stated that "the testimony given at trial by the individuals caring for the children that day, the videotape of Dylan made by Ms. Farrow the following day and the accounts of Dylan's behavior toward Mr. Allen both before and after the alleged instance of abuse, suggest that the abuse did occur." It added that "the evidence in support of the allegations remains inconclusive". The court was critical of Allen's parenting skills and relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. The appeal failed, although two of the five judges said the visitation rights regarding Satchel were too restrictive.&lt;ref name=appeal1994&gt;[https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994524197ad2d3271461 Allen v.

In her 1997 memoir, ''What Falls Away'', Farrow repeated the accusation that Allen had sexually abused Dylan Farrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrow|first1=Mia|title=What Falls Away|date=1997|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|page=271|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow's abuse allegation was mentioned in several of the book's reviews. &lt;ref&gt;" Ms. Farrow claimed that Mr. Allen had long been focusing inappropriate sexual attention on their 7-year-old adoptive daughter Dylan."[https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/01/bsp/25818.html]"Intimate Strangers".

Dylan's brother Moses Farrow, who was 14 in 1992, has taken a different view; he has reconciled with Allen and is now estranged from the Farrow family. When Dylan published her open letter, he said in an interview that several people had been in the house on the disputed day and that "no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces". He asserted that Mia Farrow had cultivated a climate in which he and his siblings had felt compelled to support her views, and that she had both physically and emotionally abused him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Rothman|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dylan-farrows-brother-moses-mia-farrow-woody-allen/story?id=22377303|title=Dylan Farrow's Brother Moses Says Mia Farrow, Not Woody Allen Was Abusive |publisher= ABC News |date= February 5, 2014}}{{pb}}

Moses Farrow wrote an extensive blog post accusing Mia Farrow of emotionally abusing her children and driving some to suicide: "Most media sources claim my sister Tam died of 'heart failure' at the age of 21. In fact, Tam struggled with depression for much of her life, a situation exacerbated by my mother refusing to get her help, insisting that Tam was just 'moody.'
