'''Alternative energy''' is any energy source that is an alternative to [[fossil fuel]]. These alternatives are intended to address concerns about fossil fuels, such as its high [[carbon dioxide emissions]], an important factor in [[global warming]]. [[Marine energy]], [[hydroelectric power|hydroelectric]], [[wind power|wind]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]] and [[solar power]] are all alternative [[energy source|sources of energy]].

The nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has  changed considerably over time, as have controversies regarding energy use.  Because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as "alternative" is considered very controversial.&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|date=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|pages=1–169, 331–42|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal as an alternative to wood===
In the late [[medieval]] period, [[coal]] was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel, wood. The [[deforestation]] had resulted in shortage of wood, at that time soft coal appeared as a savior. Historian [[Norman F. Cantor]] describes how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 AD they were running short of wood for heating and cooking... By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster, [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of [[potatoes]] and [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Petroleum as an alternative to whale oil===
[[Whale oil]] was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century, but the [[History of whaling|depletion of the whale stocks]] by mid century caused whale oil prices to skyrocket setting the stage for the adoption of petroleum which was first commercialized in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuels===
{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
In 1917, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] advocated ethanol from corn, wheat and other foods as an alternative to coal and oil, stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels.  For Bell, the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Cellulosic ethanol]] can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks, and involves the use of the whole crop.  This new approach should increase yields and reduce the [[carbon footprint]] because the amount of energy-intensive fertilizers and fungicides will remain the same, for a higher output of usable material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5353118.stm Biofuels look to the next generation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cellu&gt;[http://www.eesi.org/021207_Cellulosic_Ethanol Cellulosic Ethanol: Not Just Any Liquid Fuel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023032408/http://www.eesi.org/021207_Cellulosic_Ethanol |date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, there are nine [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercial cellulosic ethanol plants]] which are either operating, or under construction, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grainnet.com/pdf/cellulosemap.pdf Building Cellulose]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal gasification as an alternative to petroleum===
In the 1970s, President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration advocated [[coal gasification]] as an alternative to expensive imported oil.  The program, including the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s. The carbon footprint and [[environmental impact of the coal industry|environmental impact of coal]] gasification are both very high.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Existing types of alternative energy==
* [[Hydro electricity]] captures energy from falling water.
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] uses nuclear fission to release energy stored in the atomic bonds of heavy elements.
* [[Wind energy]] is the generation of electricity from wind, commonly by using propeller-like turbines.
* [[Solar energy]] is the use of energy from the sun. Heat from the sun can be used for [[Solar_thermal_energy|solar thermal applications]] or light can be converted into electricity via photovoltaic devices.
* [[Geothermal energy]] is the use of the earth's internal heat to boil water for heating buildings or generating electricity.
* [[Biofuel]] and [[ethanol]] are plant-derived gasoline substitutes for powering vehicles.
* [[Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen]] can be used as a carrier of energy, produced by various technologies such as cracking of hydrocarbons or water electrolysis.

==Enabling technologies==

[[Ice storage air conditioning]] and [[Storage heater|thermal storage heaters]] are methods of shifting consumption to use low cost off-peak electricity.  When compared to resistance heating, [[heat pumps]]  conserve electrical power (or in rare cases mechanical or thermal power) by collecting heat from a cool source such as a body of water, the ground or the air.

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from diurnal to [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (e.g. through phase changes of a medium (i.e. changes from solid to liquid or vice versa), such as between water and slush or ice). Energy sources can be natural (via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (such as from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (such as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|Borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]].

==Renewable energy vs non-renewable energy==
{{Main|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy is generated from [[natural resource]]s—such as [[sunlight]],&lt;ref&gt;Including [[solar energy|solar]] and [[radiant energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]] and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]—which are renewable (naturally replenished).  When comparing the processes for producing energy, there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels.  The process of producing oil, coal, or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment, physical and chemical processes. On the other hand, alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and natural processes.  Wood, the most renewable and available alternative fuel, emits the same amount of carbon when burned as would be emitted if it degraded naturally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whichwoodburningstoves.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear power is an alternative to fossil fuels that is non-renewable, like fossil fuels, nuclear ones are a finite resource.

===Ecologically friendly alternatives===
A renewable energy source such as [[biomass]] is sometimes regarded as a good alternative to providing heat and electricity with fossil fuels. Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose, while burning biomass is carbon-neutral, air pollution is still produced. For example, the [[Netherlands]], once leader in use of [[palm oil]] as a biofuel, has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use "may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels".&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{Cite journal

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day, so, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; Germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts.&lt;ref name="zsw-bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zsw-bw2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft |date= May 5, 2010 |title= Storing green electricity as natural gas |publisher= ''fraunhofer.de'' |url= http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/04/green-electricity-storage-gas.html |accessdate= September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algae fuel===
[[Algae fuel]] is a [[biofuel]] which is derived from algae. During photosynthesis, algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass. This is usually done by placing the algae between two panes of glass.  The algae creates three forms of energy fuel: heat (from its growth cycle), biofuel (the natural "oil" derived from the algae), and biomass (from the algae itself, as it is harvested upon maturity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arup.com/Projects/SolarLeaf.aspx SolarLeaf - bioreactor facade], ARUP Creates First Algae Facade That Produces Energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat can be used to power building systems (such as heat process water) or to produce energy.  Biofuel is oil extracted from the algae upon maturity, and used to create energy similar to the use of [[biodiesel]]. The biomass is the matter left over after extracting the oil and water, and can be harvested to produce combustible methane for energy production, similar to the warmth felt in a compost pile or the methane collected from biodegradable materials in a landfill.  Additionally, the benefits of algae biofuel are that it can be produced industrially, as well as vertically (i.e. as a building facade), thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops (such as soy, palm, and canola).

===Biomass briquettes===
[[Biomass briquettes]] are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal.  The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70% the calorific value of charcoal.  There are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production. One exception is in North Kivu, in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to Mountain Gorilla habitat.  The staff of [[Virunga National Park]] have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes, thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park, and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas.

====Biogas digestion====
[[Biogas]] digestion harnesses the methane gas that is released when organic waste breaks down in an anaerobic environment. This gas can be retrieved from landfill sites or sewage systems. The gas can be used as a fuel for heat  or, more commonly, electricity generation.

The methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products.

===Biological hydrogen production===
Hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel; its only by-product is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hijikata | first1 = Tsuneo | year = 2001 | title = Research and Development of International Clean Energy Network Using Hydrogen Energy | url = | journal = [[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1016/s0360-3199(01)00089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure.&lt;ref&gt;P. 12, BMW Group Clean Energy ZEV Symposium, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

High Energy + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →  2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This requires a high-energy input, making commercial hydrogen very inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ghirardi ML|author2=Togasaki RK|author3=Seibert M |title=Oxygen Sensitivity of Algal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Production |journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume= 63-65|pages=141–51 |date=1997 |doi=10.1007/BF02920420 |pmid=18576077 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of a biological vector as a means to split water, and therefore produce hydrogen gas, would allow for the only energy input to be solar radiation. Biological vectors can include bacteria or more commonly algae.

Without the presence of oxygen, also known as an anaerobic environment, regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over. A major by-product of this process is hydrogen gas. If this could be implemented on a large scale, then sunlight, nutrients and water could create hydrogen gas to be used as a dense source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaffron H|author2= Rubin J |title=Fermentative and Photochemical Production of Hydrogen in Algae |journal=Journal of General Physiology |volume=26 |pages=219–240 |date=1942 |doi=10.1085/jgp.26.2.219 |pmid=19873339 |issue=2 |pmc=2142062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale production has proven difficult.

===Hydroelectricity===
{{main|Hydroelectricity}}
[[Hydroelectricity]] provided 75% of the worlds renewable electricity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx Historical Data Workbook (2013 calendar year)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622090917/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx |date=2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the electricity used today is a result of the heyday of conventional hydroelectric development between 1960 and 1980, which has virtually ceased in Europe and North America due to environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/world_commission_on_dams_final_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231146/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/world_commission_on_dams_final_report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally there is a trend towards more hydroelectricity. From 2004 to 2014 the installed capacity rose from 715 to 1,055 GW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf Renewables 2015. Global Status Report] Ren21, retrieved 20th January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular alternative to the large dams of the past is [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] where there is no water stored behind a dam and generation usually varies with seasonal rainfall. Using run-of-the-river in wet seasons and solar in dry seasons can balance seasonal variations for both. Another move away from large dams is [[small hydro]], these tend to be situated high up on tributaries, rather than on main rivers in valley bottoms.

===Offshore wind===
Offshore [[wind farms]] are similar to land-based wind farms, but are located on the ocean. Offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to {{convert|40|m}} deep, whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to {{convert|700|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=works&gt;{{Cite web

The advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean. Without any obstructions such as hills, trees and buildings, winds from the open ocean can reach up to speeds twice as fast as coastal areas.&lt;ref name=works/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Significant generation of [[offshore wind energy]] already contributes to electricity needs in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] and now the first offshore wind farms are under development in U.S. waters. While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades, especially in Europe, there is still uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the [[marine environment]].

Traditional offshore [[wind turbines]] are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the nearshore marine environment. As offshore wind technologies become more advanced, floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine and hydrokinetic energy===
Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) or [[marine energy]] development includes projects using the following devices:
* Wave power is the transport of energy by [[wind wave]]s, and the capture of that energy to do useful work – for example, [[electricity generation]] or [[pump]]ing water into reservoirs. A machine able to exploit significant waves in open coastal areas is generally known as a [[Wave energy|wave energy converter]].
* [[Tidal power]] turbines are placed in coastal and estuarine areas and daily flows are quite predictable.
* In-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers
* Ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents
* Ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

===Nuclear power===
In the year 2015 ten new reactors came online and 67 more were under construction including the first eight new  Generation III+ [[AP1000]] reactors in the US and China and the first four new Generation III [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] reactors in Finland, France and China.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/ten-new-nuclear-power-reactors-connected-to-grid-in-2015-highest-number-since-1990&lt;/ref&gt; Reactors are also under construction in Belarus, Brazil, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates.

==Investing in alternative energy==
As an emerging economic sector, there are limited stock market investment opportunities in alternative energy available to the general public. The public can buy shares of alternative energy companies from various stock markets, with wildly volatile returns. The recent IPO of SolarCity demonstrates the nascent nature of this sector- within a few weeks, it already had achieved the second highest market cap within the alternative energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://news.investors.com/technology/121412-637156-solarcity-market-cap-puts-it-after-first-solar.htm|title= SolarCity Stock Market Cap Makes It No. 2 Solar Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors can also choose to invest in ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that track an alternative energy index, such as the WilderHill New Energy Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nexindex.com/|title= WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are a number of mutual funds, such as Calvert's Global Alternative Energy Mutual Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.calvert.com/fundprofile.html?fund=971|title= Calvert Global Alternative Energy Fund (CGAEX)|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141106123856/http://www.calvert.com/fundProfile.html?fund=971|archivedate= 2014-11-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   that are a bit more proactive in choosing the selected investments.

Recently, [[Mosaic Inc.]] launched an online platform allowing residents of California and New York to invest directly in solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gigaom.com/2013/01/08/solar-mosaic-fully-crowd-funds-its-new-solar-projects-in-less-than-24-hours/|title=  Solar Mosaic fully crowd funds its new solar projects in less than 24 hours}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investing in solar projects had previously been limited to accredited investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2013/01/08/new-ways-to-invest-in-solar-like-buffett/|title= New Ways to Invest in Solar Like Buffett | work=Forbes | first=Tom|last=Konrad|date=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a small number of willing banks.

Over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy companies have been very volatile, with some 2007 returns in excess of 100%, some 2008 returns down 90% or more, and peak-to-trough returns in 2009 again over 100%.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In general there are three sub-segments of "alternative" energy investment:  solar energy, wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles. Alternative energy sources which are renewable and have lower carbon emissions than fossil fuels are hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and bio fuels. Each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns.

For example, photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly, benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry (i.e., driven by larger scale, higher module efficiency, and improving processing technologies). PV solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next five years. Better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronicdesign.com/article/power/is-solar-energy-really-ready-to-rumble-19153.aspx{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economics of solar PV electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials (e.g., First Solar) are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In addition, because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market (e.g., Q-Cells), this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules, which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment.

In contrast, because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years, its underlying technology is relatively stable.  Its economics are largely determined by siting (e.g., how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements) and the prices of steel (the largest component of a wind turbine) and select composites (used for the blades).  Because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high, logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage.  These issues and others were explored in a research report by Sanford Bernstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Alternative energy in transportation===
Due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the US national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above $4.00 at one point,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/02/news/economy/gas/?postversion=2008070206 Gas Prices post third straight record, CNN Money]&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s for consumers. In response, many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles. [[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid]] and [[battery electric vehicle]]s are commercially available and are gaining wider industry and consumer acceptance worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

For example, Nissan USA introduced the world's first mass-production electric vehicle, the [[Nissan Leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213055132/http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index#/leaf-electric-car/index |archive-date=2011-12-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plug-in hybrid car, the [[Chevrolet Volt]] also has been produced, using an electric motor to drive the wheels, and a small four-cylinder engine to generate additional electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html|title=  Transform Your Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making alternative energy mainstream==
Before alternative energy becomes mainstream there are a few crucial obstacles that it must overcome. First there must be increased understanding of how alternative energies are beneficial; secondly the availability components for these systems must increase; and lastly the pay-back period must be decreased.

For example, [[electric vehicle]]s (EV) and [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEV) are on the rise. The continue adoption of these vehicles depend on investment in public charging infrastructure, as well as implementing much more alternative energy for future transportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.sia-partners.com/20160927/public-charging-infrastructures-essential-mass-adoption-electric-vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 | author = S.C.E. Jupe | author2 = A. Michiorri | author3 = P.C. Taylor | doi=10.5772/7379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on alternative energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), both of which are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and supported by various corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/redmesa/|title=Defense-scale supercomputing comes to alternative energy research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|title=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170422/http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NREL has a budget of $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;*Chakrabarty, Gargi, April 16th, 2009. "Stimulus leaves NREL in cold" ''Denver Post"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing consumption levels of energy, it is projected that the levels would increase by 21% in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). (2016). Renewable Energy Benefits: Measuring the Economics. Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the renewables was relatively cheaper at $2.5m/MW as compared to the non-renewables &amp; 2.7m/MW.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, M.Z. Delucch, M.A. Bauer, Z.A. (2017, April 7). 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight (WWS) All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World. Atmosphere/Energy Program, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University. pg 1-12
&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the use of renewable energy is a cost effective method of obtaining energy. Additionally, their use also dispenses with the trade-off that has existed between environmental conservation and economic growth.

=== Mechanical energy ===
Mechanical energy associated with human activities such as blood circulation, respiration, walking, typing and running, is ubiquitous but usually wasted. It has attracted tremendous attention from researchers around the globe to find methods to scavenge such mechanical energies. The best solution currently is to use piezoelectric materials, which can generate flow of electrons when deformed. Various devices using piezoelectric materials have been built to scavenge mechanical energy. Considering that the piezoelectric constant of the material plays a critical role in the overall performance of a piezoelectric device, one critical research direction to improve device efficiency is to find new material of large piezoelectric response. Lead Magnesium Niobate-Lead Titanate (PMN-PT) is a next-generation piezoelectric material with super high piezoelectric constant when ideal composition and orientation are obtained. In 2012, PMN-PT Nanowires with a very high piezoelectric constant were fabricated by a hydro-thermal approach&lt;sup&gt;[[Nanogenerator|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and then assembled into an energy-harvesting device&lt;sup&gt;[[Nanogenerator|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. The record-high piezoelectric constant was further improved by the fabrication of a single-crystal PMN-PT nanobelt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fan|last2=Cai|first2=Wei|last3=Yeh|first3=Yao-Wen|last4=Xu|first4=Shiyou|last5=Yao|first5=Nan|date=2016-03-01|title=Energy scavenging based on a single-crystal PMN-PT nanobelt|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22513|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep22513|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4772540|pmid=26928788|pages=22513|bibcode=2016NatSR...622513W}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then used as the essential building block for a piezoelectric nanogenerator.

===Solar===
{{Main|Solar energy}}
[[File:Solar One Power Plant 1993 California.jpg|thumb]]
[[Solar energy]] can be used for [[Solar thermal energy|heating]], [[Solar air conditioning|cooling]] or electrical power generation using the sun.

Solar heat has long been employed in [[Passive solar building design|passively]] and [[Active solar heating|actively]] heated buildings, as well as district heating systems. Examples of the latter are the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] is Alberta, Canada, and numerous district systems in Denmark&lt;ref&gt;Holm L. (2012).

Presentation. European Sustainable Energy Week, Brussels. 18–22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there are two programs for the application of solar heat: the Solar District Heating (SDH)&lt;ref&gt;Solar District Heating (SDH) platform [http://www.solar-district-heating.eu website]. Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Energy Agency]]'s Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) program.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Heating and Cooling programme, of the International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles preventing the large-scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology and the cost. Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 16% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/bitstream/handle/10361/732/Solar%20Photovaltic%20Cell%20application.pdf?sequence=1|title=Improvement of efficiency for solar photovoltaic cell application|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=BRAC University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_12151611|title= Stimulus leaves NREL in cold|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Denver Post|first=Gargi|last=Chakrabarty}}&lt;/ref&gt; and develops research projects in the areas of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/solar/|title=Solar Research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for Sandia's solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory's $2.4 billion budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=2727 |title=Photovoltaics|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at [[University of North Carolina]] (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing a cost-effective solar technology. In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining. The Zhangebei National Wind and Solar Energy Storage and Transmission Demonstration Project northwest of Beijing, uses batteries to store 71 MWh, integrating wind and solar energy on the grid with frequency and voltage regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/155|title=DOE Global Energy Storage Database|website=www.energystorageexchange.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation [[Siemens]], announced that they had developed the world's most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/breakthrough-worlds-most-efficient-solar-panel/12800 |title=Breakthrough: World's most efficient solar panel|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=SmartPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind===

{{Main|Wind power}}

Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when [[NASA]] developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/technologies/wind_turbines.html |title=Wind energy research reaps rewards|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have programs dedicated to wind research. Sandia's laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials, aerodynamics, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=344 |title=Wind energy |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production, reducing their capital costs, and making wind energy more cost effective overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrel.gov/wind |title=Wind research|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) at [[Caltech]] was established to research alternative approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost, size, and environmental impact of wind energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|title=Wind resource evaluation at the Caltech Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE)|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Caltech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030309/http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal combined, supplied 1.3% of global final energy consumption in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721013559/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-21 }} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass can be regarded as "[[Biomaterial|biological material]]"&lt;ref&gt;In many context the term "biomaterial" refers specifically to the body-friendly materials in medical implantation, etc.; here it is used literally.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center]. Biomassenergycentre.org.uk. Retrieved on 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical'' methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; examples include forest residues (such as dead trees, branches and [[tree stump]]s), yard clippings, wood chips and even [[municipal solid waste]]. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], including [[biofuel]]s. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including [[miscanthus]], [[switchgrass]], [[hemp]], [[maize|corn]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]], [[sorghum]], [[sugarcane]], [[bamboo]],&lt;ref&gt;

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from this combustion.

===Ethanol biofuels===

{{Main|Ethanol biofuels}}

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. On the Federal level, the [[USDA]] conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other biofuels===

{{Main|Biofuel}}

From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol.

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture— unlike food crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | date = 2010| pages = 732–742 | author = B.N.

===Geothermal===

{{Main|Geothermal electricity}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is produced by tapping into the heat within the earths crust. It is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Geothermal Sustainability| journal = GHC Bulletin | date = 2007| pages = 2–6 | author = L. Ryback}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NREL |url=http://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/ |title=Geothermal Technologies|publisher=NREL | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sandia National Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandia|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/index.php?page_id=381|title=Geothermal |publisher=Sandia | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy. The International Centre for Geothermal Research (IGC), a German geosciences research organization, is largely focused on geothermal energy development research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam |url=http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struktur/GeoEngineering-Zentren/Internationales+Geothermiezentrum;jsessionid=8F6BF49D51E1BAA8273B58EAEEA40F41|title= International Centre for Geothermal Research |publisher=GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generation of alternative energy on the scale needed to replace fossil energy, in an effort to reverse global climate change, is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. For example, [[biomass energy]] generation would have to increase 7-fold to supply current primary energy demand, and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], "Challenge #1: Serious Environmental Impacts of Large-scale Renewable Generation", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, pp. 125-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans already appropriate 30 to 40% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide, indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems, in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rojstaczer | first1 = S. | last2 = Sterling | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Moore | first3 = N.J. | date = 2001 | title = Human appropriation of photosynthesis products | journal = Science | volume = 294 | pages = 2549–2552 | doi=10.1126/science.1064375| bibcode = 2001Sci...294.2549R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vitousek | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Ehrlich | first3 = A.H. | last4 = Matson | first4 = P.A. | date = 1986 | title = Human appropriation of the products of photosynthesis | journal = BioScience | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 368–373 | doi=10.2307/1310258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the United States each year is around 58 quads (61.5 EJ), about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products. The remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimentel | first1 = D. | display-authors = etal  | date = 1994 | title = Achieving a secure energy future: environmental and economic issues | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 9 | pages = 201–219 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since annual energy use in the United States is ca. 100 quads, biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction. To supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10% of the Earth's land surface, which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture (i.e., ca. 1500 million hectares), indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict, given current world hunger statistics, over growing plants for biofuel versus food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoffert | first1 = M.I. | display-authors = etal  | date = 2002 | title = Advanced technology paths to global climate change stability: energy for a greenhouse planet | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 981–987 | doi=10.1126/science.1072357 | pmid=12411695| bibcode = 2002Sci...298..981H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakicenovic, N., A. Gruebler, and A. McDonald (1998). ''Global Energy Perspective'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Given environmental concerns (e.g., fish migration, destruction of sensitive aquatic ecosystems, etc.) about building new dams to capture hydroelectric energy, further expansion of conventional [[hydropower in the United States]] is unlikely. Windpower, if deployed on the large scale necessary to substitute fossil energy, is likely to face public resistance. If 100% of U.S. energy demand were to be supplied by wind power, about 80 million hectares (i.e., more than 40% of all available farmland in the United States) would have to be covered with wind turbines (50m hub height and 250 to 500 m apart).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D.L., L.L. Wendell, and G.L. Gower (1992), "Wind energy potential in the United States considering environmental and land use exclusions", In: Proceedings of the Biennial Congress of the International Solar Energy Society – Solar World Congress in Denver, Colorado, edited by M.E. Ardan, S.M.A. Burley, and M. Coleman, Pergamon, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore not surprising that the major [[environmental impact of wind power]] is related to land use and less to wildlife (birds, bats, etc.) mortality. Unless only a relatively small fraction of electricity is generated by wind turbines in remote locations, it is unlikely that the public will tolerate large windfarms given concerns about blade noise and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D., (1997). ''Energy, Society, and Environment – Technology for a Sustainable Future'', Chapter 11, "Case Study: Public Reaction of UK Windfarms", Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wuestenhagen | first1 = R. | last2 = Welsink | first2 = M. | last3 = Buerer | first3 = M.J. | date = 2007 | title = Social acceptance of renewable energy innovations – an introduction to the concept | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 35 | pages = 2683–2691 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to net greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
{{original research|date=March 2017}}
Renewable alternative forms of energy have faced opposition from multiple groups, including conservatives and liberals. Around twelve states have passed proposals written to inhibit the alternative energy movement. Kansas lawmakers struck down a bill to phase out renewable energy mandates but face the possibility of the bill reappearing.&lt;ref name="A Pushback on Green Power"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardwell|first1=Diane|title=A Pushback on Green Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/business/energy-environment/a-pushback-on-green-power.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition cites the potentially high cost of branching out to these alternatives in order to support the continuation and reliance on fossil fuels. Ohio's mandate to phase in alternative energy faces opposition who believe higher electricity prices will result, while supporters fear the loss of economic development and jobs that alternative energy could bring.&lt;ref name="A Pushback on Green Power"/&gt;

With nuclear meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear power presents a constant danger and is more unlikely to be a popular alternative source.  The costs of maintaining nuclear facilities, the potential risk of meltdowns, and the cost of cleaning up meltdowns are cited as reasons behind the movement away from the use of nuclear energy.  In some countries nuclear power plants cannot compete with fossil fuels currently due to the latter's lower price and availability. Nuclear power plants also face competition from the increasing renewable energy subsidies.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Eduardo|title=How Renewable Energy is Blowing Climate Change Efforts off Course|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/business/energy-environment/how-renewable-energy-is-blowing-climate-change-efforts-off-course.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar panels are an icon of the 'green power' movement, however the process of manufacturing the quartz based panels can be detrimental to the environment. Raw quartz (silica) is used to create solar cells must be mined using harsh chemicals that harm the surrounding environment, as well as those working in the mines. Silicosis is a form of lung disease that is caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust resulting in nodule lesions in the lungs. The silica must be cultivated into metallurgical-grade silicon, the process requiring a massive amount of energy as the quartz is placed into electric arc furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Silicon.html|title=Silicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metallurgical grade silica must be processed into polysilicon. This process also produces tetrachloride, a toxic substance that, if not disposed of correctly, can be harmful to the surrounding environment. Hydrochloric acid is formed when tetrachloride interacts with water, lowering water and soil pH. Incidents of tetrachloride spills are common in China, as the production of solar panels has shifted from Europe and the United States to Asian countries within the early 2000s. Because of such, the villagers of Gaolong are unable to leave their homes due to air and soil becoming toxic. This was due to Luoyang Zhongui High-Technology Co. repeatedly dumped tetrachloride in a nearby field for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html|title=Solar Energy Firms Leave Waste Behind in China|last=Eunjung Cha|first=Ariana|date=March 9, 2008|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bio fireplace''' (also on '''bio-ethanol fireplace''', '''ethanol fireplace''') is a type of fireplace or furnace with combined zones generation of heat and technological process – combustion of fuel (denatured [[alcohol]]). This fireplace can be installed without a [[chimney]] and gives the real flame, not imitation. The main part of each bio fireplace is the burner. The burner is a metal container with various shape and [[dimensions]]. The [[Gas burner|burner]] is filled with fuel, usually it is [[bioethanol]]. Fuel is poured into the burner and lit with an extended candle lighter as suggested. Bio fireplaces should be operated with care, since bioethanol is highly flammable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kraemer|first1=R|last2=Knobloch|first2=K|last3=Lorenzen|first3=J|last4=Breuing|first4=K.

== Types ==

Ethanol fireplaces are available in several different designs.There are manual ethanol fireplaces and automatic ethanol fireplaces. Automatic ethanol fireplace flames have no direct contact with fuel.  Fuel is in stored in a reservoir and then heated until the alcohol vapors evaporate into the burner. These vapors are then ignited by a spark system in the unit. User can turn the flames on or off as well as regulate the flame size with a remote control, mobile app or smart home system. A microprocessor controls burning process, using numerous sensors to keep burning parameters stable. If the sensors detect any issues- such as an earth quake, low oxygen or excessively high temperatures- they will extinguish the flame. Wall mounted designs can be built into a [[drywall]] wall or be recessed into the wall. Free standing or stand alone ethanol fireplaces are portable, and can be used in any architectural setting. Table top ethanol fireplaces are the smallest versions of ethanol fireplaces and are often used as a decoration.

'''Bubble fusion''' is the non-technical name for a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction hypothesized to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created in a liquid during [[Sonic cavitation|acoustic cavitation]]. The more technical name is '''sonofusion'''.&lt;ref name="Chang-practical"&gt;{{cite news

The term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan]] and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.

Eventually, an investigation by [[Purdue University]] found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the [[Office of Naval Research]] reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.&lt;ref name=reich /&gt;

In the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|Rusi P. Taleyarkhan]] and colleagues at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]] reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with [[Deuterium|deuterated]] [[acetone]] ({{carbon|3}}{{deuterium|6}}{{oxygen}}) showed measurements of [[tritium]] and [[neutron]] output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the [[sonoluminescence]] pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.&lt;ref name="Taleyarkhan-2002-03-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taleyarkhan|first=R.

== Oak Ridge failed replication ==
The results were so startling, that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated [[neutron detection]] equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence.&lt;ref name="Shapira-2002-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan ''et al.'', when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubble Fusion takes next hurdle|author=Haiko Lietz|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/20/20542/1.html|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal ''Science''&lt;ref name="Galonsky-2002-09-06"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
expressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky's opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a [[deuterium]]-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed  counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was "reasonably close" to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.

In February 2005 the documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174400/http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}, Seth Putterman personal page.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]], to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.

In July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan's students at [[Purdue University]] published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report, no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It concluded in 2008 that Taleyarkhan's name should have appeared in the author list because of his deep involvement in many steps of the research, that he added one author that had not really participated in the paper just to overcome the criticism of one reviewer, and that this was part of an attempt of "an effort to falsify the scientific record by assertion of independent confirmation". The investigation did not address the validity of the experimental results.&lt;ref name="report2008"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of [[LeTourneau University]] presented two papers at the [[American Nuclear Society]] Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, [[deuterated benzene]], [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[uranyl nitrate]]. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of [[Neutron detection|neutron detectors]]. They claimed a liquid [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detector measured neutron levels at 8 [[standard deviation]]s above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated [[Experimental control|control]] liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid.&lt;ref name="LeTourneau-2006-11-17"&gt;"Bubble Fusion Confirmed by LETU Research" LeTourneau University News (www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/events/Bubble_Fusion_Confirmed_by_LETU_Research.html) link inactive as of 2008-05-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANS-pgm"&gt;{{cite web

Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 ''Nature'' report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he didn't give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they shouldn't publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as "peer-reviewed" and "independent", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan's colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.&lt;ref name="silencing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hot air"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal ''Nuclear Engineering and Design'' was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan's knowledge.&lt;ref name="hot air"/&gt;

In 2002 Taleyarkhan  filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. ''Nature'' reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited [[cold fusion]], found that there was "no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated", and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.&lt;ref name="hot air_2"&gt;{{cite journal

== Doubts prompt investigation ==
Doubts among Purdue University's Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research. In a March 9, 2006 article entitled "Evidence for bubble fusion called into question", ''Nature'' interviewed several of Taleyarkhan's colleagues who suspected something was amiss.&lt;ref name="Reich-2006-03-09"&gt;{{cite journal

On February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that "the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted". Their report also stated that "vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward."&lt;ref name="Purdue-2007-02-07"&gt;{{cite news

In June 2008, a multi-institutional team including Taleyarkhan published a paper in Nuclear Engineering and Design to "clear up misconceptions generated by a webposting of UCLA which served as the basis for the ''Nature'' article of March 2006", according to a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan.  It concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as "independent" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague's name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research ("the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to overcome a reviewer's criticism", the report concluded).&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleyarkhan's appeal of the report's conclusions was rejected.  He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that "all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground".&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Despite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]  between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.&lt;ref name=reich&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Reich, Eugenie Samuel |title= Bubble-fusion scientist debarred from federal funding |magazine=[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] |date= 23 November 2009 |doi= 10.1038/news.2009.1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cat's cradle''' is one of the oldest games in recorded human history, and involves creating various [[string figure]]s, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. The true origin of the name is debated, though the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/87650.html|title='Cat's Cradle' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of string, the specific figures, their order, and the names of the figures vary. Independent versions of this game have been found in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures throughout the world, including in Africa, Eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, Australia, the Americas, and the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cats-cradle_us_5a3bcd4ae4b0df0de8b062f5|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Zgheib|first=Yara|date=2017-12-21|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://si-siris.blogspot.com/2010/05/cats-cradle.html|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Archives|first=National Anthropological|date=2010-05-13|website=Smithsonian Collections Blog|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
[[File:Eishosai Choki - Cat's Cradle.jpg|thumb|''The lovers, Okiku and Yosuke, play cat’s cradle'', by [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (1804)]]

The game consists of two or more players making a sequence of string figures, each altering the figure made by the previous player. The game begins with one player making the eponymous figure ''Cat's Cradle'' (above). After each figure, the next player manipulates that figure and removes the string figure from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop to create another figure, for example, ''Diamonds''. ''Diamonds'' might then lead to ''Candles'', for example, and then ''Manger''—an inverted ''Cat's Cradle''—and so on. Most of the core figures allow a choice between two or more subsequent figures: for example, ''Fish in a Dish'' can become ''Cat's Eye'' or ''Manger''. The game ends when a player makes a mistake or creates a dead-end figure, such as ''Two Crowns'', which cannot be turned into anything else.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camilla Gryski|Gryski, Camilla]] (1984). ''Cat's Cradle, Owl's Eyes: A Book of String Games''. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0688039413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also may be played solo, as is done in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Gryski, Camilla (1985). ''Many Stars &amp; More String Games'', pp. 66–72. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0-688-05792-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mma two young women seated by a kotatsu playing cats cradle 55802.jpg|thumb|"Two Young Women Seated by a [[Kotatsu]] Playing Cat's Cradle", [[Suzuki Harunobu]], ca. 1765]]

The origin of the name "cat's cradle" is debated but the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"An ingenious play they call cat's cradle; one ties the two ends of a packthread together, and then winds it about his fingers, another with both hands takes it off perhaps in the shape of a gridiron, the first takes it from him again in another form, and so on alternately changing the packthread into a multitude of figures whose names I forget, it being so many years since I played at it myself."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The name may have come from a corruption of cratch-cradle, or [[manger]] [[bassinet|cradle]]{{#tag:ref|"Nares, under Cratche, an archaic word for manger, deems it to be the origin of the name of this game, which, however, he calls ''scratch-cradle''. But it clearly, he says, meant originally ''cratch-cradle,'' the manger which held the Holy Infant as a cradle..."&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, E.S. "Cats-Cradle", pp.&amp;nbsp;412–422 of ''Notes and Queries: A Medium of Inter-communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, Etc.'', pp. 421–422, Vol. 11 (January&amp;mdash;June, 1855). London: George Bell (1855).&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref|"This opens to us the meaning of a childish game, corruptly called ''scratch-cradle,'' which consists in winding a packthread double round the hands, into a rude representation of a manger, which is taken off by the other player on his hands, so as to assume a new form, and thus alternately for several times, always changing the appearance. The art consists in making the right changes. But it clearly meant originally the ''cratch-cradle;'' the manger that held the Holy Infant as a cradle."&lt;ref name="Nares"&gt;Nares, Robert.

London: Gibbings and Company, Limited (1901).&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} (although this derivation is disputed by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]). The connection between the two words, ''cratches'' and ''cradle'', may come from the [[Christian]] [[Nativity of Jesus|story of the birth of Jesus]], in which a manger is used as a cradle.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nares" /&gt;

In an 1858 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.john-leech-archive.org.uk/1858/snowed-up.htm Snowed Up]", ''John-Leech-Archive.org.UK''.&lt;/ref&gt; it is referred to as "scratch cradle", a name supported by [[E. Cobham Brewer|Brewer]]'s 1898 ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bartleby.com/81/15032.html Scratch Cradle]", ''Bartleby.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; As "Cat's cradle" often is used to refer to string figures and games in general, Jayne uses "Real Cat's-Cradle" to refer to the specific game.&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/stringfiguresstu00jaynuoft#page/n9/mode/2up|author=Jayne, C.

Different [[culture]]s have different names for the game, and often different names for the individual figures. The [[French language|French]] word for manger is ''crèche'', and cattle feed racks are still known as ''cratches''. In [[Russia]] the whole game is called simply, ''the game of string'', and the ''diamonds'' pattern is called ''carpet'', with other pattern names such as ''field'', ''fish'', and ''sawhorse'' for the other figures—a ''cat'' isn't mentioned.&lt;ref name="B&amp;P"&gt;Buchanan, Andrea J. and Peskowitz, Miriam (2007). ''The Daring Book for Girls'', p.277. {{ISBN|978-0-06-147257-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The game may have originated in China.&lt;ref&gt;(1989). ''Anthroquest: the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation news'', Issues 39–46, p.17. The Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]] the game is called ''fan sheng'' ({{lang-en|well rope}}),&lt;ref name="Jay"/&gt; or catch cradle.&lt;ref name="B&amp;P"/&gt; In some regions of the [[United States|U.S.]], this game also is known as ''Jack in the Pulpit''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John P.

In principle any fuel that can be vapourised and pre-mixed with air can be used. "Ultra vaporized steam" replaces the exploding air/fuel mixture as the work medium.&lt;ref name=adap/&gt; The flameless combustion keeps emissions of  [[hydrocarbons]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[nitrous oxide]]s extremely low.

A [[Steam car#Enginion Steamcell|ceramic heat cell made by German firm Enginion]] is claimed to  generate up to 30&amp;nbsp;megawatts of power per cubic meter, operating at a moderate temperature of 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, with output varying from 5% to 100% of this, responding in 5 milliseconds. Emissions are claimed to be well below 10 parts per million even without [[exhaust gas recirculation]]. A glow plug is used to start the cell.&lt;ref name=adap/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==
[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]
{| class=wikitable align=right
|+ The [[tetromino]]s S and Z are enantiomorphs in 2-dimensions
![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]&lt;BR&gt;S
![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition of chirality.

Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9774">'''Color superconductivity''' is a phenomenon predicted to occur in [[QCD matter|quark matter]] if the [[baryon]] density is sufficiently high (well above nuclear density) and the temperature is not too high (well below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin). Color superconducting phases are to be contrasted with the normal phase of quark matter, which is just a weakly interacting [[Fermi liquid]] of quarks.

In theoretical terms, a color superconducting phase is a state in which the quarks near the [[Fermi surface]] become correlated in [[Cooper pairs]], which condense. In phenomenological terms, a color superconducting phase breaks some of the symmetries of the underlying theory, and has a very different spectrum of excitations and very different transport properties from the normal phase.

== Description ==

=== Analogy with superconducting metals ===
It is well known that at low temperature many metals become [[superconductor]]s. A metal can be viewed as a [[Fermi liquid]] of electrons, and below a critical temperature, an attractive [[phonon]]-mediated interaction between the electrons near the Fermi surface causes them to pair up and form a condensate of Cooper pairs, which via the [[Higgs mechanism|Anderson-Higgs mechanism]] makes the [[photon]] massive, leading to the characteristic behaviors of a superconductor; infinite conductivity and the exclusion of magnetic fields ([[Meissner effect]]). The crucial ingredients for this to occur are:
# a liquid of charged fermions.
# an attractive interaction between the fermions
# low temperature (below the critical temperature)
These ingredients are also present in sufficiently dense quark matter, leading physicists to expect that something similar will happen in that context:
# quarks carry both electric charge and [[color charge]];
# the [[strong interaction]] between two quarks is powerfully attractive;
# the critical temperature is expected to be given by the QCD scale, which is of order 100 MeV, or 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin, the temperature of the universe a few minutes after the [[big bang]], so quark matter that we may currently observe in compact stars or other natural settings will be below this temperature.

The fact that a Cooper pair of quarks carries a net color charge, as well as a net electric charge, means that some of the [[gluons]] (which mediate the strong interaction just as photons mediate electromagnetism) become massive in a phase with a condensate of quark Cooper pairs, so such a phase is called a "color superconductor". Actually, in many color superconducting phases the photon itself does not become massive, but mixes with one of the gluons to yield a new massless "rotated photon". This is an MeV-scale echo of the mixing of the [[hypercharge]] and W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bosons that originally yielded the photon at the TeV scale of electroweak symmetry breaking.

=== Diversity of color superconducting phases ===
Unlike an electrical superconductor, color-superconducting quark matter comes in many varieties, each of which is a separate phase of matter. This is because quarks, unlike electrons, come in many species.  There are three different colors (red, green, blue) and in the core of a compact star we expect three different flavors (up, down, strange), making nine species in all. Thus in forming the Cooper pairs there is a &lt;!--&lt;math&gt;9\times 9&lt;/math&gt;--&gt; 9×9 color-flavor matrix of possible pairing patterns. The differences between these patterns are very physically significant: different patterns break different symmetries of the underlying theory, leading to different excitation spectra and different transport properties.

It is very hard to predict which pairing patterns will be favored in nature. In principle this question could be decided by a QCD calculation, since QCD is the theory that fully describes the strong interaction. In the limit of infinite density, where the strong interaction becomes weak because of [[asymptotic freedom]], controlled calculations can be performed, and it is known that the favored phase in three-flavor quark matter is the ''[[color-flavor locking|color-flavor-locked]]'' phase. But at the densities that exist in nature these calculations are unreliable, and the only known alternative is the brute-force computational approach of [[lattice QCD]], which unfortunately has a technical difficulty (the "[[sign problem]]") that renders it useless for calculations at high quark density and low temperature.

Physicists are currently pursuing the following lines of research on color superconductivity:
* Performing calculations in the infinite density limit, to get some idea of the behavior at one edge of the phase diagram.
* Performing calculations of the phase structure down to medium density using a highly simplified model of QCD, the [[Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model|Nambu-Jona-Lasinio]] (NJL) model, which is not a controlled approximation, but is expected to yield semi-quantitative insights.
* Writing down an effective theory for the excitations of a given phase, and using it to calculate the physical properties of that phase.
* Performing astrophysical calculations, using NJL models or effective theories, to see if there are observable signatures by which one could confirm or rule out the presence of specific color superconducting phases in nature (i.e. in compact stars: see next section).

== Possible occurrence in nature ==
The only known place in the universe where the baryon density might possibly be high enough to produce quark matter, and the temperature is low enough for color superconductivity to occur, is the core of a [[compact star]] (often called a "[[neutron star]]", a term which prejudges the question of its actual makeup). There are many open questions here:
* We do not know the critical density at which there would be a phase transition from nuclear matter to some form of quark matter, so we do not know whether compact stars have quark matter cores or not.
* On the other extreme, it is conceivable that nuclear matter in bulk is actually metastable, and decays into quark matter (the "stable [[strange matter]] hypothesis"). In this case, compact stars would consist completely of quark matter all the way to their surface.
* Assuming that compact stars do contain quark matter, we do not know whether that quark matter is in a color superconducting phase or not. At infinite density one expects color superconductivity, and the attractive nature of the dominant strong quark-quark interaction leads one to expect that it will survive down to lower densities, but there may be a transition to some strongly coupled phase (e.g. a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of spatially bound di- or [[hexaquark]]s).

'''Armor''' has been used in the military for a long period of time during the course of history, but is becoming more frequently seen in the public sector as time passes. There are many different forms and ways that armor is being commercially used throughout the world today. The most popular and well-known uses are body and vehicle armor. There are other commercial uses including aircraft armor and armored glass.

==Armor technologies==

===Aramids===
[[Aramid|Aramid fiber]] is the generic name of a group of synthetic fibers which are used in vehicle armor, fire equipment, tires, and bulletproof vests. The material has extremely high strength while still being flexible, and is very resistant to heat (it does not melt). In 2011 worldwide production of aramids was more than 60,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Todd. Aramid Fibers
The Versatile Polymer Reinforcing Fiber. Retrieved from http://composite.about.com/od/aboutaramids/a/Aramid-Fibers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Para aramids====
The Para-aramid with the most production worldwide is [[Kevlar]]. It was commerciality introduced by [[Du Pont]] in 1972. In 1998 Kevlar accounted for 85% of the global market of para-aramid fibers. Kevlar is the material most often used in bulletproof vests. Different forms of Kevlar are anywhere from five to twenty times stronger than steel per weight.&lt;ref&gt;(2001, April 30). Aramid Fibers. http://www.chem.uwec.edu/Chem405_s01/malenirf/project.html&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantages of Kevlar are that it degrades with exposure to UV light, is expensive to produce, and is difficult to shape.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, V. (2001). What is Kevlar? Types of Kevlar. Retrieved from http://www.technologystudent.com/joints/kevlar2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meta aramids====
Meta aramids are aramid compounds that have a different molecular structure, giving them different physical properties to para aramid fibers. The most popular product of this kind is [[Nomex]]. Nomex has less strength than Kevlar, but it has extremely high heat, flame, ultraviolet, chemical, and radiation resistance. Meta aramids are commonly found in firefighting equipment, as well as military pilot suits and helmets.

===Dragon Skin===
[[Dragon Skin]] armor uses multiple ceramic and titanium composite two-inch discs that overlap, forming an armor that looks like scales of a dragon. This type of structure allows the vests to stay relatively light and flexible. Dragon skin has two main benefits over other types of body armor: It can take multiple hits from bullets and it doesn’t compromise the entire structure, and it deals with the blunt force of a bullet or projectile much better than most other types of body armor because the impact energy of a bullet can disperse over a larger area. In a test, using 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm, 7.62mm, and 9mm steel core, armor-piercing ammunition, and with more than a dozen shots, the dragon skin armor remains completely intact and no bullet penetrated through.

===Spider Silk===
[[Spider silk]] has some amazing natural properties and is one of nature’s strongest materials. Spider’s dragline silk has a tensile strength (force by which it can be stretched without breaking) similar to alloy steel, or about half as strong as Kevlar. Weight for weight it is five times stronger than steel. One apparent difference between the other armor materials is that the silk can be stretched up to 5 times its relaxed length without breaking. [[Darwin's bark spider]] produces a silk that is more than 10 times tougher than Kevlar and is the toughest biological material ever studied.&lt;ref&gt;Agnarsson, Ingi. Kuntner, Matjaz. Blackledge, Todd A. (2010, September 16). Bioprospecting Finds the Toughest Biological Material: Extraordinary Silk from a Giant Rivine Orb Spider. Retrieved from http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011234&lt;/ref&gt; Spider’s silk elasticity and strength allow for unique applications compared to the aramid fibers, for example it could be used as a protective body armor that would allow for coverage of the entire head due to its flexibility. It has the potential to be used in numerous military, construction, and medical applications.

==Commercial and cargo planes==
Following the bombing of the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] in 1988 the Transportation Security Laboratories have been developing ways to reduce the damage to an airplane by placing a hardened film around the cargo bay and overhead compartments. They have also changed the shape of the cargo bay to provide more security and to reduce the force of any explosion. 
To improve the circumstances in a case where an aircraft turbine engine fails, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) is working to design specific armor to protect the vital parts of the plane to assure safe flying until landing is accomplished. This armored barrier would prevent fragments from engine failure from damaging other sections of the airplane. High strength polymer fibers have been found to be the most effective material for this specific use.&lt;ref&gt;Shockey, D. A., Giovanola, J. H., Simons, J. W., Erlich, D. C., Klopp, R. W., &amp; Skaggs, S. R. (1997). Advanced Armor Technology: Application Potential for Engine Fragment Barriers for Commercial Aircraft. Retrieved from http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/20000/20000/20076/PB98108418.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armored glass==
Armor Glass International, Inc. was founded by Michael Fjetland, BBA/JD, to "armor glass" under the trademark Armor Glass® to provide security from breach of the glass by natural disasters, explosions, burglars, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, golf balls or other harmful events. One of the main products offered by this company is security film. This type of film is 8 mil thick, is rated for a Large Missile Impact (Level C 4.5 lb.) and is placed on the inside of a window or other source of glass, the weakest link of every building, to create a more durable and defensive layer. Studies have shown that breach of a window by wind-borne debris hurled by hurricane-force winds is what leads to roof uplift and structural collapse. This protective film is used on many buildings in Washington D.C. such as the Pentagon, Smithsonian, Congress, etc. but is also used commercially throughout the world for any person or company striving for extra protection against specific unpredictable encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Armor Glass International. (2015). Armor Glass. Retrieved from http://www.armor-glass.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicle armor==
The average person who purchases an automobile according to the [[International Armoring Corporation]] fits into at least one of the three categories. They have money, believe there is a genuine threat against their lives, or are a government official.  Upon receiving a down payment by the client the armoring process begins. At the beginning of the process the company assigned with the project meets with the client. This meeting is to determine how the automobile should be customized to fit the client’s needs based on type of car, threat level, and defensive options. When determining type of car the customer has many options as any automobile can be armored. However, the weight of the armor can vary from 500 to 2000 pounds requiring special suspension and engines upgrades to be installed. After the car type is chosen the customer is asked about their perceived threat level. This helps the manufactures to determine what ballistic protection level the car needs customized for (See also, International Armoring Corporation). Ballistic protection levels range Type 1 to Type IV and are governed by [[National Institute of Justice]] Standard 0108.01.  Once the preliminary review is completed and the specifications are finalized the manufacture begin the project.&lt;ref&gt;Medlin, R. C. (1982). Lightweight armored vehicle and method of making same using woven polyester glass protective sheets. Retrieved from https://www.google.com/patents/US4352316?dq=Lightweight+armored+vehicle+patent+2010&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CZdVU4OJOI2uyASp4oHwBA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to patent US 4352316 A* there are several steps when it comes to armoring a civilian automobile. First, the automobile is stripped of its interior. Second, door frames are rebuilt to include armor plating and bullet proof windows are added. Third, the vertical portions, top, and bottom of the automobile are enforced with armoring plating. Finally, the car’s battery and engine are encased in armor plating.&lt;ref&gt;Kolwell, K.C. Car and Driver. (December 2009). How To: Bulletproof a Car Retrieved from http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-bulletproof-a-car-feature&lt;/ref&gt;   The objective of the plating is to prevent bullets from penetrating the automobile and entering into the passenger cabin. During the installation process various materials are used including; [[bulletproof glass]], [[ballistic nylon]], [[run flat]] inserts, and [[Lexan]]. Outside of the basic armoring package several defensive options are available to help improve the security of the automobile comprising; dual battery system, DVR security camera system, electric door handles, flashing front strobe lights, night vision systems, self-sealing fuel tank, and siren/loudspeaker system, etc.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Justice (December 1981) Ballistic Resistant Protective Material NIJ Standard 0108.01 Retrieved from: https://www.justnet.org/pdf/0108.01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==

===Economics of body armor===
The US body armor industry is worth $802 million  a year with a decrease just over nine percent in the last five years according to a market research done by [[IBISWorld]]. This is the result of the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of troops. There are currently around 80 companies in the US that are specializing in body armor from head to toe. The top four companies are said to control almost half of the market. The market is expected to come back from this 9% low due to needs for law enforcement and other private security firms. Just the body armor industry alone profits 39.3 million in profit. The military takes the majority with 72%, law enforcement take 14.2%, the commercial use has the remainder of the 13.8%.  The report states that the use of robots has reduced the need for body armor in highly dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (July 2013). Flesh Wounds: Military Withdrawal from Combat Zones Will Continue Hampering Growth. IBIS World Industry Report OD5952: Body Armor Manufacturing in the US. Available from www.ibisworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics of vehicle armor===
In a report done by Ibisworld.com commercial uses of vehicle armor only share an 8% of the 7.2 billion dollar industry. The market has been on a steady decline, 12% over the past five years and expected to drop another 2% over the next five years. 68% of the market is taken by the military and government. It profits just under 1 billion dollars a year. Exports of commercial armored vehicles are on the rise the majority of the exports go the United Arab Emirates about 29%. Most of the other majority are exported to the middle east.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, B. (December 2013). Uphill Battle: Despite Stable Foreign Demand, Low Government Spending Will Cut into Growth.

'''Contained earth''' (CE) is a structurally designed [[natural building material]] that combines containment, inexpensive reinforcement, and strongly cohesive [[earthen wall]]s. CE is [[earthbag construction]] that can be calibrated for several [[seismic risk]] levels based on building soil strength and plan standards for adequate bracing.

There is a recognized need for structural understanding of alternative building materials.&lt;ref&gt; Schildkamp, Martijn (2015) Outcome of Survey About Simplified Earthquake Research. SmartShelterResearch.com, 74% of almost 90 professional respondents to a 2015 survey expressed a need for structural information about alternative building materials&lt;/ref&gt; Construction guidelines for CE are currently under development, based on the New Zealand's performance-based code for adobe and rammed earth.&lt;ref&gt; Standards New Zealand (1998) 4299: Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE is differentiated from [[contained gravel]] (CG) or [[contained sand]] (CS) by the use of damp, tamped, cured cohesive fill. CE can be modular, built in [[poly-propylene]] [[rice bag]] material containers, or solid, built in mesh tubing that allows earthen fill to solidify between courses. 
[[File:Types of Contained Earth.jpg|thumb|Types of Contained Earth]]

CG, filled with [[pumice]] or ordinary [[gravel]] and/ or small stones, is often used as water-resistant base walls under CE, which also provides an effective [[capillary break]]. Soilbags used mostly in horizontal applications by [[civil engineer]]s contain loose fill which includes both CG and CS. CG courses, like soilbags, may contribute base isolation and/or vibration damping qualities,&lt;ref&gt; Liu, Sihong, Y. Wang, J. Gao, and Y. Jin (2011) [http:www.scientific.net/AMR.243-249.893 Cyclic Simple Shear Tests on Base Isolation Using Soilbags] Advanced Materials Research Vols. 243–249 pp 893–896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Yamamoto, Haruyuki and H. Cheng (2012) "Development Study on Device To Reduce Seismic Response by Using Soil-bags Assemblies," in Research, Development, and Practice in Structural Engineering and Construction, V. Singh and A. Yazdani (eds.), ASEA-Sec-1, Perth, 28 November – 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; although out-of-plane strength needs research. 

For clarity, earthbag built with a low cohesion fill, or filled with dry soil that does not solidify, is not CE but CS. Uncured CE also performs structurally like CS.

==Earthbag variations==
Builders used to working without engineers are proud of earthbag's unlimited variations. Few trainers discuss risk levels of building sites, or recommend accurate tests of soil strength, even though soil strength is a key factor of improved seismic performance for earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt; King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture&lt;/ref&gt; 

Need for or use of metal components are disputed, including [[rebar]] hammered into walls&lt;ref&gt; Geiger, Owen (2011) Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls Step-by-Step (ebook)&lt;/ref&gt; and barbed wire between courses, although static friction of smooth bag-to-bag surfaces of heavy modular CE walls is 0.4 with no adhesion.&lt;ref&gt; Pelly, Ralph (2009) Plastic Limit Analysis of Earthbag Structures. University of Bath (dissertation) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;   

Engineering knowledge of earthbag has been growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthbagbuilding.com/testing.htm Earthbag Testing Research Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; More is known about the performance of walls made with sand or dry or uncured soil than about the overwhelming majority of earthbag buildings which have used damp, cohesive soil fill. Reports based on tests of soilbags and loose or granular fill (or uncured fill) assumes that soil strength is less important to wall strength than bag fabric strength for.&lt;ref&gt; Canadell, Samuel, A. Blanco and S. Cavalero (2016) Comprehensive Design Method for Earthbag and Superadobe. Materials and Design 96 (2016) 270- 282&lt;/ref&gt; However, shear tests show clearly that stronger cured, cohesive fill increases contained earth wall strength substantially.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (May 2017) [https://buildsimple.org/resources/Estimated%20Shear%20Strengths%20CE%205-25-17.pdf Estimated Shear Strengths of Contained Earth Walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthbag for high risk environments==
Earthbag developed gradually without structural analysis, first for small domes,&lt;ref&gt; Hart, K. [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/history.htm History] EarthbagBuilding.com&lt;/ref&gt; then for vertical wall buildings of many shapes. Although domes passed structural testing in California, no structural information was extracted from tests of the inherently stable shapes.&lt;ref&gt; Khalili and Vittori&lt;/ref&gt; Builders borrowed guidelines for adobe to recommend plan details,&lt;ref&gt; Hunter, K. and D. Kiffmeyer (2004) Earthbag Building: Tools, Tricks and Techniques. New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island Canada&lt;/ref&gt; but code developed in low seismic risk New Mexico does not address issues for higher risk areas.&lt;ref&gt; New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department (2015)
[http://164.64.110.239/nmac/parts/title14/14.007.0004.htm 2015 New Mexico Earthen Building Code]&lt;/ref&gt; California's seismic risk levels are almost three times as high as New Mexico's,&lt;ref&gt; USGS (2014) [ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/web/nshm/conterminous/2014/2014_5Hz2pct.pdf Seismicity: Conterminous US 2% probability in 50 years map of 0.2 second spectral acceleration]&lt;/ref&gt; and risk worldwide rises much higher. 

Earthbag is often tried after disasters in the developing world, including Sri Lanka's [[2004 tsunami]]&lt;ref&gt;Earthbag housing: structural behaviour and applicability in Sri Lanka. Engineering Sustainability [serial online]. December 2011;164(4):261–273. Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, Haiti's [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/projects/haiti.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Nepal's [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt; Nepal Earthquake Clearinghouse (2015) [http://www.eqclearinghouse.org/2015-04-25-nepal/2015/06/08/performance-of-earthbag-schools/ Performance of Earthbag Schools]. Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE walls fail in [[shear test]]s when barbs flex or bend back or (with weak soil fill) by chipping cured bag fill. CS walls or uncured CE walls fail differently, by slitting bag fabric as barbs move through loose fill.

Because no earthbag buildings were seriously damaged by seismic motion up to 0.8 g in [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal's 2015 quakes]], [[Nepal's building code]] recognizes earthbag,&lt;ref&gt; Geiger,
 O. (7 April 2017) [http://www.naturalbuildingblog.com/earthbag-building-gains-code-approval-nepal/ Earthbag Building Gains Code Approval in Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; although the code does not discuss soil strengths or improved reinforcement. Nepal requires buildings to resist 1.5 g risk although hazard maps show higher values. Better trainers assume the use of cohesive soil and barbed wire, and recommend vertical rebar, buttresses, and bond beams,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.goodearthnepal.org/earthbag-technology/ Earthbag Technology] (website)&lt;/ref&gt; but rule of thumb earthbag techniques should be differentiated from contained earth that follows more complete guidelines.

==CE compared to New Zealand wall strengths==
Earthquake damage results confirm the validity of New Zealand's detailed standards for non-engineered adobe and rammed earth&lt;ref&gt; Morris, Hugh, R. Walker and T. Drupsteen (2011) [https://www.nzsee.org.nz/db/2011/133.pdf Modern and historic earth buildings: Observations of the 4th September 2010 Darfield Earthquake] Proceedings of the Ninth Pacific Conference on Earthquake Engineering,
14- 16 April 2011, Auckland, NZ&lt;/ref&gt; which allow unreinforced buildings to 0.6 g force levels.

Although earthbag without specific guidelines may often be this strong, conventional [[adobe]] can have severe damage at levels below 0.2 g forces.&lt;ref&gt; Tarque Ruiz, Sabino (2008) [http://www.roseschool.it/files/get/id/4480 Seismic Risk Assessment of Adobe Dwellings] University of Pavia (dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; Non-traditional earthbag built with barbed wire, barely cohesive soil and no rebar can have half the shear strength of NZ's unreinforced adobe.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (2016) Structural Information for Earthbag/ Contained Earth Walls. Build Simple Inc. www.BuildSimple.org&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 g forces, CE guidelines become important.

Based on static shear testing (Stouter, P. May 2017):
The following approximate guidelines assume a single story of {{Convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide walls with 2 strands of 4 point [[barbed wire]] per course. Check NZS 4299 for bracing wall spacing and size of bracing walls and/ or buttresses. Vertical rebar must be spaced {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on center average and embedded in wall fill while damp. Follow NZS 4299 restrictions on building size, site slope, climate, and uses.
Discuss foundation concerns with an engineer, since NZS 4299 assumes a full reinforced concrete footing.

For comparison to NZS 4299 the following risk levels are based roughly on 0.2 second spectral acceleration (Ss) from 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. Builders may refer to the Unified Facilities Handbook online&lt;ref&gt; US Army Core of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and Air Force Engineer Center. (2012) [https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/unified-facilities-criteria-ufc/ufc-3-301-01 Unified Facilities Criteria: Structural Engineering]. pp. 134- 158&lt;/ref&gt; for these values for some cities worldwide. These risk levels are based on ultimate strength, but deformation limits may require stiffer detailing or lower risk levels.
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere]]
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere]]

Medium strength soil: {{Convert|250|psi|MPa|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±0.75 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* 1.6 g risk if an entire internal rebar extends from base to bond beam

Strong soil: {{Convert|2.2|MPa|psi|0|abbr=on}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±1.6 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* ±2.1 g risk if a single rebar extends from base to bond beam

Additional research and engineering analysis is needed to create valid CE manuals.

In [[geometry]], the '''Cramer–Castillon problem''' is a problem stated by the [[Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Gabriel Cramer]] solved by the italian mathematician, resident in Berlin, [[Giovanni Salvemini|Jean de Castillon]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Stark}}, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem consists of (see the image):

Given a circle &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and three points &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; in the same plane and not on &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, to construct every possible triangle inscribed in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; whose sides (or their elongations) pass through &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Centuries before, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] had solved a special case: when the three points are collinear. But the general case had the reputation of being very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Wanner}}, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the geometrical construction of Castillon, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] found an analytic solution, easier than Castillon's. In the beginning of the 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot]] generalized it to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Ostermann and Wanner}}, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely used in the past to study colloidal [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s, [[emulsions]], [[foams]], gels, biological media and other forms of [[soft matter]]. If carefully calibrated, DWS allows the quantitative measurement of microscopic motion in a soft material, from which the [[rheological]] properties of the complex medium can be extracted via the [[microrheology]] approach.

==One-speckle diffusing-wave spectroscopy==
Laser light is sent to the sample and the outcoming transmitted or backscattered light is detected by an optoelectric sensor. The light intensity detected is the result of the interference of all the optical waves coming from the different light paths.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:figureDWS.png|Typical setup of diffusing-wave spectroscopy
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The signal is analysed by calculating the intensity [[autocorrelation]] function called g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
&lt;math&gt;g_2(\tau)=\frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau)\rangle_t}{\langle I(t)\rangle_t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For the case of non-interacting particles suspended in a (complex) fluid a direct relation between g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1  and the [[mean squared displacement]] of the particles &lt;Δr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; can be established. Let's note P(s) the probability density function (PDF) of the photon path length s. The relation can be written as follows:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g_2(\tau)-1=[\int {ds P(s) \exp(-(s/l*)k_0^2 \langle\Delta r^2(\tau)\rangle) }]^2&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;k_0=\frac{2\pi n}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l*&lt;/math&gt; is the transport mean free path of scattered light.

For simple cell geometries, it is thus possible to calculate the mean squared displacement of the particles &lt;Δr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; from the measured g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1 values analytically. For example, for the backscattering geometry, an infinitely thick cell, large laser spot illumination and detection of photons coming from the center of the spot, the relationship between g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1 and &lt;Δr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;g_2(\tau)-1=\exp\left(-2 \gamma \sqrt{\langle\Delta r^2(\tau)\rangle k_0^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, γ value is around 2.

For less thick cells and in transmission, the relationship depends also on l* (the transport length).&lt;ref&gt;

==Multispeckle Diffusing-Wave Spectroscopy (MSDWS)==

This technique either uses a camera to detect many speckle grains (see [[speckle pattern]]) or a ground glass to create a large number of speckle realizations (Echo-DWS &lt;ref&gt;http://spie.org/x8591.xml?highlight=x2404&amp;ArticleID=x8591&lt;/ref&gt;). In both cases an average over a large number of statistically independent intensity values is obtained, allowing a much faster data acquisition time.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:figureMSDWS.png|Typical setup of Multispeckle Diffusing-wave spectroscopy
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g_2(\tau)=\frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau)\rangle_p}{\langle I(t)\rangle_p^2}&lt;/math&gt;

MSDWS is particularly adapted for the study of slow dynamics and non ergodic media. Echo-DWS allows seamless integration of MSDWS in a traditional DWS-scheme with superior temporal resolution down to 12&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a highly [[sacred]] religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in particularly sacred ceremonies. They are made from bones of either the American [[bald eagle]] or the American [[golden eagle]], and are considered extremely powerful spiritual objects.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"&gt;Maroukis, Thomas Constantine (2005).

==Use==
Eagle bone whistles are only used in certain ceremonies in the Southwest and [[Plains Indians|Plains]] cultures.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"/&gt; The eagle bone whistle may be considered as a ceremonial or sacred object which may not be considered a musical instrument, if music is defined as entertainment: "There is no time or need...&lt;!--here--&gt;to wallow in distinctions between a feather-and-bone raptor and a bone whistle avian mysticism; one would no doubt end in dichotomous Western readings thereof."&lt;ref name="Gannon"/&gt;

The whistle is used in some [[Peyote]] ceremonies of some sects of the [[Native American Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Daniel C. (1999). ''Peyote Religious Art: Symbols of Faith and Belief'', p.29. University of Mississippi. {{ISBN|9781578060962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle bone whistles are used in a number of [[Sun Dance]] cultures, such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]].&lt;ref name="Shoshoni"/&gt; The eagle-bone whistle is also used by the [[Lakota people]] in certain ceremonies,&lt;ref name="Gannon"&gt;Gannon, Thomas C.

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at  [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015 | format = PDF}} As amended 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

These laws would apply to the collection and use of eagle bone whistles.

The '''Ekeby oak tree''' ({{lang-sv|Ekebyhovseken}}) is an oak tree in [[Ekerö]] outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], close to [[Ekebyhov Castle]]. It is the largest living deciduous tree in Sweden by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3GPBT_mmdo12-ekebyhovseken?guid=da0e67b7-2af4-4a2d-89a3-06665f703190 |title=GC3GPBT MMDO12: Ekebyhovseken (Traditional Cache) in Stockholm, Sweden created by fredrikr |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ekeby oak is approximately 500 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enjoysweden.se/object/eker%C3%B6j%C3%A4tten/ |title=Ekebyhovseken  |publisher=Enjoysweden.se |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared a [[natural monument]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/sthlm/nationalparker-i-stockholms-lan?rm=print Nationalparker i Stockholms län], ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', May 21, 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many old trees around Ekebyhov Castle; the oak, sometimes called ''Ekeröjätten'' (the Ekerö giant) stands alone in a field south of the castle, where it had no competition for space from other trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norgig.com/national/se/big_trees.html |title=Sveriges största träd |publisher=Norgig.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was measured in 2008 as the largest tree by volume in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekero.se/upload/natur_miljo/info%20web%20v%C3%A5rd%20av%20gamla%20tr%C3%A4d%20ver2%20110127.pdf "Vård av gamla träd i Ekebyhov"], Ekero.se, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111114000954/http://ekero.se/upload/natur_miljo/info%20web%20v%C3%A5rd%20av%20gamla%20tr%C3%A4d%20ver2%20110127.pdf archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 27 January 2011 (pdf) {{sv icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5046">'''Energy democracy''' is a political, economic, social and cultural concept that merges the technological [[energy transition]] with a strengthening of [[democracy]] and [[public participation]]. The concept is connected with an ongoing decentralization of energy systems with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] being used also for a strengthened local energy [[ownership]]. With new [[green technologies]] available, such a transition is possibly involving new actors: [[prosumer]]s, renewable energy [[co-operative]]s and municipal, community-owned [[power station]]s which replace centralised, power corporations.

This concept is promoted by [[renewable energy commercialization|renewable energy business sector]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2013/05/14/energy-democracy-video-campaign/ CleanTechnica Energy Democracy campaign website]&lt;/ref&gt; local communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewablecommunities.org/p/energy-democracy.html Renewable Communities - Energy Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[labour union]]s (e.g. [[Global Labour Institute]], [[Trade Unions for Energy Democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://unionsforenergydemocracy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), [[think tank]]s (e.g. [[Green Institute Foundation]]) etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demokracjaenergetyczna.pl Energy Democracy (Demokracja energetyczna) website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NGO]] (e.g. [[Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]]).

There are various concepts of Energy Democracy. One early concept has been published by the Berlin-based group gegenstrom 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Gegenstrom 2011, Energiepolitische Thesen http://www.gegenstromberlin.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Energiepolitische_Thesen-gsb_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis paper calls for “a 100% transition to renewable energy as quick as possible" and a reform of ownership of energy production: “dash energy corporations! Socialise energy provision! The gamete of energy democracy will be publicly owned city utilities (Stadtwerke) and energy cooperatives”.&lt;ref&gt;Gegenstrom 2011, Energiepolitische Thesen http://www.gegenstromberlin.net/2011/05/15/energiepolitische-thesen-gegen-den-fossil-nuklearen-wahn-energiedemokratie-jetzt/ and https://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak561/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The concept inspired the German climate camps in 2011, as a collection of theses and arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitung zu den Klimacamps 2011 im deutschsprachigen Raum  http://www.klimacamp2011.de/files/klimazeitung-fin2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 climate camp Lausitzcamp in Lusatia published a short summary of the concept: “Energy Democracy means ensuring that everyone has access to enough energy. However, the energy must be produced in a way that it neither harms nor endangers the environmental or people. Concretely, this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, socializing and democratizing the means of production and changing our attitude towards energy consumption.” &lt;ref&gt;quoted after the translation at Büro für eine demokratische Energiewende 2012 &lt;http://energie-demokratie.de/what-is-energy-democracy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a concept of energy democracy was promoted by the city of [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] in [[France]]. For its participation in the Bloomberg mayors challenge, the city presented an innovative vision of Energy democracy based on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and a system of incentives to encourage citizens in reducing their energy consumption.

Energy-democracy has been a successful concept of grass roots movements to combine resistance against fossil fuel exploitation like coal or shale gas with a positive alternative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Kunze, Conrad and Becker, Sören, Energy democracy in Europe: A survey and outlook, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, 2014. http://www.rosalux.de/publication/40662/energy-democracy-in-europe.html&lt;/ref&gt; "The hope, moreover, is that energy democracy might offer new spaces for collaboration between ecological movements and movements for social, economic and workplace justice."&lt;ref&gt;James Angel, Strategies of Energy Democracy, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, http://www.rosalux.de/publication/42125/strategien-der-energiedemokratie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic, James Goodman, details the difference between energy policy in Germany and India, exploring public participation in approaches to renewable energy. He concludes that 'energy policies are found to be increasingly embedded in the wider 'climate dialectic', forcing new, more transformative possibilities onto the agenda.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=James|title=The 'climate dialectic' in energy policy: Germany and India compared|journal=Energy Policy|date=2016|volume=99|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">{{refimprove|date=December 2008}} The '''Energy functional''' is the total [[energy (physics)|energy]] of a certain system, as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the system's [[Classical mechanics|state]].

In the [[energy principles in structural mechanics|energy methods]] of simulating the dynamics of complex structures, a state of the system is often described as an element of an appropriate [[function space]]. To be in this state, the system pays a certain cost in terms of energy required by the state. This energy is a scalar quantity, a function of the state, hence the term ''functional''. The system tends to develop from the state with higher energy (higher cost) to the state with lower energy, thus local minima of this functional are usually related to the stable stationary states. Studying such states is part of the [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems]], where the terms ''energy functional'' or ''cost functional'' are often used to describe the objective function.

==Examples==
* In [[Hamiltonian system]]s, the energy functional is given by the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

'''Enthalpy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|θ|əl|p|i|audio=en-US-enthalpy.ogg}}, a property of a [[thermodynamic system]], is equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |title=Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=2018-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817085918/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/E/E02141.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book. Enthalpy, H |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy.

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]]. Other historical conventional units still in use include the [[British thermal unit|British thermal unit (BTU)]] and the [[calorie]].

Enthalpy comprises a system's [[internal energy]], which is the energy required to create the system, plus the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] required to make room for it by displacing its [[environment (systems)|environment]] and establishing its volume and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark W. |last=Zemansky |date=1968 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |chapter=Chapter 11 |edition=5th |page=275 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthalpy is defined as a [[state function]] that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity.

Enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ''H''. The Δ''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes.

'''For processes under constant pressure''', Δ''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] p ΔV done by the system on its surroundings (which is &gt; 0 for an expansion and &lt; 0 for a contraction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. J. |last1=Van Wylen |first2=R. E. |last2=Sonntag |date=1985 |title=Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics |chapter=Section 5.5 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-471-82933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Enthalpy of [[ideal gas]]es and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.

==History==
The word ''enthalpy'' was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms ''[[energy]]'' (introduced in its modern sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1802) and ''[[entropy]]'' (coined in analogy to ''energy'' by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865).
It uses the root of Greek {{lang|grc|θάλπος}} "warmth, heat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qa%2Flpos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qa%2Flpos0&amp;prior=qalpno/s#lexicon θάλπος] in ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
where ''energy'' has {{lang|grc|ἔργον}} "work" and ''entropy'' {{lang|grc|τροπή}} "transformation", by analogy expressing the idea of "heat-content" where energy refers to "work-content" and entropy to "transformation-content".
The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2002) quotes [[J. R. Partington]] in ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'' (1949) as saying that the function ''H'' was "usually called the heat content".&lt;/ref&gt; 
a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as  {{mvar|dH}} refers to the amount of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ignacio |last1=Tinoco, Jr. |first2=Kenneth |last2=Sauer |first3=James C. |last3=Wang |date=1995 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=41 |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-186545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but not in the general case (when pressure is variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Keith J.|last1=Laidler |authorlink=Keith J. Laidler |first2=John H. |last2=Meiser |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] used the term "a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''The Collected Works of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol. I'' do not contain reference to the word enthalpy, but rather reference the "heat function for constant pressure". See: {{Cite book
|last1= Henderson|first1= Douglas|last2= Eyring|first2= Henry|last3= Jost|first3= Wilhelm
|title= Physical Chemistry: An Advanced Treatise
|publisher= Academic Press|year= 1967|page= 29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of the concept of "heat content" {{mvar|H}} is associated with [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]] ([[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], 1850).

The term ''enthalpy'' first appeared in print in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Dalton, ''Proc. K. Akad. Wetens. Amsterdam'' 11 (1909), p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to  [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laidler|first1= Keith|authorlink= Keith J.

&lt;/ref&gt;
It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the ''[[enthalpy–entropy chart|Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams]]'', published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol {{mvar|H}} was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in general. 
The definition of {{mvar|H}} as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;

==Formal definition==
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. A. |last=Guggenheim |title=Thermodynamics |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|chapter=Thermochemistry|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-547-12532-9|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034015/http://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + p V,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H'' is the enthalpy of the system,
:''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system,
:''p'' is the [[pressure]] of the system,
:''V'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the system.
Enthalpy is an [[extensive property]]. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the [[specific enthalpy]] ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''m''}}, where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''n''}}, where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_k H_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'' or composition, the summation becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \rho h \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density.

The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S'',''p'') of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - \delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''δQ''  is a small amount of heat added to the system, and ''δW'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives {{nowrap|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T&amp;thinsp;dS''}}, with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only ''pV'' work is done, {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}}. As a result,

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\,dS - p\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''d''(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives

:&lt;math&gt;dU + d(pV) = T\,dS - p\,dV + d(pV),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;d(U + pV) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;dH(S,p) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other expressions==
The above expression of ''dH'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT + V(1 - \alpha T)\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat capacity at constant pressure and ''α'' is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' are known as functions of ''p'' and ''T''.

Note that for an [[ideal gas]], ''αT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&lt;math&gt;\alpha T=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial (\frac{n R T}{P})}{\partial T}\right)_p = \frac{nRT}{PV} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the [[chemical potential]] and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for ''dH'' then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;dH = T\,dS + V\,dp + \sum_i \mu_i\,dN_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as {{nowrap|''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the molar chemical potential) or as {{nowrap|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the specific chemical potential).

==Physical interpretation==
The ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. |last=Reif |title=Statistical Physics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=London |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=C. |last1=Kittel |first2=H. |last2=Kroemer |title=Thermal Physics |publisher=Freeman |location=London |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that Δ''H'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].

For a [[heat engine]] a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Physik|last=Bartelmann|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2015|isbn=978-3-642-54617-4|location=|pages=1106–1108|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dH=\delta Q-\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 
where the work W done by the engine is: 
:&lt;math&gt;W=-\oint pdV&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: {{nowrap|1=''dU'' = ''δQ'' − ''δW''}}. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called ''pV'' work, given by {{nowrap|''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}} (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, ''dV'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work ''δW′'', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV'' + ''δW′''}}. In this case the first law reads:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - p\,dV - \delta W',&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q + V\,dp - \delta W'.&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]:

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (''dp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (''δW'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ebbing|first1=Darrel|last2=Gammon|first2=Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114033110/http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].

[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rathakrishnan|title=High Enthalpy Gas Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.|isbn=9781118821893|date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat of reaction===
{{Main|Standard enthalpy of reaction}}
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the ''enthalpy change'' of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = H_\mathrm{f} - H_\mathrm{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:Δ''H'' is the "enthalpy change",
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an [[exothermic reaction]] at constant [[pressure]], the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings.  In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings. If Δ''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand, if Δ''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith J. |last=Laidler |first2=John H.|last2=Meiser|date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the definition of enthalpy as &lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,&lt;/math&gt; the enthalpy change at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \Delta U + p \Delta V.&lt;/math&gt; However for most chemical reactions, the work term &lt;math&gt;p \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\Delta H.&lt;/math&gt;  As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g), &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; = –566.0 kJ and &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; = –563.5 kJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ralph H. |last=Petrucci |first2=William S.|last2=Harwood |first3=F. Geoffrey|last3=Herring |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th |pages=237–8 |isbn=978-0-13-014329-7|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of [[bond energy|bond energies]].

===Specific enthalpy===
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as ''h'' = {{sfrac|''H''|''m''}} where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The [[SI unit]] for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''u'' + ''pv''}}, where ''u'' is the specific [[internal energy]], ''p'' is the pressure, and ''v'' is [[specific volume]], which is equal to {{sfrac|''ρ''}}, where ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: 
* A [[temperature]] of 25&amp;nbsp;°C or 298.15&amp;nbsp;K,
* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1&amp;nbsp;atm or 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa),
* A [[concentration]] of 1.0&amp;nbsp;M when the element or compound is present in solution,
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.

Chemical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.
* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.
* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.
* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.
* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.
*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.
* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.
* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.
* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.

Physical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of fusion]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states.
* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.
* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.
* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).
* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

===Open systems===
In [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} - dU_\text{out} - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy entering the system, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy leaving the system.

[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation

: &lt;math&gt;\delta W = d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) + \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} + d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) - dU_\text{out} - d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of enthalpy, ''H'', permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and ''pV'' work in fluids for open systems:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dH_\text{in} - dH_\text{out} - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of time derivatives it reads:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_k \dot Q_k + \sum_k \dot H_k - \sum_k p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,&lt;/math&gt;

with sums over the various places ''k'' where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The ''Ḣ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot H_k = h_k\dot m_k = H_m\dot n_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ṁ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the mass flow and ''ṅ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term {{sfrac|''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}} represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in ''pV'' power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{clarify|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average {{sfrac|''dU''|''dt''}} may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \sum_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \sum_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \sum_k \left\langle p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points '''a''', '''b''', etc., are treated in the main text.]]

The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as ''h''–''T'' diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and ''h''–''p'' diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram (''T''–''s''-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

[[File:Schematic of throttling.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''.]]

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ''T''–''s'' diagram above. Point '''c''' is at 200&amp;nbsp;bar and room temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point '''d''', which is at a temperature of about 270&amp;nbsp;K. Hence the expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar cools nitrogen from 300&amp;nbsp;K to 270&amp;nbsp;K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point '''e''' is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 100 kJ/kg}}. It corresponds roughly with {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 13 bar}} and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 108 K}}. Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;bar ends in the two-phase region (point '''f'''). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in '''f''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in '''g''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''g'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the liquid fraction in '''f''' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in '''h''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the gas fraction in '''f''' {{nowrap|(1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. So

:&lt;math&gt; h_\mathbf{f} = x_\mathbf{f} h_\mathbf{g} + (1 - x_\mathbf{f})h_\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: {{nowrap|1=100 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; × 28 + (1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) × 230}}, so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===
{{main|Gas compressor}}
[[File:Schematic of compressor.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''. A power ''P'' is applied and a heat flow ''Q̇'' is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is [[adiabatic]], the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the ''T''–''s'' diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point '''a''') to 2 bar (point '''b''') would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is ''Q̇''. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\dot Q + \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2 + P.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{\dot Q}{T_\mathrm{a}} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''Q̇'' gives for the minimal power

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, compressing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1&amp;nbsp;bar to 200&amp;nbsp;bar costs at least {{nowrap|1=(''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. With the data, obtained with the ''T''–''s'' diagram, we find a value of {{nowrap|1=(430 − 461) − 300 × (5.16 − 6.85) =}} 476&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(dh - T_\mathrm{a}\,ds).&lt;/math&gt;

With {{nowrap|1=''dh'' = ''T''&amp;thinsp;''ds'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dp''}}, this results in the final relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2 v\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">'''Ethical naturalism''' (also called '''moral naturalism''' or '''naturalistic cognitivistic definism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:

# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.
# These moral features of the world ''are'' [[reductionism|reducible]] to some set of non-moral features

==Overview==
It is important to distinguish the versions of ethical naturalism which have received the most sustained philosophical interest, for example, [[Cornell realism]], from the position that "the way things are is always the way they ought to be", which few ethical naturalists hold. Ethical naturalism does, however, reject the [[fact-value distinction]]: it suggests that inquiry into the natural world can increase our moral knowledge in just the same way it increases our scientific knowledge. Indeed, proponents of ethical naturalism have argued that humanity needs to invest in the [[science of morality]], a broad and loosely defined field that uses evidence from biology, primatology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and other areas to classify and describe moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Science of Morality|url=https://www.edge.org/event/the-new-science-of-morality|website=edge.org|publisher=Edge Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=Oct 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/articles/miller.2008.roots-of-morality.science.pdf|accessdate=October 27, 2017|agency=Science Magazine|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical naturalism encompasses any reduction of ethical properties, such as 'goodness', to non-ethical properties; there are many different examples of such reductions, and thus many different varieties of ethical naturalism. [[Hedonism]], for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just [[pleasure]].

==Criticisms==
Ethical naturalism has been criticized most prominently by [[ethical non-naturalist]] [[G. E. Moore]], who formulated the [[open-question argument]]. Garner and Rosen say that a common definition of "natural property" is one "which can be discovered by sense observation or experience, experiment, or through any of the available means of science." They also say that a good definition of "natural property" is problematic but that "it is only in criticism of naturalism, or in an attempt to distinguish between naturalistic and nonnaturalistic definist theories, that such a concept is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. M. Hare]] also criticised ethical naturalism because of its fallacious definition of the terms 'good' or 'right' explaining how value-terms being part of our prescriptive moral language are not reducible to descriptive terms: "Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hare|M.R.|1964|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral relativism===
When it comes to the moral questions that we might ask, it can be difficult to argue that there is not necessarily some level of [[Moral relativism|meta-ethical relativism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} – and failure to address this matter is criticized as [[ethnocentrism]]. [[File:The punishment of Bessus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Could torture under certain conditions be "wrong" for a species?]]

As a broad example of relativism, we would no doubt see very different moral systems in an alien race that can only survive by occasionally ingesting one another. As a narrow example, there would be further specific moral opinions for each individual of that species.

Some forms of [[moral realism]] are compatible with some degree of meta-ethical relativism. This argument rests on the assumption that one can have a "moral" discussion on various scales; that is, what is "good" for: a certain part of your being (leaving open the possibility of conflicting motives), you as a single individual, your family, your society, your species, your type of species. For example, a [[moral universalism|moral universalist]] (and certainly an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]]) might argue that, just as one can discuss what is 'good and evil' at an individual's level, so too can one make certain "moral" propositions with truth values relative at the level of the species. In other words, the moral relativist need not deem ''all'' moral propositions as necessarily subjective. The answer to "''is free speech normally good for human societies?''" is relative in a sense, but the moral realist would argue that an individual can be incorrect in this matter. This may be the philosophical equivalent of the more pragmatic arguments made by some scientists.

===Moral nihilism===
[[Moral nihilism|Moral nihilists]] maintain that any talk of an objective morality is incoherent and better off using other terms. Proponents of [[Science of morality|moral science]] like Ronald A. Lindsay have counter-argued that their way of understanding "morality" as a practical enterprise is the way we ought to have understood it in the first place. He holds the position that the alternative seems to be the elaborate philosophical reduction of the word "moral" into a vacuous, useless term.&lt;ref name=Ron&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/centerstage/episodes/episode_24_bioethics_and_public_policy_part_1 Center Stage | Episode 24 – Bioethics and Public Policy, Part 1]. Center for Inquiry (2010-04-12). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay adds that it is important to reclaim the specific word "Morality" because of the connotations it holds with many individuals.

==Morality as a science==

{{Main|Science of morality}}

Author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has argued that we overestimate the relevance of many arguments against the science of morality, arguments he believes scientists happily and rightly disregard in other domains of science like physics. For example, scientists may find themselves attempting to argue against philosophical [[Skepticism|skeptics]], when Harris says they should be practically asking – as they would in any other domain – "why would we listen to a [[solipsism|solipsist]] in the first place?" This, Harris contends, is part of what it means to practice a science of morality.

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] believes that conceiving of morality as a science could be a case of [[scientific imperialism]] and insists that what is "good for conscious creatures" is not an adequate working definition of "moral".&lt;ref name="blogs.discovermagazine.com"&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/ Sam Harris Responds | Cosmic Variance | Discover Magazine]. Blogs.discovermagazine.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, Vice President at the [[Center for Inquiry]], John Shook, claims that this working definition is more than adequate for science at present, and that disagreement should not immobilize the scientific study of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/sam_harris_vs._the_philosophers_on_morality/ Sam Harris vs. The Philosophers on Morality]. Center for Inquiry (2010-05-14). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collective ''The End of Christianity'', Richard Carrier's chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" sets out to propose a form of [[moral realism]] centered on human satisfaction.{{Explain|date=June 2018|reason=What Carrier says and why Carrier contribution is worth mention VS other philosophers }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=W. Loftus (ed.) |first1=John |title=The end of Christianity |date=2011 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, N.Y. |isbn=9781616144135 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kXbaUE8cT64C&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Shishapangma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sam Harris argues that there are societally optimal "moral peaks" to discover.]]
In modern times, many thinkers discussing the [[fact–value distinction]] and the [[is–ought problem]] have settled on the idea that one cannot derive ''ought'' from ''is''. Conversely, Harris maintains that the fact-value distinction is a confusion, proposing that values are really a certain kind of fact. Specifically, Harris suggests that values amount to empirical statements about "the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society". He argues that there are objective answers to moral questions, even if some are difficult or impossible to possess in practice. In this way, he says, science can tell us what to value. Harris adds that we do not demand absolute certainty from predictions in physics so we should not demand that of a science studying morality (see ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'').

'''Exergonix Inc,''' is an [[energy storage]] company based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. It was founded in 2010, after spinning out of [[Kokam America]], Inc., which was acquired by [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 2009. Exergonix develops, manufactures and deploys community-level and [[grid energy storage]] to supply [[Peaking power plant|peak-shaving]], [[demand response|demand-management]], and [[smart grid]] capabilities to the grid and micro-grid.

The company designs and builds [[renewable energy]] solutions for a wide range of applications including storage for [[solar energy|solar]] and [[wind power]], [[Energy demand management|utility management]], the [[United States Armed Forces|military]], [[telecommunications]] cell towers and [[Uninterruptible power supply|emergency back-up]].

==Background==

===History===
According to the company president’s statement to the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]] in 2012, the company’s mission is to make renewable energy cost effective and will allow nations around the world to implement a worldwide, workable, smart and decentralized utility grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg77859/html/CHRG-112shrg77859.htm Promoting American Competitiveness: Filling Jobs Today And Training Workers For Tomorrow] at [[U.S. Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-04-17/html/CREC-2012-04-17-pt1-PgD355.htm United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies] at [[U.S. Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company makes a “promising energy storage application”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2014/02/14/enUK201402140367 Grid-Scale Energy Storage in North America 2013: Applications, Technologies and Suppliers] in ''[[American City Business Journals|Kansas City Business Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility sits atop 83 acres of land on [[Missouri Route 291]] and [[U.S. Route 50]], previously owned by [[Pfizer|Pfizer, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://kcmetro.com/2011061731007/local-news/lee-s-summit-mo/exergonix-closes-on-pfizer-property.html Exergonix closes on Pfizer property]&lt;/ref&gt; Valued at $90 million, the company raised another $2 million from local angel investor group, and a $1.4 million package from the [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|City of Lee’s Summit]], [[Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/print-edition/2011/01/07/angels-aid-pursuit-of-exergonix.html?page=3 Angel investors aid pursuit of Exergonix] in ''[[American City Business Journals|Kansas City Business Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also from Senators [[Kit Bond]] and [[Jim Talent]], the company further secured $8 million in federal funding from a defense spending bill, to bring a new manufacturing plant to Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucmo.edu/today/archives/06/fall/industry.cfm?print=yes&amp; Nissanka's Charge Could Revolutionize an Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the "Green Energy Park" was dialed back to $50 million, after $100 million federal money fell through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/11138396/1/exergonix-extends-talks-for-lees-summit-incentives.html#disqus_thread Exergonix Extends Talks For Lee's Summit Incentives], May 31, 2011. ''[[TheStreet.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
The CEO had approached [[Missouri General Assembly|state legislators]] to seek $650 million for a manufacturing plant in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouripartnership.com/Sites-Incentives-Data/Data-Center/Industry-Insight-Blog/itemid/148/amid/717/kokam-america-seeks-state-incentives-for-lees-summit-plant Kokam America seeks state incentives for Lee's Summit plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The CEO approached the [[United States Department of Defense]] with new battery technology and although the agency was interested, its budget was committed. Senator [[Kit Bond]] was then approached with the request to include the money in the department's budget.

Nissanka said: "I would say that the reason we got the money has nothing to do with a high-power lobbyist, we got it because of our technology. Earmarks unfortunately are the only way you can drive new technology into the market." Nissanka provided testimony during Senator [[Roy Blunt]]’s attempt at [[Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2013]].

Exergonix received $2 million to build and install a 1 megawatt utility storage at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] in [[Knob Noster, Missouri]] in order to demonstrate the ability of the [[US military]] to provide safe and effective energy security solutions compounded with renewable energy. The battery technology offered an improved cycle life, lighter weight, wider operating temperature range and true maintenance-free design. Applications include many aerospace and defense uses, such as weapon platforms, aircraft and future land warrior programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2008/Jun/20080608Pers001.asp As a Missouri senator earmarks millions, watchdog groups complain] at ''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=96451d00-69c5-4cc4-979a-e961e395d06b Congress Approves Brown-Blunt Manufacturing Bill In Omnibus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy storage projects==
In 2010, as part of [[Emanuel Cleaver]]’s Green Impact Zone in [[Kansas City]], Exergonix along with [[Siemens]], [[Electric Power Research Institute]], [[Landis+Gyr]], [[Intergraph]], [[Tendril]], [[City of Kansas City]] and the [[Mid-America Regional Council]] launched a pilot project for SmartGrid development under [[Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability]] with funding from [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] in partnership with [[Kansas City Power and Light]]. The project aimed to generate greater [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], reduced cost, improved reliability, more transparent and interactive information, and an improved [[environmental footprint]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smartgrid.gov/project/kansas_city_power_and_light_green_impact_zone_smartgrid_demonstration.html Kansas City SmartGrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] expressed bright futures talking to [[Smith Electric Vehicles]]’s USA branch about clean technology jobs, where Kokam America was the battery supplier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/18/smith-electric-vehicles-us-choose-kokam-as-battery-supplier/ SEV choose Kokam as suppliers] at ''Autoblog''&lt;/ref&gt; and CEO Don Nissanka (also formerly Kokam America President and CEO) was on the board. Besides Smith Electric, Nissanka had customers in the EV market, but he declined to disclose any of their names. He was also on the 18-member taskforce on Automotive Jobs Task Force, appointed by Governor [[Jay Nixon]] in 2009.

"The future is here for us in terms of the battery technology," said Nissanka&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/update-gov-jay-nixon-tours-missouri-battery-plant/article_4c6c0834-669e-5104-85fa-aa484ba1bdba.html Gov. Jay Nixon tours Missouri battery plant] at ''[[Columbia Missourian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissanka also initiated the “[https://www.ucmo.edu/mic/ Missouri Innovation Campus]” (MIC) which was Obama’s travel stop for a speech at [[University of Central Missouri]].

“I think the president is right on, I think the administration has done a good job of putting enough money into this economy right now. We’re in a depression and we needed this money to fuel the economy and fuel the jobs. I see it happening. It’s happening around the country”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wynstonhill.com/index.php/obama-touts-energy-investments-during-stop-at-electric-vehicle-plant/ Obama touts Energy Investments]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[InformationWeek]]'', the company along with a handful of other battery storage firms, shares [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]]’s ambition of disruptive home power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/tesla-battery-looks-to-disrupt-home-office-power-consumption/d/d-id/1319144 Tesla Battery Looks To Disrupt Home, Office Power Consumption] at ''[[InformationWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreline''' is a [[vacuum]] line between the [[pump]]s of a [[wikt:multistage|multistage]] vacuum system. No longer exclusively used by [[scientist]]s in [[research]], vacuum systems are used in numerous industries that include [[food production]] and the [[manufacture|manufacturing]] of [[electronic component]]s. A classic foreline is a [[hose]] or [[Pneumatic tube|tube]] that connects a [[rotary vane pump]] to the [[wikt:outlet|outlet]] of an [[oil diffusion pump]], although vacuum [[technology]] now uses a vast array of [[roughing pump]]s and high [[vacuum pump]]s.

Although the term has been used for many [[decade]]s in the high vacuum system [[industry]] and in [[literature]] concerning vacuum systems, the word foreline has not yet been added to any [[dictionary]].

{{distinguish|Transformation geometry}}

A '''geometric transformation''' is any [[bijection]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] having some geometric structure to itself or another such set. Specifically, "A geometric transformation is a function whose domain and range are sets of points. Most often the domain and range of a geometric transformation are both R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or both R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Often geometric transformations are required to be 1-1 functions, so that they have inverses." &lt;ref&gt;Zalman Usiskin, Anthony L. Peressini, [[Elena Marchisotto]] – ''Mathematics for High School Teachers: An Advanced Perspective'', page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[geometry]] may be approached via the study of these transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Gerard A.|last=Venema|title=Foundations of Geometry|year=2006|publisher=[[Pearson Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780131437005|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric transformations can be classified by the dimension of their operand sets (thus distinguishing between planar transformations and those of space, for example). They can also be classified according to the properties they preserve:
* [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]s preserve [[distance]]s and [[angle|oriented angles]];
* [[Isometry|isometries]] preserve angles and distances;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{google books |id=pN0iAVavPR8C|

page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]] preserve angles and ratios between distances;
* [[affine transformation]]s preserve [[parallelism (geometry)|parallelism]];&lt;ref name=Berger /&gt;
* [[projective transformation]]s preserve [[collinearity (geometry)|collinearity]];&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Leland Wilkinson, D. Wills, D. Rope, A. Norton, R. Dubbs – ''{{google books|id=NRyGnjeNKJIC|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these classes contains the previous one.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt;

*[[Circle inversion]] preserve the set of all lines and circles in the planar case (but may interchange lines and circles), and [[Möbius transformation]]s conserve all planes and spheres in dimension 3.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

* [[Diffeomorphism]]s (bidifferentiable transformations) are the transformations that are affine in the first order; they contain the preceding ones as special cases, and can be further refined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = first fundamental form| format=PDF|author = stevecheng| work = planetmath.org| date = 2013-03-13| accessdate = 2014-10-01| url = http://planetmath.org/sites/default/files/texpdf/37332.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conformal transformation]]s, preserving angles, are, in the first order, similarities.
* [[Equiareal map|equiareal transformations]], preserve areas in the planar case or volumes in the three dimensional case.&lt;ref&gt;{{google books|id=Y6jDAgAAQBAJ|page=191}} Bruce E. Meserve – Fundamental Concepts of Geometry, page 191.]&lt;/ref&gt; and are, in the first order, affine transformations of [[determinant]] 1.
*[[Homeomorphism]]s (bicontinuous transformations), preserve the neighborhoods of points.

The '''history of Earth''' concerns the development of [[planet]] [[Earth]] from its formation to the present day.{{r|Stanley2005|TimeScale}} Nearly all branches of [[natural science]] have contributed to understanding of the main events of Earth's past, characterized by constant [[geology|geological]] change and biological [[evolution]].

The geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention,&lt;ref&gt;"International Stratigraphic Chart". International Commission on Stratigraphy&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the large spans of time from the beginning of the Earth to the present, and its divisions chronicle some definitive events of Earth history. (In the graphic:  [[Year#Abbreviations yr and ya|Ga]] means "billion years ago"; [[Year#Abbreviations yr and ya|Ma]], "million years ago".) Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the [[age of the universe]], by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] from the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation of the planets|solar nebula]].&lt;ref name="USGS1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic [[outgassing]] probably created the primordial [[atmosphere]] and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no [[oxygen]]. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While Earth was in its earliest stage ([[Early Earth]]), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] is thought to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]], and allowing liquid water on the surface.

The Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the formation of the planet and ended 4.0  billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons produced the [[abiogenesis|beginnings of life]] on Earth and its [[Evolution|earliest evolution]]. The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic, divided into three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on land; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the [[Cenozoic]], which saw the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale.

The Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life has since its first appearance. Species continue to [[evolution|evolve]], taking on new forms, splitting into daughter species, or going extinct in the face of ever-changing physical environments. The process of [[plate tectonics]] continues to shape the Earth's continents and oceans and the life they harbor. Human activity is now a dominant force affecting global change, harming the [[biosphere]], the Earth's surface, [[hydrosphere]], and atmosphere with the loss of wild lands, over-exploitation of the oceans, production of [[greenhouse gases]], degradation of the [[ozone layer]], and general degradation of soil, air, and water quality.

==Eons==
In [[geochronology]], time is generally measured in mya ([[megayear]]s or million years), each unit representing the period of approximately 1,000,000 years in the past. The history of Earth is divided into four great [[eon (geology)|eon]]s, starting 4,540 mya with the formation of the planet. Each eon saw the most significant changes in Earth's composition, climate and life. Each eon is subsequently divided into [[era (geology)|era]]s, which in turn are divided into [[period (geology)|period]]s, which are further divided into [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]s.
{|class="wikitable"
! Eon
! Time (mya)
! Description
|-
| [[Hadean]]
| 4,540–4,000
| The Earth is formed out of debris around the solar [[protoplanetary disk]]. There is no life. Temperatures are extremely hot, with frequent volcanic activity and hellish environments. The atmosphere is nebular. Possible early oceans or bodies of liquid water. The moon is formed around this time, probably due to a [[Giant-impact hypothesis|protoplanet's collision into Earth]].
|-
| [[Archean]]
| 4,000–2,500
| [[Prokaryote]] life, the first form of life, emerges at the very beginning of this eon, in a process known as [[abiogenesis]]. The continents of [[Ur (continent)|Ur]], [[Vaalbara]] and [[Kenorland]] may have been formed around this time. The atmosphere is composed of volcanic and greenhouse gases.
|-
| [[Proterozoic]]
| 2,500–541
| [[Eukaryote]]s, a more complex form of life, emerge, including some forms of [[multicellular organism]]s. [[Bacteria]] begin producing oxygen, shaping the third and current of Earth's atmospheres. Plants, later animals and possibly earlier forms of fungi form around this time. The early and late phases of this eon may have undergone "[[Snowball Earth]]" periods, in which all of the planet suffered below-zero temperatures. The early continents of [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], [[Rodinia]] and [[Pannotia]] may have formed around this time, in that order.
|-
| [[Phanerozoic]]
| 541–present
| [[Complex life]], including [[vertebrate]]s, begin to dominate the Earth's ocean in a process known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. [[Pangaea]] forms and later dissolves into [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]]. Gradually, life expands to land and all familiar forms of plants, animals and fungi begin appearing, including annelids, insects and reptiles. Several [[mass extinction]]s occur, among which birds, the descendants of dinosaurs, and more recently mammals emerge. Modern animals—[[human evolution|including humans]]—evolve at the most recent phases of this eon.

[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An artist's rendering of a [[protoplanetary disk]]]]
The standard model for the formation of the [[Solar System]] (including the [[Earth]]) is the [[Nebular hypothesis|solar nebula hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Encrenaz|first=T.|title=The solar system|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-00241-3|page=89|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the Solar System formed from a large, rotating cloud of interstellar dust and gas called the [[solar nebula]]. It was composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] created [[Recombination (cosmology)|shortly after]] the [[Big Bang]] 13.8&amp;nbsp;[[Gigaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] (billion years ago) and heavier [[chemical element|elements]] ejected by [[supernovae]]. About 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[A (year)|Ga]], the nebula began a contraction that may have been triggered by the [[shock wave]] from a nearby [[supernova]].{{r|Matson}} A shock wave would have also made the nebula rotate. As the cloud began to accelerate, its [[angular momentum]], [[Gravitation|gravity]], and [[inertia]] flattened it into a [[protoplanetary disk]] perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Small [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] due to collisions and the angular momentum of other large debris created the means by which kilometer-sized [[protoplanet]]s began to form, orbiting the nebular center.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973&gt;{{cite journal | author=P. Goldreich | author2=W. R. Ward | title=The Formation of Planetesimals | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1973 | volume=183 | pages=1051–1062 | bibcode=1973ApJ...183.1051G | doi=10.1086/152291 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of the nebula, not having much angular momentum, collapsed rapidly, the compression heating it until [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen into helium began. After more contraction, a [[T Tauri star]] ignited and evolved into the [[Sun]]. Meanwhile, in the outer part of the nebula gravity caused [[matter]] to condense around density perturbations and dust particles, and the rest of the protoplanetary disk began separating into rings. In a process known as runaway [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], successively larger fragments of dust and debris clumped together to form planets.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973/&gt; Earth formed in this manner about 4.54&amp;nbsp;billion years ago (with an [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] of 1%){{r|age_earth1c|age_of_earth_faq|USGS1997|age_earth4}} and was largely completed within 10–20&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years.{{r|Yin}} The [[solar wind]] of the newly formed T Tauri star cleared out most of the material in the disk that had not already condensed into larger bodies. The same process is expected to produce [[accretion disks]] around virtually all newly forming stars in the universe, some of which yield [[Extrasolar planet|planets]].{{r|Kokubo2002}}

The proto-Earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy, [[siderophile element|siderophile]] [[metal]]s. Having higher [[density|densities]] than the silicates, these metals sank. This so-called ''[[iron catastrophe]]'' resulted in the separation of a [[primitive mantle]] and a (metallic) core only 10&amp;nbsp;million years after the Earth began to form, producing the layered [[Structure of the Earth|structure of Earth]] and setting up the formation of [[Earth's magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Frankel, 1996, ''Volcanoes of the Solar System,'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 7–8, {{ISBN|978-0-521-47770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.

==Hadean and Archean Eons==
{{Main|Hadean|Archean}}
[[File:Earth formation.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of [[Hadean Eon]] Earth, when it was much hotter and inhospitable to all forms of life.]]
The first [[eon (geology)|eon]] in Earth's history, the ''Hadean'',  begins with the Earth's formation and is followed by the ''Archean'' eon at 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga.{{r|TimeScale|page1=145}} The oldest rocks found on Earth date to about 4.0&amp;nbsp;Ga, and the oldest [[detrital]] [[zircon]] crystals in rocks to about 4.4&amp;nbsp;Ga,{{r|nature1|Lindsey|Cavosie}} soon after the formation of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the Earth itself. The [[giant impact hypothesis]] for the Moon's formation states that shortly after formation of an initial crust, the proto-Earth was impacted by a smaller protoplanet, which ejected part of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and crust into space and created the Moon.{{r|belbruno|Carsten|moonwalk}}

From [[crater count]]s on other celestial bodies, it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts, called the ''[[Late Heavy Bombardment]]'', began about 4.1&amp;nbsp;Ga, and concluded around 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga, at the end of the Hadean.{{r|space.com-bombardment}} In addition, volcanism was severe due to the large [[heat flow]] and [[geothermal gradient]].{{r|Green}} Nevertheless, detrital zircon crystals dated to 4.4&amp;nbsp;Ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water, suggesting that the Earth already had oceans or seas at that time.{{r|nature1}}

By the beginning of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly. Present life forms could not have survived at Earth's surface, because the Archean atmosphere lacked [[oxygen]] hence had no [[ozone layer]] to block ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it is believed that primordial life began to evolve by the early Archean, with candidate [[fossil]]s dated to around 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga.{{r|Taylor-2006}} Some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early Hadean, as far back as 4.4&amp;nbsp;Ga, surviving the possible Late Heavy Bombardment period in [[hydrothermal vents]] below the Earth's surface.{{r|reuters1}}

===Formation of the Moon===
{{Main|Moon|Origin of the Moon|Giant impact hypothesis}}
[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of the enormous collision that probably formed the Moon]]
Earth's only [[natural satellite]], the Moon, is larger relative to its planet than any other satellite in the solar system.{{#tag:ref|[[Pluto]]'s satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is relatively larger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/pluto/ |title=Space Topics: Pluto and Charon |publisher=The Planetary Society |accessdate=6 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BdV5X0c?url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/pluto/ |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Pluto is defined as a [[dwarf planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Pluto|title=Pluto: Overview |work=Solar System Exploration |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} During the [[Apollo program]], rocks from the Moon's surface were brought to Earth. [[Radiometric dating]] of these rocks shows that the Moon is 4.53&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;billion years old,{{r|Kleine}} formed at least 30&amp;nbsp;million years after the solar system.{{r|Halliday}} New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.02&amp;nbsp;Ga, or 70–110&amp;nbsp;million years after the start of the Solar System.{{r|halliday-2008}}

Theories for the formation of the Moon must explain its late formation as well as the following facts. First, the Moon has a low density (3.3 times that of water, compared to 5.5 for the earth{{r|earth_fact_sheet}}) and a small metallic core. Second, there is virtually no water or other volatiles on the moon. Third, the Earth and Moon have the same oxygen [[isotopic signature]] (relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes). Of the theories proposed to account for these phenomena, one is widely accepted: The ''giant impact hypothesis''  proposes that the Moon originated after a body the size of [[Mars]] (sometimes named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]]{{r|Halliday}}) struck the proto-Earth a glancing blow.{{r|Stanley2005|StarChild|Canup|page1=256}}

The collision released about 100 million times more energy than the more recent [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]] that is believed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. It was enough to vaporize some of the Earth's outer layers and melt both bodies.{{r|StarChild|Stanley2005|page2=256}} A portion of the mantle material was [[ejecta|ejected]] into orbit around the Earth. The giant impact hypothesis predicts that the Moon was depleted of metallic material,{{r|Liu}} explaining its abnormal composition.{{r|Newsom}} The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, the ejected material became a more spherical body: the Moon.{{r|Taylor}}

===First continents===
[[File:North america terrain 2003 map.jpg|thumb|Geologic map of North America, color-coded by age. The reds and pinks indicate rock from the [[Archean]]. |alt=Map with color and texture]]
[[Mantle convection]], the process that drives plate tectonics, is a result of heat flow from the Earth's interior to the Earth's surface.{{r|DaviesMantle|page1=2}} It involves the creation of rigid [[tectonic plate]]s at [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s. These plates are destroyed by [[subduction]] into the mantle at [[subduction zone]]s. During the early Archean (about 3.0&amp;nbsp;Ga) the mantle was much hotter than today, probably around {{convert|1600|C}},{{r|Cattermole|page1=82}} so convection in the mantle was faster. Although a process similar to present-day plate tectonics did occur, this would have gone faster too. It is likely that during the Hadean and Archean, subduction zones were more common, and therefore tectonic plates were smaller.{{r|Stanley2005|page1=258}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=Geoffrey F.|title=Mantle convection for geologists|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-19800-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial crust, formed when the Earth's surface first solidified, totally disappeared from a combination of this fast Hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment. However, it is thought that it was [[basalt]]ic in composition, like today's [[oceanic crust]], because little crustal differentiation had yet taken place.{{r|Stanley2005|page1=258}} The first larger pieces of [[continental crust]], which is a product of differentiation of lighter elements during [[partial melting]] in the lower crust, appeared at the end of the Hadean, about 4.0&amp;nbsp;Ga. What is left of these first small continents are called [[craton]]s. These pieces of late Hadean and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |bibcode=2004AGUSM.T41C..01B |title=What is a craton?  |author=Bleeker, W. |authorlink= |author2=B. W. Davis |date=May 2004 |publisher=American Geophysical Union |conference=Spring meeting |booktitle= |pages= |location= |id=T41C-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oldest dated rocks|oldest rocks]] on Earth are found in the [[North American craton]] of [[Canada]]. They are [[tonalite]]s from about 4.0&amp;nbsp;Ga. They show traces of [[metamorphism]] by high temperature, but also sedimentary grains that have been rounded by erosion during transport by water, showing that rivers and seas existed then.{{r|Lunine}} Cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of [[terrane]]s. The first are so-called [[greenstone belt]]s, consisting of low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. These "greenstones" are similar to the sediments today found in [[oceanic trench]]es, above subduction zones. For this reason, greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the Archean. The second type is a complex of [[felsic]] [[magmatic rock]]s. These rocks are mostly tonalite, [[trondhjemite]] or [[granodiorite]], types of rock similar in composition to [[granite]] (hence such terranes are called TTG-terranes). TTG-complexes are seen as the [[relict (geology)|relicts]] of the first continental crust, formed by partial melting in basalt.{{r|Condie|page1=Chapter 5}}

===Oceans and atmosphere===
{{See also|Origin of the world's oceans}}
[[File:Oxygenation-atm.svg|thumb|300px|Graph showing range of estimated [[partial pressure]] of atmospheric oxygen through geologic time {{r|Holland-2006}}]]
Earth is often described as having had three atmospheres. The first atmosphere, captured from the solar nebula, was composed of light ([[atmophile]]) elements from the solar nebula, mostly hydrogen and helium. A combination of the solar wind and Earth's heat would have driven off this atmosphere, as a result of which the atmosphere is now depleted of these elements compared to cosmic abundances.&lt;ref name=Kasting93/&gt; After the impact which created the moon, the molten Earth released volatile gases; and later more gases were released by [[volcano]]es, completing a second atmosphere rich in [[greenhouse gas]]es but poor in oxygen. {{r|Stanley2005|page1=256}} Finally, the third atmosphere, rich in oxygen, emerged when bacteria [[Great Oxygenation Event|began to produce oxygen]] about 2.8&amp;nbsp;Ga.{{r|Gale|page1=83–84,116–117}}

In early models for the formation of the atmosphere and ocean, the second atmosphere was formed by outgassing of [[volatiles]] from the Earth's interior. Now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as ''impact degassing'' in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact. The ocean and atmosphere would, therefore, have started to form even as the Earth formed.{{r|Kasting03}} The new atmosphere probably contained [[water vapor]], carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and smaller amounts of other gases.{{r|Kasting-2006}}

Planetesimals at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]] (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long.{{r|Kasting03}}&lt;ref name=Selsis&gt;{{cite book |last=Selsis |first=Franck |chapter=Chapter 11. The Prebiotic Atmosphere of the Earth |title=Astrobiology: Future perspectives |series=Astrophysics and space science library |volume=305 |pages=267–286 |date=2005 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-2305-7_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU.{{r|Kasting03|Morbidelli}} Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than [[Neptune]], computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system.{{r|Lunine|page1=130–132}}

As the Earth cooled, [[cloud]]s formed. Rain created the oceans. Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4&amp;nbsp;Ga.{{r|nature1}} By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth. This early formation has been difficult to explain because of a problem known as the [[faint young Sun paradox]]. Stars are known to get brighter as they age, and at the time of its formation the Sun would have been emitting only 70% of its current power. Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/evolution.html The Sun's evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; Many models indicate that the Earth would have been covered in ice.{{r|Sagan|Kasting03}} A likely solution is that there was enough carbon dioxide and methane to produce a [[greenhouse effect]]. The carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes. Another greenhouse gas, ammonia, would have been ejected by volcanos but quickly destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.{{r|Gale|page1=83}}

===Origin of life===
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Abiogenesis|Earliest known life forms|Evolution|Evolutionary history of life}}
One of the reasons for interest in the early atmosphere and ocean is that they form the conditions under which life first arose. There are many models, but little consensus, on how life emerged from non-living chemicals; chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a living organism.{{r|Szathmary|Luisi}}

The first step in the emergence of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler [[Organic chemistry|organic]] compounds, including [[nucleobases]] and [[amino acids]], that are the building blocks of life. An [[Miller–Urey experiment|experiment in 1953]] by [[Stanley Miller]] and [[Harold Urey]] showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of [[lightning]].{{r|Lazcano}} Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules.{{r|NYTimes}} [[Computer simulation]]s show that [[Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules|extraterrestrial organic molecules]] could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth.{{r|Space-20120329}}

Additional complexity could have been reached from at least three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are similar to itself; [[metabolism]], its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.{{r|Pereto}}

====Replication first: RNA world====
{{Main|RNA world}}
Even the simplest members of the [[three-domain system|three modern domains]] of life use [[DNA]] to record their "[[Genetic memory (biology)|recipes]]" and a complex array of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules to "read" these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance, and self-replication.

The discovery that a kind of RNA molecule called a [[ribozyme]] can [[catalyst|catalyze]] both its own replication and the construction of proteins led to the hypothesis that earlier life-forms were based entirely on RNA.{{r|Joyce}} They could have formed an [[RNA world]] in which there were individuals but no [[species]], as [[mutation]]s and [[horizontal gene transfer]]s would have meant that the offspring in each generation were quite likely to have different [[genomes]] from those that their parents started with.{{r|Hoenigsberg}} RNA would later have been replaced by DNA, which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes, expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have.{{r|Forterre}} Ribozymes remain as the main components of [[ribosome]]s, the "protein factories" of modern cells.{{r|Cech}}

Although short, self-replicating RNA molecules have been artificially produced in laboratories,{{r|Johnston}} doubts have been raised about whether natural non-biological synthesis of RNA is possible.{{r|Levy|Larralde|Lindahl}} The earliest ribozymes may have been formed of simpler [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]], [[Threose nucleic acid|TNA]] or [[Glycerol nucleic acid|GNA]], which would have been replaced later by RNA.{{r|Orgel|Nelson}}  Other [[Peptide-RNA world|pre-RNA replicators]] have been posited, including  [[crystal]]s{{r|Dawkins-Watchmaker|page1=150}} and even quantum systems.{{r|Daviesb}}

In 2003 it was proposed that porous metal sulfide [[precipitate]]s would assist RNA synthesis at about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and at ocean-bottom pressures near [[hydrothermal vent]]s. In this hypothesis, the proto-cells would be confined in the pores of the metal substrate until the later development of lipid membranes.{{r|Martin}}

====Metabolism first: iron–sulfur world====
[[File:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|upright|The replicator in virtually all known life is [[deoxyribonucleic acid]]. DNA is far more complex than the original replicator and its replication systems are highly elaborate.]]
{{Main|iron–sulfur world theory}}
Another long-standing hypothesis is that the first life was composed of protein molecules. Amino acids, the building blocks of [[proteins]], are easily synthesized in plausible prebiotic conditions, as are small [[peptides]] ([[polymers]] of amino acids) that make good catalysts.{{r|Kauffman|page1=295–297}}  A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that amino acids and peptides could form in the presence of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] with [[iron(II) sulfide|iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as catalysts. Most of the steps in their assembly required temperatures of about {{convert|100|C}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|C}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi|sp=us}} of rock. Hence, self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.{{r|Wachtershauser}}

A difficulty with the metabolism-first scenario is finding a way for organisms to evolve. Without the ability to replicate as individuals, aggregates of molecules would have "compositional genomes" (counts of molecular species in the aggregate) as the target of natural selection. However, a recent model shows that such a system is unable to evolve in response to natural selection.{{r|Vasas}}

====Membranes first: Lipid world====
It has been suggested that double-walled "bubbles" of [[lipid]]s like those that form the external membranes of cells may have been an essential first step.{{r|Trevors01}} Experiments that simulated the conditions of the early Earth have reported the formation of lipids, and these can spontaneously form [[liposome]]s, double-walled "bubbles", and then reproduce themselves. Although they are not intrinsically information-carriers as nucleic acids are, they would be subject to [[natural selection]] for longevity and reproduction. Nucleic acids such as RNA might then have formed more easily within the liposomes than they would have outside.{{r|Segre}}

====The clay theory====
{{further|Graham Cairns-Smith#Clay hypothesis}}
Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their crystalline pattern, are subject to an analog of [[natural]] selection (as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant), and can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules.{{r|Cairns-Smith}} Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.{{r|Ferris|Dawkins-Watchmaker|page1=150–158}}
[[File:Liposome cross section.png|thumb|upright|Cross-section through a [[liposome]]]]
Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles", and that the bubbles could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. Bubbles can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and dividing. The formation of the earliest [[Cell (biology)|cells]] may have been aided by similar processes.{{r|Hanczyc}}

A similar hypothesis presents self-replicating iron-rich clays as the progenitors of [[nucleotide]]s, lipids and amino acids.{{r|Hartman}}

====Last universal ancestor====
{{Main|Last universal ancestor}}
It is believed that of this multiplicity of protocells, only one [[Lineage (evolution)|line]] survived. Current [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] evidence suggests that the [[last universal ancestor]] (LUA) lived during the early [[Archean]] eon, perhaps 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga or earlier.{{r|Penny-LUCA|Munster}} This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. It was probably a [[prokaryote]], possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] or membrane-bound [[organelle]]s such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]s. Like modern cells, it used DNA as its genetic code, RNA for information transfer and [[protein synthesis]], and enzymes to [[Enzyme catalysis|catalyze reactions]]. Some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor, there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by [[lateral gene transfer]].{{r|Penny-LUCA}}

==Proterozoic Eon==
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The Proterozoic eon lasted from 2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga to 542&amp;nbsp;Ma (million years) ago.{{r|TimeScale|page1=130}} In this time span, [[cratons]] grew into continents with modern sizes. The change to an oxygen-rich atmosphere was a crucial development. Life developed from prokaryotes into [[eukaryote]]s and multicellular forms. The Proterozoic saw a couple of severe ice ages called [[snowball Earth]]s. After the last Snowball Earth about 600&amp;nbsp;Ma, the evolution of life on Earth accelerated. About 580&amp;nbsp;Ma, the [[Ediacaran biota]] formed the prelude for the [[Cambrian Explosion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Oxygen revolution===
{{Main|Great Oxygenation Event}}
{{See also|Ozone layer}}
[[File:Lake Thetis-Stromatolites-LaRuth.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lithification|Lithified]] [[stromatolite]]s on the shores of [[Lake Thetis]], [[Western Australia]]. Archean stromatolites are the first direct fossil traces of life on Earth.]]
[[File:Banded Iron Formation Barberton.jpg|thumb|A [[banded iron formation]] from the 3.15&amp;nbsp;Ga Moories Group, [[Barberton Greenstone Belt]], [[South Africa]]. Red layers represent the times when oxygen was available; gray layers were formed in anoxic circumstances.]]
The earliest cells absorbed energy and food from the surrounding environment. They used [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], the breakdown of more complex compounds into less complex compounds with less energy, and used the energy so liberated to grow and reproduce. Fermentation can only occur in an ''anaerobic'' (oxygen-free) environment. The evolution of [[photosynthesis]] made it possible for cells to derive energy from the Sun.{{r|CondieSystem|page1=377}}

Most of the life that covers the surface of the Earth depends directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. The most common form, oxygenic photosynthesis, turns carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into food. It captures the energy of sunlight in energy-rich molecules such as ATP, which then provide the energy to make sugars. To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product.{{r|Leslie}} Some organisms, including [[purple bacteria]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]], use an [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic form of photosynthesis]] that uses alternatives to hydrogen stripped from water as [[electron donors]]; examples are hydrogen sulfide, sulfur and iron. Such [[extremophile]] organisms are restricted to otherwise inhospitable environments such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents.{{r|CondieSystem|Nisbet|page1=379–382}}

The simpler anoxygenic form arose about 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga, not long after the appearance of life. The timing of oxygenic photosynthesis is more controversial; it had certainly appeared by about 2.4&amp;nbsp;Ga, but some researchers put it back as far as 3.2&amp;nbsp;Ga.{{r|Leslie}} The latter "probably increased global productivity by at least two or three orders of magnitude".{{r|De-Marais-photosynthesis|Olson-2006}} Among the oldest remnants of oxygen-producing lifeforms are fossil [[stromatolite]]s.{{r|De-Marais-photosynthesis|Olson-2006|Holland-2006}}

At first, the released oxygen was bound up with [[limestone]], [[iron]], and other minerals. The oxidized iron appears as red layers in geological strata called [[banded iron formations]] that formed in abundance during the [[Siderian]] period (between 2500&amp;nbsp;Ma and 2300&amp;nbsp;Ma).{{r|TimeScale|page1=133}} When most of the exposed readily reacting minerals were oxidized, oxygen finally began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen, the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed Earth's atmosphere to its current state. This was Earth's third atmosphere.{{r|ForteyDtL|page1=50–51|Gale|page2=83–84,116–117}}

Some oxygen was stimulated by solar ultraviolet radiation to form [[ozone]], which collected in a layer near the upper part of the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbed, and still absorbs, a significant amount of the ultraviolet radiation that once had passed through the atmosphere. It allowed cells to colonize the surface of the ocean and eventually the land: without the ozone layer, ultraviolet radiation bombarding land and sea would have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in exposed cells.{{r|cosmic-evolution-bio1|Lunine|page2=219–220}}

Photosynthesis had another major impact. Oxygen was toxic; much life on Earth probably died out as its levels rose in what is known as the ''[[oxygen catastrophe]]''. Resistant forms survived and thrived, and some developed the ability to use oxygen to increase their metabolism and obtain more energy from the same food.{{r|cosmic-evolution-bio1}}

===Snowball Earth===
{{Main|Snowball Earth}}

The [[Stellar evolution|natural evolution of the Sun]] made it progressively more [[luminosity|luminous]] during the Archean and Proterozoic eons; the Sun's luminosity increases 6% every billion years.{{r|Lunine|page1=165}} As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon. However, the Earth did not get warmer. Instead, the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early Proterozoic. [[Glacial deposit]]s found in South Africa date back to 2.2&amp;nbsp;Ga, at which time, based on [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] evidence, they must have been located near the equator. Thus, this glaciation, known as the [[Huronian glaciation]], may have been global. Some scientists suggest this was so severe that the Earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator, a hypothesis called Snowball Earth.{{r|Snowball}}

The Huronian ice age might have been caused by the [[Great Oxygenation Event|increased oxygen concentration]] in the atmosphere, which caused the decrease of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, but with oxygen it reacts to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a less effective greenhouse gas.{{r|Lunine|page1=172}} When free oxygen became available in the atmosphere, the concentration of methane could have decreased dramatically, enough to counter the effect of the increasing heat flow from the Sun.{{r|SnowballCause}}

However, the term Snowball Earth is more commonly used to describe later extreme ice ages during the [[Cryogenian]] period. There were four periods, each lasting about 10 million years, between 750 and 580 million years ago, when the earth is thought to have been covered with ice apart from the highest mountains, and average temperatures were about {{convert|-50|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Geology &amp; Earth Sciences|editor-first=Michael|editor-last=Allaby|title=Snowball Earth|page=539|edition=4th|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snowball may have been partly due to the location of the supercontintent [[Rodinia]] straddling the [[Equator]]. Carbon dioxide combines with rain to weather rocks to form carbonic acid, which is then washed out to sea, thus extracting the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. When the continents are near the poles, the advance of ice covers the rocks, slowing the reduction in carbon dioxide, but in the Cryogienian the weathering of Rodinia was able to continue unchecked until the ice advanced to the tropics. The process may have finally been reversed by the emission of carbon dioxide from volcanoes or the destabilization of methane [[gas hydrates]]. According to the alternative [[Slushball Earth]] theory, even at the height of the ice ages there was still open water at the Equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marcia|last=Bjornerud|title=Reading the Rocks: The Autobiography of the Earth|publisher=Westview Press|year=2005|pages=131–38|isbn=978-0-8133-4249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/Slushball-Earth-hypothesis|encyclopedia=Encylopædia Britannica|title=Slushball Earth hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence of eukaryotes===
{{further|Eukaryote#Origin of eukaryotes}}
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|Chloroplasts in the cells of a moss]]
Modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] classifies life into three domains. The time of their origin is uncertain. The [[Bacteria]] domain probably first split off from the other forms of life (sometimes called [[Neomura]]), but this supposition is controversial. Soon after this, by 2 Ga,{{r|SciAm-eukaryote}} the Neomura split into the [[Archaea]] and the [[Eukarya]]. Eukaryotic cells (Eukarya) are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea), and the origin of that complexity is only now becoming known. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Around this time, the first [[proto-mitochondrion]] was formed. A bacterial cell related to today's ''[[Rickettsia]]'',{{r|Andersson}} which had evolved to [[Cellular respiration|metabolize oxygen]], entered a larger prokaryotic cell, which lacked that capability. Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly due to the evolution of prey defenses). The smaller cell may have tried to [[parasite|parasitize]] the larger one. In any case, the smaller cell survived inside the larger cell. Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy. Part of this excess energy was returned to the host. The smaller cell replicated inside the larger one. Soon, a stable [[symbiosis]] developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it. Over time, the host cell acquired some genes from the smaller cells, and the two kinds became dependent on each other: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller ones, and these, in turn, could not survive without the raw materials provided by the larger cell. The whole cell is now considered a single [[organism]], and the smaller cells are classified as [[organelle]]s called mitochondria.{{r|BerkeleyEvolution}}

A similar event occurred with [[photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]]{{r|Bergland}} entering large [[heterotrophic]] cells and becoming chloroplasts.{{r|ForteyDtL|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=60–61|page2=536–539}}  Probably as a result of these changes, a line of cells capable of photosynthesis split off from the other eukaryotes more than 1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. There were probably several such inclusion events. Besides the well-established [[endosymbiotic theory]] of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to [[peroxisomes]], [[spirochete]]s led to [[cilia]] and [[flagella]], and that perhaps a [[DNA virus]] led to the cell nucleus,{{r|takemura|bell}} though none of them are widely accepted.{{r|peroxisome}}

Archaeans, bacteria, and eukaryotes continued to diversify and to become more complex and better adapted to their environments. Each domain repeatedly split into multiple lineages, although little is known about the history of the archaea and bacteria. Around 1.1 Ga, the [[supercontinent]] Rodinia was assembling.{{r|hanson-rodinia|li-rodinia}} The [[plant]], [[animal]], and [[fungi]] lines had split, though they still existed as solitary cells. Some of these lived in colonies, and gradually a [[division of labor]] began to take place; for instance, cells on the periphery might have started to assume different roles from those in the interior. Although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear, around 1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago{{r|Cosmic-evolution-bio2}}, the first multicellular plants emerged, probably [[green algae]].{{r|bhattacharya}} Possibly by around 900 Ma{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=488}} true multicellularity had also evolved in animals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

At first, it probably resembled today's [[sponge]]s, which have [[totipotent]] cells that allow a disrupted organism to reassemble itself.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=483–487}}  As the division of labor was completed in all lines of multicellular organisms, cells became more specialized and more dependent on each other; isolated cells would die.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Supercontinents in the Proterozoic===
{{Main|Supercontinent cycle}}
[[File:Positions of ancient continents, 550 million years ago.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of Pannotia (550&amp;nbsp;Ma).]]
Reconstructions of tectonic plate movement in the past 250&amp;nbsp;million years (the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras) can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles. No ocean crust dates back further than that, so earlier reconstructions are more difficult. Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as [[orogenic belt]]s, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna. The further back in time, the scarcer and harder to interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions.{{r|Kearey|page1=370}}

Throughout the history of the Earth, there have been times when continents collided and formed a supercontinent, which later broke up into new continents. About 1000 to 830&amp;nbsp;Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia.{{r|Kearey|page1=370}}{{r|Torsvik2003}} Rodinia may have been preceded by Early-Middle Proterozoic continents called Nuna and Columbia.{{r|Kearey|page1=374}}&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2=Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |date=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |issue=1–4 |pages=125–162 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2=Sun |first2=M. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Li |first4=S.Z. |date=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–123|bibcode = 2004ESRv...67...91Z |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the break-up of Rodinia about 800&amp;nbsp;Ma, the continents may have formed another short-lived supercontinent around 550&amp;nbsp;Ma. The hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes referred to as [[Pannotia|Pannotia or Vendia]].{{r|McElhinny|page1=321–322}} The evidence for it is a phase of [[continental collision]] known as the [[Pan-African orogeny]], which joined the continental masses of current-day Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. The existence of Pannotia depends on the timing of the rifting between [[Gondwana]] (which included most of the landmass now in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]) and [[Laurentia]] (roughly equivalent to current-day North America).{{r|Kearey|page1=374}} It is at least certain that by the end of the Proterozoic eon, most of the continental mass lay united in a position around the south pole.{{r|Dalziel}}

===Late Proterozoic climate and life===
[[File:Spriggina Floundensi 4.png|thumb|A 580&amp;nbsp;million year old fossil of ''[[Spriggina|Spriggina floundensi]]'', an animal from the [[Ediacaran]] period. Such life forms could have been ancestors to the many new forms that originated in the [[Cambrian Explosion]].]]
The end of the Proterozoic saw at least two Snowball Earths, so severe that the surface of the oceans may have been completely frozen. This happened about 716.5 and 635&amp;nbsp;Ma, in the [[Cryogenian period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100304142228.htm| title=Snowball Earth: New Evidence Hints at Global Glaciation 716.5 Million Years Ago |newspaper=Science Daily|date=Mar 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early Proterozoic Snowball Earth.&lt;ref name="Science Daily Snowball Earth challenged"&gt;{{cite web|title='Snowball Earth' Hypothesis Challenged|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012083450.htm|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most paleoclimatologists think the cold episodes were linked to the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt; Because Rodinia was centered on the equator, rates of [[chemical weathering]] increased and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was taken from the atmosphere. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an important greenhouse gas, climates cooled globally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
In the same way, during the Snowball Earths most of the continental surface was covered with [[permafrost]], which decreased chemical weathering again, leading to the end of the glaciations. An alternative hypothesis is that enough carbon dioxide escaped through volcanic outgassing that the resulting greenhouse effect raised global temperatures.{{r|Hoffman}} Increased volcanic activity resulted from the break-up of Rodinia at about the same time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Cryogenian period was followed by the [[Ediacaran]] period, which was characterized by a rapid development of new multicellular lifeforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080103144451.htm| title=Two Explosive Evolutionary Events Shaped Early History Of Multicellular Life|newspaper=Science Daily|date=Jan 3, 2008 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether there is a connection between the end of the severe ice ages and the increase in diversity of life is not clear, but it does not seem coincidental. The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever. Though the taxonomy of most Ediacaran life forms is unclear, some were ancestors of groups of modern life.{{r|Xiao}} Important developments were the origin of muscular and neural cells. None of the Ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons. These first appear after the boundary between the Proterozoic and [[Phanerozoic]] eons or Ediacaran and Cambrian periods.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Phanerozoic Eon==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The Phanerozoic is the current eon on Earth, which started approximately 542 million years ago. It consists of three eras: The [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]],{{r|shortTimeScale}} and is the time when multi-cellular life greatly diversified into almost all the organisms known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dynamic Earth System|last= Patwardhan|first= A.M.|date= 2010|publisher= PHI Learning Private Limited|location= New Delhi|isbn=978-81-203-4052-7|page= 146|pages= |url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=EOgZJZaA-Q0C}}|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paleozoic ("old life") era was the first and longest era of the Phanerozoic eon, lasting from 542 to 251&amp;nbsp;Ma.{{r|shortTimeScale}} During the Paleozoic, many modern groups of life came into existence. Life colonized the land, first plants, then animals. Two major extinctions occurred. The continents formed at the break-up of Pannotia and Rodinia at the end of the Proterozoic slowly moved together again, forming the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] in the late Paleozoic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Mesozoic  ("middle life") era lasted from 251&amp;nbsp;Ma to {{period start|Cenozoic}}&amp;nbsp;Ma.{{r|shortTimeScale}} It is subdivided into the [[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]], and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The era began with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the most severe extinction event in the fossil record; 95% of the species on Earth died out.{{r|bbc-permian-triassic}} It ended with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that wiped out the [[dinosaur]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

The Cenozoic ("new life") era began at {{period start|Cenozoic}}&amp;nbsp;Ma,{{r|shortTimeScale}} and is subdivided into the [[Paleogene]], [[Neogene]], and Quaternary periods.  These three periods are further split into seven sub-divisions, with the Paleogene composed of The [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], and [[Oligocene]], the Neogene divided into the [[Miocene]], [[Pliocene]], and the Quaternary composed of the [[Pleistocene]], and Holocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cenozoic/cenozoic.php |title=The Cenozoic Era |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals, birds, amphibians, crocodilians, turtles, and lepidosaurs survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs and many other forms of life, and this is the era during which they diversified into their modern forms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Tectonics, paleogeography and climate===
[[File:Pangaea continents.png|thumb|right|[[Pangaea]] was a [[supercontinent]] that existed from about 300 to 180&amp;nbsp;Ma. The outlines of the modern continents and other landmasses are indicated on this map.]]
At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, [[Baltica]], [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://evolution.berkeley.edu/glossary_entry/glossary.php?word=Pannotia | title = Pannotia | work = UCMP Glossary | accessdate = 2006-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the [[sea level]] to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short [[ice age]] during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many [[brachiopod]]s, trilobites, [[Bryozoa]] and [[coral]]s disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.{{r|bbc-ordovician}}

The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400&amp;nbsp;Ma, during the [[Caledonian Orogeny]], to form [[Laurussia]] (also known as Euramerica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Dennis C. |url=http://www.devoniantimes.org/who/pages/euramerica.html|title=The paleocontinent Euramerica|work=Devonian Times |date=May 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in [[Scandinavia]], [[Scotland]], and the northern [[Appalachia]]ns. In the [[Devonian]] period (416–359&amp;nbsp;Ma){{r|shortTimeScale}} Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the [[Uralian orogeny|Uralian Orogeny]], the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the [[Variscan Orogeny|Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny]] in Europe or the [[Alleghenian Orogeny]] in North America. The latter phase took place during the [[Carboniferous]] period (359–299&amp;nbsp;Ma){{r|shortTimeScale}} and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.{{r|Condie}}

By 180&amp;nbsp;Ma, Pangaea broke up into [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Cambrian explosion===
{{Main|Cambrian explosion}}
[[File:Elrathia kingii growth series.jpg|thumb|[[Trilobites]] first appeared during the Cambrian period and were among the most widespread and diverse groups of Paleozoic organisms.]]
The rate of the evolution of life as recorded by fossils accelerated in the [[Cambrian]] period (542–488&amp;nbsp;Ma).{{r|shortTimeScale}} The sudden emergence of many new species, [[phylum|phyla]], and forms in this period is called the Cambrian Explosion. The biological fomenting in the Cambrian Explosion was unpreceded before and since that time.{{r|Lunine|page1=229}} Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, at the end of the Cambrian most modern phyla were already present. The development of hard body parts such as shells, [[skeleton]]s or [[exoskeleton]]s in animals like [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[crinoid]]s and [[arthropod]]s (a well-known group of arthropods from the lower Paleozoic are the [[trilobite]]s) made the preservation and [[fossilization]] of such life forms easier than those of their Proterozoic ancestors. For this reason, much more is known about life in and after the Cambrian than about that of older periods. Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are seemingly quite different from modern life; examples are ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' and ''[[Haikouichthys]]''. More recently, however, these seem to have found a place in modern classification. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During the Cambrian, the first [[vertebrate]] animals, among them the first [[fishes]], had appeared.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=357}} A creature that could have been the ancestor of the fishes, or was probably closely related to it, was ''[[Pikaia]]''. It had a primitive [[notochord]], a structure that could have developed into a [[vertebral column]] later. The first fishes with [[jaw]]s ([[Gnathostomata]]) appeared during the next geological period, the [[Ordovician]]. The colonisation of new [[Ecological niche|niche]]s resulted in massive body sizes. In this way, fishes with increasing sizes evolved during the early Paleozoic, such as the titanic [[placoderm]] ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', which could grow {{convert|7|m|ft|sp=us}} long.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The diversity of life forms did not increase greatly because of a series of mass extinctions that define widespread biostratigraphic units called ''biomeres''.{{r|Runkel}}  After each extinction pulse, the [[continental shelf]] regions were repopulated by similar life forms that may have been evolving slowly elsewhere.{{r|Palmer}}  By the late Cambrian, the trilobites had reached their greatest diversity and dominated nearly all fossil assemblages.{{r|Hallam|page1=34}}

===Colonization of land===
[[File:Devonianscene-green.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of [[Devonian]] flora]]
Oxygen accumulation from photosynthesis resulted in the formation of an ozone layer that absorbed much of the Sun's [[ultraviolet radiation]], meaning unicellular organisms that reached land were less likely to die, and prokaryotes began to multiply and become better adapted to survival out of the water.

Several hundred million years ago, plants (probably resembling [[algae]]) and fungi started growing at the edges of the water, and then out of it.{{r|Fortey|page1=138–140}} The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460&amp;nbsp;Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000&amp;nbsp;Ma and the plants 700&amp;nbsp;Ma.{{r|heckman}} Initially remaining close to the water's edge, mutations and variations resulted in further colonization of this new environment. The timing of the first animals to leave the oceans is not precisely known: the oldest clear evidence is of arthropods on land around 450&amp;nbsp;Ma,{{r|johnson}} perhaps thriving and becoming better adapted due to the vast food source provided by the terrestrial plants. There is also unconfirmed evidence that arthropods may have appeared on land as early as 530 Ma.{{r|macnaughton}}

===Evolution of tetrapods===

[[File:Tiktaalik BW.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tiktaalik]]'', a fish with limb-like fins and a predecessor of tetrapods. Reconstruction from fossils about 375&amp;nbsp;million years old.]]
At the end of the Ordovician period, 443&amp;nbsp;Ma,{{r|shortTimeScale}} additional [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|extinction events]] occurred, perhaps due to a concurrent ice age.{{r|bbc-ordovician}} Around 380 to 375&amp;nbsp;Ma, the first [[tetrapod]]s evolved from fish.{{r|clack-sa}} Fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air. This would let them live in oxygen-poor water, or pursue small prey in shallow water.{{r|clack-sa}} They may have later ventured on land for brief periods. Eventually, some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land, although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs. This was the origin of the [[amphibian]]s. About 365&amp;nbsp;Ma, another [[Late Devonian extinction|period of extinction]] occurred, perhaps as a result of [[global cooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McGhee, Jr |first=George R. |date=1996 |title=The Late Devonian Mass Extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian Crisis |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-07504-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants evolved [[seed]]s, which dramatically accelerated their spread on land, around this time (by approximately 360&amp;nbsp;Ma).{{r|willis|waikato}}

About 20&amp;nbsp;million years later (340&amp;nbsp;Ma{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=293–296}}), the [[amniotic egg]] evolved, which could be laid on land, giving a survival advantage to tetrapod embryos. This resulted in the divergence of [[amniote]]s from amphibians. Another 30&amp;nbsp;million years (310&amp;nbsp;Ma{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=254–256}}) saw the divergence of the [[synapsid]]s (including mammals) from the [[sauropsid]]s (including birds and reptiles). Other groups of organisms continued to evolve, and lines diverged—in fish, insects, bacteria, and so on—but less is known of the details.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Europasaurus holgeri Scene 2.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaur]]s were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates throughout most of the [[Mesozoic]]]]
After yet another, the most severe extinction of the period (251~250&amp;nbsp;Ma), around 230&amp;nbsp;Ma, dinosaurs split off from their reptilian ancestors.{{r|bbc-new_blood}} The [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] at 200&amp;nbsp;Ma spared many of the dinosaurs,{{r|shortTimeScale|bbc-triassic}} and they soon became dominant among the vertebrates. Though some mammalian lines began to separate during this period, existing mammals were probably small animals resembling [[shrew]]s.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=169}}

The boundary between avian and non-avian dinosaurs is not clear, but ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', traditionally considered one of the first birds, lived around 150&amp;nbsp;Ma.{{r|archaeopteryx}}

The earliest evidence for the [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] evolving flowers is during the Cretaceous period, some 20&amp;nbsp;million years later (132&amp;nbsp;Ma).{{r|tol-angiosperms}}

===Extinctions===
The first of five great mass extinctions was the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction]]. Its possible cause was the intense glaciation of Gondwana, which eventually led to a [[snowball earth]]. 60% of marine invertebrates became extinct and 25% of all families.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The second mass extinction was the [[Late Devonian extinction]], probably caused by the evolution of trees, which could have led to the depletion of greenhouse gases (like CO2) or the [[eutrophication]] of water. 70% of all species became extinct.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The third mass extinction was the Permian-Triassic, or the [[Great Dying]], event was possibly caused by some combination of the [[Siberian Traps]] volcanic event, an asteroid impact, [[methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] gasification, sea level fluctuations, and a major [[anoxic event]]. Either the proposed [[Wilkes Land crater]]{{r|bbc-antarctic-crater}} in Antarctica or [[Bedout|Bedout structure]] off the northwest coast of Australia may indicate an impact connection with the Permian-Triassic extinction. But it remains uncertain whether either these or other proposed Permian-Triassic boundary craters are either real impact craters or even contemporaneous with the Permian-Triassic extinction event. This was by far the deadliest extinction ever, with about 57% of all [[Family (biology)|families]] and 83% of all [[genus|genera]] killed.&lt;ref name="Benton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benton M J|authorlink = Michael Benton|title=When life nearly died: the greatest mass extinction of all time |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-500-28573-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BergstromDugatkin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl T.

The fourth mass extinction was the [[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event]] in which almost all [[synapsids]] and [[archosaurs]] became extinct, probably due to new competition from dinosaurs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The fifth and most recent mass extinction was the [[K-T extinction]]. In 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, a {{convert|10|km|adj=on|sp=us}} [[asteroid]] struck Earth just off the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] – somewhere in the south western tip of then Laurasia – where the [[Chicxulub crater]] is today. This ejected vast quantities of particulate matter and vapor into the air that occluded sunlight, inhibiting photosynthesis. 75% of all life, including the non-avian dinosaurs, became extinct,{{r|cosmic-evolution-bio4}} marking the end of the Cretaceous period and Mesozoic era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Diversification of mammals===
{{dablink|Further information: [[Evolution of mammals]]}}
The first true mammals evolved in the shadows of dinosaurs and other large archosaurs that filled the world by the late Triassic. The first mammals were very small, and were probably nocturnal to escape predation. Mammal diversification truly began only after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Strauss|title=The First Mammals:The Early Mammals of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods|website=about.com |url=http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/otherprehistoriclife/a/earlymammals.htm|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early Paleocene the earth recovered from the extinction, and mammalian diversity increased. Creatures like ''[[Ambulocetus]]'' took to the oceans to eventually evolve into whales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/news-posts/a-walking-whale-ambulocetus |title=A Walking Whale: Ambulocetus |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some creatures, like primates, took to the trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/earlyprimates/early_2.htm |title=Early Primate Evolution: The First Primates |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |publisher=Palomar College |date=2012 |accessdate=2016-01-10 |df= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225115518/http://anthro.palomar.edu/earlyprimates/early_2.htm |archivedate=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This all changed during the mid to late Eocene when the circum-Antarctic current formed between Antarctica and Australia which disrupted weather patterns on a global scale.  Grassless [[savanna]]s began to predominate much of the landscape, and mammals such as ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' rose up to become the largest known terrestrial predatory mammal ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/on-exhibit-posts/andrewsarchus-superb-skull-of-a-gigantic-beast |title=Andrewsarchus, "Superb Skull of a Gigantic Beast," Now on View in Whales Exhibit |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Archaeoceti|early whales]] like ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' took control of the seas. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The evolution of [[grass]] brought a remarkable change to the Earth's landscape, and the new open spaces created pushed mammals to get bigger and bigger. Grass started to expand in the Miocene, and the Miocene is where many modern- day mammals first appeared. Giant [[ungulates]] like ''[[Paraceratherium]]'' and ''[[Deinotherium]]'' evolved to rule the grasslands. The evolution of grass also brought [[primate]]s down from the trees, and started [[human evolution]]. The first big cats evolved during this time as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Dvorsky |url=http://io9.com/the-worlds-first-big-cats-came-from-asia-not-africa-1463616060 |title=The world's first big cats came from Asia, not Africa |publisher=Io9.com |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tethys Sea]] was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.clim-past.net/9/2687/2013/cp-9-2687-2013.pdf |title=The role of eastern Tethys seaway closure in the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition (ca. 14 Ma) |first1=N. |last1=Hamon |first2=P. |last2=Sepulchre |first3=V. |last3=Lefebvre |first4=G. |last4=Ramstein |journal=Climate of the Past |date=2013 |volume=9 |pages=2687–2702 |accessdate=2016-01-10 |doi=10.5194/cp-9-2687-2013|bibcode = 2013CliPa...9.2687H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Panama was perhaps the most important geological event to occur in the last 60 million years. Atlantic and Pacific currents were closed off from each other, which caused the formation of the [[Gulf Stream]], which made Europe warmer. The land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of South America to migrate over to North America, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=4073|title=Isthmus of Panama|author=N.A.S.A.|work=N.A.S.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various species migrated south, leading to the presence in South America of [[llama]]s, the [[spectacled bear]], [[kinkajou]]s and [[jaguar]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Three million years ago saw the start of the Pleistocene epoch, which featured dramatic climactic changes due to the ice ages. The ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in Saharan Africa and expansion. The mega-fauna that dominated fed on grasslands that, by now, had taken over much of the subtropical world. The large amounts of water held in the ice allowed for various bodies of water to shrink and sometimes disappear such as the North Sea and the Bering Strait. It is believed by many that a huge migration took place along [[Beringia]] which is why, today, there are [[camels]] (which evolved and became extinct in North America), [[horses]] (which evolved and became extinct in North America), and Native Americans. The ending of the last ice age coincided with the expansion of man, along with a massive die out of ice age mega-fauna. This extinction, nicknamed "[[Holocene extinction|the Sixth Extinction]]", has been going ever since.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Human evolution===
{{Human timeline}}
{{Main|Human evolution}}
A small African ape living around 6&amp;nbsp;Ma was the last animal whose descendants would include both modern humans and their closest relatives, the [[chimpanzee]]s.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=100–101}} Only two branches of its family tree have surviving descendants. Very soon after the split, for reasons that are still unclear, apes in one branch developed the ability to [[bipedal|walk upright]].{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=95–99}} [[Brain]] size increased rapidly, and by 2&amp;nbsp;Ma, the first animals classified in the genus ''[[Homo]]'' had appeared.{{r|Fortey|page1=300}} Of course, the line between different species or even genera is somewhat arbitrary as organisms continuously change over generations. Around the same time, the other branch split into the ancestors of the [[common chimpanzee]] and the ancestors of the [[bonobo]] as evolution continued simultaneously in all life forms.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=100–101}}

The ability to control [[fire]] probably began in ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (or ''[[Homo ergaster]]''), probably at least 790,000&amp;nbsp;years ago{{r|goren-inbar}} but perhaps as early as 1.5&amp;nbsp;Ma.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=67}} The use and discovery of controlled fire may even predate ''Homo erectus''. Fire was possibly used by the early [[Lower Paleolithic]] (Oldowan) hominid ''[[Homo habilis]]'' or strong [[australopithecine]]s such as ''[[Paranthropus]].''{{r|McClellan}}
[[File:Human evolution chart-en.svg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of human history based on fossil data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=David L.|display-authors=4|author2=Smith, Vincent S. |author3=Hammond, Shaless L. |author4=Rogers, Alan R. |author5= Clayton, Dale H. |title=Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2004|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e340|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340|pmid=15502871|pmc=521174}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It is more difficult to establish the [[origin of language]]; it is unclear whether ''Homo erectus'' could speak or if that capability had not begun until ''Homo sapiens''.{{r|Dawkins-Ancestors|page1=67}} As brain size increased, babies were born earlier, before their heads grew too large to pass through the [[pelvis]]. As a result, they exhibited more [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]], and thus possessed an increased capacity to learn and required a longer period of dependence. Social skills became more complex, language became more sophisticated, and tools became more elaborate. This contributed to further cooperation and intellectual development.{{r|McNeill|page1=7}} Modern humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') are believed to have originated around 200,000&amp;nbsp;years ago or earlier [[single-origin hypothesis|in Africa]]; the oldest fossils date back to around 160,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.{{r|gibbons}}

The first humans to show signs of [[spirituality]] are the [[Neanderthal]]s (usually classified as a separate species with no surviving descendants); they buried their dead, often with no sign of food or tools.{{r|hopfe|page1=17}} However, evidence of more sophisticated beliefs, such as the early [[Cro-Magnon]] [[cave painting]]s (probably with magical or religious significance){{r|hopfe|page1=17–19}} did not appear until 32,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.{{r|Chauvet}} Cro-Magnons also left behind stone figurines such as [[Venus of Willendorf]], probably also signifying religious belief.{{r|hopfe|page1=17–19}} By 11,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, ''Homo sapiens'' had reached the southern tip of [[South America]], the last of the uninhabited continents (except for Antarctica, which remained undiscovered until 1820 AD).{{r|oxford-atlas}} Tool use and communication continued to improve, and interpersonal relationships became more intricate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vitruvian Man]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] epitomizes the advances in art and science seen during the Renaissance.]]
Throughout more than 90% of its history, ''Homo sapiens'' lived in small bands as [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s.{{r|McNeill|page1=8}} As language became more complex, the ability to remember and communicate information resulted, according to a theory proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]], in a new replicator: the [[meme]].{{r|dawkins-sg}} Ideas could be exchanged quickly and passed down the generations. [[Cultural evolution]] quickly outpaced [[Evolution|biological evolution]], and [[history]] proper began. Between 8500 and 7000 [[Before Christ|BC]], humans in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Middle East]] began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals: [[agriculture]].{{r|Tudge}} This spread to neighboring regions, and developed independently elsewhere, until most ''Homo sapiens'' lived sedentary lives in permanent settlements as farmers. Not all societies abandoned nomadism, especially those in isolated areas of the globe poor in [[Domestication|domesticable]] plant species, such as [[Australia]].{{r|diamond}} However, among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture, the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Agriculture had a major impact; humans began to affect the environment as never before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing [[Division of labour|division of labor]]. This led to Earth's [[first civilization]] at [[Sumer]] in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC.{{r|McNeill|page1=15}} Additional civilizations quickly arose in [[ancient Egypt]], at the [[Indus Valley civilization|Indus River valley]] and in China. The invention of [[writing]] enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and [[library|libraries]] served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including [[science]] (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.

By around 500 BC, there were advanced civilizations in the Middle East, Iran, India, China, and Greece, at times expanding, at times entering into decline.{{r|McNeill|page1=3}} In 221 BC, [[China]] became a single polity that would grow to spread its culture throughout [[East Asia]], and it has remained the most populous nation in the world. The fundamentals of [[Western civilization]] were largely shaped in [[Ancient Greece]], with the world's first [[democracy|democratic government]] and major advances in philosophy, science, and mathematics, and in [[Ancient Rome]] in law, government, and engineering.&lt;ref name="Daly2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Daly|title=The Rise of Western Power: A Comparative History of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aZPAQAAQBAJ|date=19 December 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-1851-6|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Empire]] was [[Religion in ancient Rome#History of Roman religion#Roman Empire#Christianization|Christianized by Emperor Constantine]] in the early 4th century and [[Decline of the Roman Empire|declined]] by the end of the 5th. Beginning with the 7th century, [[Christianization#Christianization of Europe (7th-15th centuries)|Christianization of Europe]] began. In 610, [[Islam]] was founded and quickly became the dominant religion in [[Western Asia]]. The [[House of Wisdom]] was established in [[Abbasid]]-era [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bayt-al-Hikmah|title=Bayt al-Hikmah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|access-date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], where [[Muslim scholars]] in [[Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]] flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the [[Mongol sack of Baghdad]] in 1258 AD. In 1054 AD the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] led to the prominent cultural differences between [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In the 14th century, the [[Renaissance]] began in [[Italy]] with advances in religion, art, and science.{{r|McNeill|page1=317–319}} At that time the Christian Church as a political entity lost much of its power. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the Americas, initiating great changes to the [[new world]]. European civilization began to change beginning in 1500, leading to the [[Scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] revolutions.  That continent began to exert political and cultural [[Hegemony|dominance]] over human societies around the world, a time known as the [[History of colonialism|Colonial era]] (also see [[Age of Discovery]]).{{r|McNeill|page1=295–299}} In the 18th century a cultural movement known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]] further shaped the mentality of Europe and contributed to its [[secularization]]. From 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945, nations around the world were embroiled in [[world war]]s. Established following [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] was a first step in establishing international institutions to settle disputes peacefully. After failing to prevent [[World War II]], mankind's bloodiest conflict, it was replaced by the [[United Nations]]. After the war, many new states were formed, declaring or being granted independence in a period of [[decolonization]]. The [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] became the world's dominant [[superpower]]s for a time, and they held an often-violent rivalry known as the [[Cold War]] until the dissolution of the latter. In 1992, several European nations joined in the [[European Union]]. As transportation and communication improved, the economies and political affairs of nations around the world have become increasingly intertwined. This [[globalization]] has often produced both conflict and cooperation.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32567">An '''integrated gasification combined cycle''' ('''IGCC''') is a technology that uses a high pressure gasifier to turn [[coal]] and other carbon based fuels into pressurized gas—synthesis gas ([[syngas]]). It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, can be turned into re-usable byproducts through the [[Claus process]]. This results in lower emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], particulates, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and in some cases [[carbon dioxide]]. With additional process equipment, a [[water-gas shift reaction]] can increase gasification efficiency and reduce [[carbon monoxide]] emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide.  The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a [[steam cycle]], similar to a [[combined cycle gas turbine]]. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion.

==Significance==
Coal can be found in abundance in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]] - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of global electricity generation. Fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large-scale, detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue, especially in light of the [[Paris Agreement]]. In particular, coal contains more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per BTU than oil or natural gas and is responsible for 43% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fuel combustion. Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is discussed as a way to addressing aforementioned concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padurean|first1=Anamaria|title=Pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture by gas–liquid absorption for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants|journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control|date=5 July 2011|volume=7|pages=1–11|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Calin-Cristian_Cormos/publication/271560078_Pre-combustion_carbon_dioxide_capture_by_gasliquid_absorption_for_Integrated_Gasification_Combined_Cycle_power_plants/links/55c8621d08aebc967df89b04.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2016|doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2011.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Below is a schematic flow diagram of an IGCC plant:
[[Image:IGCC diagram.svg|thumb|center|800px|Block diagram of IGCC power plant, which utilizes the [[HRSG]]]]

The gasification process can produce [[syngas]] from a wide variety of carbon-containing feedstocks, such as high-sulfur coal, heavy petroleum residues, and [[biomass]].

The plant is called ''integrated'' because (1) the syngas produced in the gasification section is used as fuel for the gas turbine in the combined cycle and (2) the steam produced by the syngas coolers in the gasification section is used by the steam turbine in the combined cycle.
In this example the syngas produced is used as fuel in a gas turbine which produces electrical power.  In a normal combined cycle, so-called "waste heat" from the gas turbine exhaust is used in a [[Heat Recovery Steam Generator]] (HRSG) to make steam for the steam turbine cycle.  An IGCC plant improves the overall process efficiency by adding the higher-temperature steam produced by the gasification process to the steam turbine cycle.  This steam is then used in steam turbines to produce additional electrical power.

IGCC plants are advantageous in comparison to conventional coal power plants due to their high thermal efficiency, low non-carbon greenhouse gas emissions, and capability to process low grade coal. The disadvantages include higher capital and maintenance costs, and the amount of CO2 released without pre-combustion capture.&lt;ref name="Padurean2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padurean|first1=Anamaria|title=Pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture by gas–liquid absorption for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants|journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control|date=5 July 2011|volume=7|page=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Calin-Cristian_Cormos/publication/271560078_Pre-combustion_carbon_dioxide_capture_by_gasliquid_absorption_for_Integrated_Gasification_Combined_Cycle_power_plants/links/55c8621d08aebc967df89b04.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2016|doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2011.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process overview==

* The solid coal is gasified to produce syngas, or synthetic gas. Syngas is synthesized by gasifying coal in a closed pressurized reactor with a shortage of oxygen. The shortage of oxygen ensures that coal is broken down by the heat and pressure as opposed to burning completely. The chemical reaction between coal and oxygen produces a product that is a mixture of carbon and hydrogen, or syngas. C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; + (x/2)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (x)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + (y/2)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* The heat from the production of syngas is used to produce steam from cooling water which is then used for [[steam turbine]] electricity production. 
* The syngas must go through a pre-combustion separation process to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other impurities to produce a more purified fuel. Three steps are necessary for the separation of impurities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Jennie C.|title=Coupling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture and Storage with Coal Gasification: Defining "Sequestration-Ready" IGCC|journal=Energy Technology Innovation Project, Harvard University|date=May 2, 2005|url=https://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/05/carbon-seq/Tech%20Session%20Paper%20144.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Water-gas shift reaction|Water-gas-shift reaction]]. The reaction that occurs in a water-gas-shift reactor is CO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This produces a syngas with a higher composition of hydrogen fuel which is more efficient for burning later in combustion. 
# Physical separation process. This can be done through various mechanisms such as absorption, adsorption or membrane separation. 
# Drying, compression and storage/shipping.
* The resulting syngas fuels a [[combustion turbine]] that produces electricity. At this stage the syngas is fairly pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A major drawback of using coal as a fuel source is the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and particulates. Almost all coal-fired power plants use pulverized coal combustion, which grinds the coal to increase the surface area, burns it to make steam, and runs the steam through a turbine to generate electricity. Pulverized coal plants can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted and harder to separate. In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion. Syngas cleanup includes filters to remove bulk particulates, scrubbing to remove fine particulates, and solid adsorbents for mercury removal. Additionally, hydrogen gas is used as fuel, which produces no pollutants under combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syngas Composition for IGCC|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/syngas-composition-igcc|website=National Energy Technology Laboratory|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGCC also consumes less water than traditional pulverized coal plants. In a pulverized coal plant, coal is burned to produce steam, which is then used to create electricity using a steam turbine. Then steam exhaust must then be condensed with cooling water, and water is lost by evaporation. In IGCC, water consumption is reduced by combustion in a gas turbine, which uses the generated heat to expand air and drive the turbine. Steam is only used to capture the heat from the combustion turbine exhaust for use in a secondary steam turbine. Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production.

The DOE Clean Coal Demonstration Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/cleancoal/|title=Clean Coal Research {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.fossil.energy.gov|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped construct 3 IGCC plants: Edwarsport Power Station in [[Edwardsport, Indiana]], Polk Power Station in [[Tampa, Florida]] (online 1996), and Pinon Pine in [[Reno, Nevada]].  In the Reno demonstration project, researchers found that then-current IGCC technology would not work more than 300 feet (100m) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Joe Lucas, Executive Director of Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, as interviewed on NPR's Science Friday, Friday May 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE report in reference 3 however makes no mention of any altitude effect, and most of the problems were associated with the solid waste extraction system. The Wabash River and Polk Power stations are currently operating, following resolution of demonstration start-up problems, but the Piñon Pine project encountered significant problems and was abandoned.

The US DOE's Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI Phase 2) selected the [[Kemper Project]] as one of two projects to demonstrate the feasibility of low emission coal-fired power plants. [[Mississippi Power]] began construction on the [[Kemper Project]] in Kemper County, Mississippi, in 2010 and is poised to begin operation in 2016, though there have been many delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlissel|first1=David|title=The Kemper IGCC Project: Cost and Schedule Risks.|url=http://www.ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kemper-IGCC-Project-Cost-and-Schedule-Risk-Report.pdf|publisher=The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, the projected date was further pushed back from early 2016 to August 31, 2016, adding $110 million to the total and putting the project 3 years behind schedule. The electrical plant is a flagship [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] (CCS) project that burns [[lignite]] coal and utilizes pre-combustion IGCC technology with a projected 65% emission capture rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kemper County IGCC Fact Sheet: Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Project|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/kemper.html|website=Caron Capture &amp; Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|publisher=MIT|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of IGCC plants polluted less than contemporary coal-based technology, but also polluted water; for example, the Wabash River Plant was out of compliance with its water permit during 1998–2001&lt;ref&gt;

IGCC is now touted as ''capture ready'' and could potentially be used to capture and store carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236113005863 |title=Simulation of the integration of a bitumen upgrading facility and an IGCC process with carbon capture |author= El Gemayel, Jimmy |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30 |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2013.06.045 |volume=117 |journal=Fuel |pages=1288–1297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gepower.com/prod_serv/products/gasification/en/app_power.htm |title=Products &amp; Services |publisher=Gepower.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[FutureGen]])Poland's Kędzierzyn will soon host a [[Kedzierzyn Zero-Emission Plant|Zero-Emission Power &amp; Chemical Plant]] that combines coal gasification technology with [[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon Capture &amp; Storage]] (CCS). This installation had been planned, but there has been no information about it since 2009. Other operating IGCC plants in existence around the world are the Alexander (formerly Buggenum) in the Netherlands, Puertollano in Spain, and JGC in Japan.

The Texas Clean Energy project plans to build a 400 MW IGCC facility that will incorporate carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology. The project will be the first coal power plant in the United States to combine IGCC and 90% carbon capture and storage. Commercial operation is due to start in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.texascleanenergyproject.com/ |title=Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon capture and various variations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fred |first=Dr |url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/integrated-gasification-combined-cycle-for-carbon-capture-storage.html |title=Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) for Carbon Capture &amp; Storage &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;


 
==Cost and reliability==
A key issue in implementing IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC comes from the ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized cost of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh. The levelized cost of electricity was noticeably sensitive to the price of natural gas and the inclusion of carbon storage and transport costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Edward|title=Cost and performance of fossil fuel power plants with CO2 capture and storage|journal=Energy Policy|date=26 April 2007|volume=35|pages=4444–4454|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.03.009|url=https://www.cmu.edu/epp/iecm/IECM_Publications/2007b%20Rubin%20et%20al,%20Energy%20Policy%20(Mar).pdf|accessdate=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525004823/http://www.cmu.edu/epp/iecm/IECM_Publications/2007b%20Rubin%20et%20al,%20Energy%20Policy%20(Mar).pdf|archive-date=2010-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential benefit of retrofitting has so far, not offset the cost of IGCC with carbon capture technology. A 2013 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration demonstrates that the overnight cost of IGCC with CCS has increased 19% since 2010. Amongst the three power plant types, pulverized coal with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $5,227 (2012 dollars)/kW, IGCC with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $6,599 (2012 dollars)/kW, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $2,095 (2012 dollars)/kW. Pulverized coal and [[NGCC]] costs did not change significantly since 2010. The report further relates that the 19% increase in IGCC cost is due to recent information from IGCC projects that have gone over budget and cost more than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Updated Capital Cost Estimates for Utility Scale Electricity Generating Plants|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/capitalcost/#6|website=U.S. Energy Information Administration|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent testimony in regulatory proceedings show the cost of IGCC to be twice that predicted by Goddell, from $96 to 104/MWhr.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr. Elion Amit, Minnesota Dept. of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mncoalgasplant.com/puc/05-1993%20pub%20rebuttal.pdf |title=State of Minnesota : Office of the Attorney General |publisher=Mncoalgasplant.com |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That's before addition of carbon capture and sequestration (sequestration has been a [[mature technology]] at both Weyburn in Canada (for [[enhanced oil recovery]]) and Sleipner in the North Sea at a commercial scale for the past ten years)—capture at a 90% rate is expected to have a $30/MWh additional cost.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183345/http://www.prajhipurity.net/?p=list&amp;t=insightnote&amp;sp=1&amp;f=sectors%2Cccs%2Fpublish%2CYes%2F&amp;sort=2&amp;id=1766&lt;/ref&gt;

Wabash River was down repeatedly for long stretches due to gasifier problems.  The gasifier problems have not been remedied—subsequent projects, such as Excelsior's Mesaba Project, have a third gasifier and train built in.  However, the past year has seen Wabash River running reliably, with availability comparable to or better than other technologies.

The Polk County IGCC has design problems.  First, the project was initially shut down because of corrosion in the slurry pipeline that fed slurried coal from the rail cars into the gasifier.  A new coating for the pipe was developed.  Second, the thermocoupler was replaced in less than two years; an indication that the gasifier had problems with a variety of feedstocks; from bituminous to sub-bituminous coal.  The gasifier was designed to also handle lower rank lignites.  Third, unplanned down time on the gasifier because of refractory liner problems, and those problems were expensive to repair.  The gasifier was originally designed in Italy to be half the size of what was built at Polk.  Newer ceramic materials may assist in improving gasifier performance and longevity.  Understanding the operating problems of the current IGCC plant is necessary to improve the design for the IGCC plant of the future.

This is an unpublished paper from Harvard University)

General Electric is currently designing an IGCC model plant that should introduce greater reliability. GE's model features advanced turbines optimized for the coal syngas. Eastman's industrial gasification plant in Kingsport, TN uses a GE Energy solid-fed gasifier. Eastman, a fortune 500 company, built the facility in 1983 without any state or federal subsidies and turns a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Goodell, Jeff. "Big Coal." New York, Houghton Mifflin. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastman.com/ |title=Eastman Chemical Company - The results of insight™ |publisher=Eastman.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several refinery-based IGCC plants in Europe that have demonstrated good availability (90-95%) after initial shakedown periods.  Several factors help this performance:

# None of these facilities use advanced technology (''F'' type) gas turbines.
# All refinery-based plants use refinery residues, rather than coal, as the feedstock. This eliminates coal handling and coal preparation equipment and its problems.  Also, there is a much lower level of ash produced in the gasifier, which reduces cleanup and downtime in its gas cooling and cleaning stages.
# These non-utility plants have recognized the need to treat the gasification system as an up-front chemical processing plant, and have reorganized their operating staff accordingly.

Another IGCC success story has been the 250 MW Buggenum plant in The Netherlands, which was commissioned in 1994 and closed in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/nuon|title=nuon {{!}} netl.doe.gov|website=www.netl.doe.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, had good availability.  This coal-based IGCC plant was originally designed to use up to 30% biomass as a supplemental feedstock.  The owner, NUON, was paid an incentive fee by the government to use the biomass.  NUON has constructed a 1,311&amp;nbsp;MW IGCC plant in the Netherlands, comprising three 437 MW STEG units. The Nuon Magnum IGCC power plant was commissioned in 2011, and was officially opened in June 2013. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been awarded to construct the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuon.com/about-nuon/Innovative-projects/magnum.jsp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015025223/http://www.nuon.com/about-nuon/Innovative-projects/magnum.jsp |date=October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a deal with environmental organizations, NUON has been prohibited from using the Magnum plant to burn coal and biomass, until 2020. Because of high gas prices in the Netherlands, two of the three units are currently offline, whilst the third unit sees only low usage levels. The relatively low 59% efficiency of the Magnum plant means that more efficient CCGT plants (such as the Hemweg 9 plant) are preferred to provide (backup) power.

A new generation of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although none is yet under construction. Projects are being developed by [[American Electric Power|AEP]], [[Duke Energy]], and [[Southern Company]] in the US, and in Europe by [[Kedzierzyn Zero-Emission Plant|ZAK/PKE]], [[Centrica]] (UK), [[E.ON]] and RWE (both Germany) and NUON (Netherlands). In Minnesota, the state's Dept. of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not significantly better than pulverized coal. In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results.

The high cost of IGCC is the biggest obstacle to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority it seems likely that with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.)[20] also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Edward|title=Cost and performance of fossil fuel power plants with CO2 capture and storage|journal=Energy Policy|date=26 April 2007|volume=34|pages=4444–4454|url=https://www.cmu.edu/epp/iecm/IECM_Publications/2007b%20Rubin%20et%20al,%20Energy%20Policy%20(Mar).pdf|accessdate=5 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.03.009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525004823/http://www.cmu.edu/epp/iecm/IECM_Publications/2007b%20Rubin%20et%20al,%20Energy%20Policy%20(Mar).pdf|archive-date=2010-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs and Challenges of CCS|url=http://www.fossiltransition.org/pages/costs_and_challenges/136.php|website=Clear Air Task Force|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, electric power companies, in conjunction with [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] has been operating a 200 t/d IGCC pilot plant since the early '90s.  In September 2007, they started up a 250&amp;nbsp;MW demo plant in Nakoso. It runs on air-blown (not oxygen) dry feed coal only.  It burns PRB coal with an unburned carbon content ratio of &lt;0.1% and no detected leaching of trace elements. It employs not only ''F'' type turbines but ''G'' type as well. (see gasification.org link below)

Next generation IGCC plants with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture technology will be expected to have higher thermal efficiency and to hold the cost down because of simplified systems compared to conventional IGCC. The main feature is that instead of using oxygen and nitrogen to gasify coal, they use oxygen and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The main advantage is that it is possible to improve the performance of cold gas efficiency and to reduce the unburned carbon (char).

As a reference for powerplant efficiency:
* With Frame E gas turbine, 30bar quench gas cooling, Cold Temperature Gas Cleaning and 2 level HRSC it is possible to achieve around 38% energy efficiency.
* With Frame F gas turbine, 60 bar quench gasifier, Cold Temperature Gas Cleaning and 3 level+RH HRSC it is possible to achieve around 45% energy efficiency.
* Latest development of Frame G gas turbines, ASU air integration, High temperature desulfurization may shift up performance even further.&lt;ref&gt;Analisi Termodinamica di cicli Igcc avanzati, G.Lozza P.Chiesa, Politecnico di Milano, ati2000 conference proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extracted from gas turbine exhaust gas is utilized in this system. Using a closed gas turbine system capable of capturing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by direct compression and liquefication obviates the need for a separation and capture system.&lt;ref&gt;Inumaru, Jun - senior research scientist, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI)(Japan) G8 Energy Ministerial Meeting Symposium, Nikkei Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt;

== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture in IGCC ==
Pre-combustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal is much easier than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal from flue gas in post-combustion capture due to the high concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=Robert|title=Pre-combustion capture of CO2 in IGCC plants|journal=Profiles-IEA Clean Coal Centre|date=December 2011|url=http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/documents/82847/8346/Pre-combustion-capture-of-CO2-in-IGCC-plants-CCC/191|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as [[Selexol]] and [[Rectisol]], are preferred for the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents is the need for the syngas to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;

==Testing==
National and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test IGCC Power Plants. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the plant and associated systems. In the United States, [[ASME|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] published the Performance Test Code for IGCC Power Generation Plants (PTC 47) in 2006 which provides procedures for the determination of quantity and quality of fuel gas by its flow rate, temperature, pressure, composition, heating value, and its content of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-47-2006-integrated-gasification-combined |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054453/https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-47-2006-integrated-gasification-combined |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IGCC emission controversy==
In 2007, the New York State Attorney General's office demanded full disclosure of "financial risks from greenhouse gases" to the shareholders of electric power companies proposing the development of IGCC coal-fired power plants. "Any one of the several new or likely regulatory initiatives for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants - including state carbon controls, EPA's regulations under the Clean Air Act, or the enactment of federal global warming legislation - would add a significant cost to carbon-intensive coal generation";&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwire.com/mw/rel_us_print.jsp?id=776699{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] from New York has proposed that this full risk disclosure be required of all publicly traded power companies nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/files/pdf/poweringamericasfuture.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124001602/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/files/pdf/poweringamericasfuture.pdf |date=January 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This honest disclosure has begun to reduce investor interest in all types of existing-technology coal-fired power plant development, including IGCC.

Senator [[Harry Reid]] (Majority Leader of the 2007/2008 U.S. Senate) told the 2007 Clean Energy Summit that he will do everything he can to stop construction of proposed new IGCC coal-fired electric power plants in Nevada. Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in [[solar energy]], [[wind energy]] and [[geothermal energy]] instead of coal technologies. Reid stated that [[global warming]] is a reality, and just one proposed coal-fired plant would contribute to it by burning seven million tons of coal a year.  The long-term [[healthcare]] costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed). "I'm going to do everything I can to stop these plants.", he said. "There is no [[clean coal technology]]. There is cleaner coal technology, but there is no clean coal technology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicutilities.utah.gov/news/cleanenergysummitreidopposescoal.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721072632/http://publicutilities.utah.gov/news/cleanenergysummitreidopposescoal.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most efficient ways to treat the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas from an IGCC plant is by converting it into sulphuric acid in a wet gas sulphuric acid process [[Wet sulfuric acid process|WSA process]]. However, the majority of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S treating plants utilize the modified Claus process, as the sulphur market infrastructure and the transportation costs of sulphuric acid versus sulphur are in favour of sulphur production.

[[File:Representation of Lake of Wada.jpg|thumb|Representation of Lake of Wada]]
In [[mathematics]], the {{nihongo|'''lakes of Wada'''|和田の湖|Wada no mizuumi}} are three [[disjoint set|disjoint]] [[connected set|connected]] [[open set]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or open unit square with the [[counterintuitive]] property that they all have the same [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. In other words, for any point selected on the boundary of ''one'' of the lakes, the other two lakes' boundaries also contain that point.

More than two sets with the same boundary are said to have the '''Wada property'''; examples include '''Wada basins''' in [[dynamical system]]s. This property is rare in real-world systems.

The lakes of Wada were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Kunizo Yoneyama|first=Kunizō|last= Yoneyama|year= 1917|loc=page 60}}, who credited the discovery to [[Takeo Wada]]. His construction is similar to the construction by {{harvtxt|Brouwer|1910}} of an [[indecomposable continuum]], and in fact it is possible for the common boundary of the three sets to be an indecomposable continuum.

==Construction of the lakes of Wada==
[[Image:Lakes of Wada.jpg|thumb|243px|right|First five stages of the Lakes of Wada]]

The Lakes of Wada are formed by starting with a closed unit square of dry land, and then digging 3 lakes according to the following rule:
*On day ''n'' = 1, 2, 3,... extend lake ''n'' mod 3 (=0, 1, 2) so that it is open and connected and passes within a distance 1/''n'' of all remaining dry land. This should be done so that the remaining dry land remains homeomorphic to a closed unit square.

After an infinite number of days, the three lakes are still disjoint connected open sets, and the remaining dry land is the boundary of each of the 3 lakes.

For example, the first five days might be (see the image on the right):
# Dig a blue lake of width 1/3 passing within {{radic|2}}/3 of all dry land.
# Dig a red lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Dig a green lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Extend the blue lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The small channel connects the thin blue lake to the thick one, near the middle of the image.)
# Extend the red lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The tiny channel connects the thin red lake to the thick one, near the top left of the image.)

A variation of this construction can produce a countable infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary: instead of extending the lakes in the order 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...., extend them in the order 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...and so on.

==Wada basins==
[[Image:Newtroot 1 0 0 m1.png|thumb|200px|right|Wada basins of attraction for {{nowrap|z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 {{=}} 0;}} all three disconnected open basins have the same boundary]]
Wada basins are certain special [[basins of attraction]] studied in the [[mathematics]] of non-linear systems. A basin having the property that every neighborhood of every point on the boundary of that basin intersects at least three basins is called a '''Wada basin''', or said to have the '''Wada property'''. Unlike the Lakes of Wada, Wada basins are often disconnected.

An example of Wada basins is given by the [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]] applied to a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, such as {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1;}} see the picture.

A physical system that demonstrates Wada basins is the pattern of reflections between three spheres in contact—see [[chaotic scattering]].

==Wada basins in chaos theory==
In [[chaos theory]], Wada basins arise very frequently. Usually, the Wada property can be seen in the  basin of attraction of dissipative dynamical systems. 
But the exit basins of Hamiltonian system can also show the Wada property. In the context of the chaotic scattering of systems with multiple exit, basin of exit shows the Wada property. 
[[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|M. A. F. Sanjuán]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wada basins and chaotic invariant sets in the  Henon-Heiles system, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066208 (2001) |url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v64/i6/e066208}}&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that in the [[Hénon-Heiles equation|Henon-Heiles system]] the exit basins have this Wada property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136228">This is a list of [[molecule]]s that have been detected in the [[interstellar medium]] and [[circumstellar envelope]]s, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. The [[chemical formula]] is listed for each detected compound, along with any ionized form that has also been observed.

==Detection==
The molecules listed below were detected by [[spectroscopy]]. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component [[electron]]s between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in [[radio]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=shu82/&gt;

Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often as the result of an interaction with a [[cosmic ray]]. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name=pnas103d/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name=brown_pais95/&gt;

===History===
The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the [[Universe]] was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |arxiv=1312.0613|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first carbon-containing molecule detected in the interstellar medium was the [[methylidyne radical]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1937.&lt;ref name=woon05/&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of more complex organic molecules (COMs),&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fred Hoyle]] and Chandra Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175&amp;nbsp;Å,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200Å interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.

In 2004, scientists reported&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S.|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; detecting the [[spectral signature]]s of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] in the [[ultraviolet light]] emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|date=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537–549|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt; that since they discovered [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2010, [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]") were detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39|title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae|last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

In October 2011, scientists found using [[spectroscopy]] that [[cosmic dust]] contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow|first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars|url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwok|first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/nature10542 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K|pmid=22031328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of [[coal]] and [[petroleum]]; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;  These observations suggest that organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles could serve as basic ingredients for life due to their [[catalysis|surface-catalytic]] activities.&lt;ref name=Lincei&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gallori |first=Enzo |title=Astrochemistry and the origin of genetic material |journal=Rendiconti Lincei |date=November 2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=113–118 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x332837483630g24/ |accessdate=2011-08-11 |doi=10.1007/s12210-011-0118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Zita |title=Organic Chemistry of Carbonaceous Meteorites |journal=Elements |date =February 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=35–40|id=|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/1/35 |accessdate=2011-08-11|doi=10.2113/gselements.7.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;

In August 2012, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/|accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that PAHs, subjected to [[interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[oxygenate|oxygenation]], and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[organic compound|organics]] — "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gudipati|first1=Murthy S.|last2=Yang|first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24|date=September 1, 2012|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]|volume=756|number=1|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012|bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G|pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/351444/description/Interstellar_chemistry_makes_use_of_quantum_shortcut#comment_351468 Interstellar chemistry makes use of quantum shortcut | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at a significantly higher than expected rate, between cold (around 63 [[kelvin]]s) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which would have to be overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.

A particularly large and rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is [[Sagittarius B2]] (Sgr B2). This giant [[molecular cloud]] lies near the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature.&lt;ref name=ajss60/&gt; A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star [[CW Leonis]] (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.&lt;ref name=kaler2002/&gt;

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of [[life]]&amp;mdash;the [[Carbon-hydrogen bond|carbon-hydrogen molecule]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[methylidyne radical]]), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation) and the carbon ion (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation)&amp;mdash;are the result, in large part, of [[ultraviolet light]] from [[star]]s, rather than in other ways, such as the result of turbulent events related to [[supernovae]] and [[young star]]s, as thought earlier.&lt;ref name="NASA-20161012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=Building Blocks of Life's Building Blocks Come From Starlight |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6645 |date=12 October 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/15|bibcode=2016ApJ...829...15M|title=Herschel/HIFI Spectral Mapping of C+, CH+, and CH in Orion BN/Kl: The Prevailing Role of Ultraviolet Irradiation in CH+ Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=829|pages=15|year=2016|last1=Morris|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Gupta|first2=Harshal|last3=Nagy|first3=Zsofia|last4=Pearson|first4=John C.|last5=Ossenkopf-Okada|first5=Volker|last6=Falgarone|first6=Edith|last7=Lis|first7=Dariusz C.|last8=Gerin|first8=Maryvonne|last9=Melnick|first9=Gary|last10=Neufeld|first10=David A.|last11=Bergin|first11=Edwin A.|arxiv = 1604.05805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical models==
To explain the observed ratios of isomeric compounds, the minimum energy principle has been used. In the majority of cases, it explains that some organic entities have greater abundance than their isomers due to the lower total energies of the first one. However, a few exceptions where the principle fails are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattelais|first1=M.|last2=Pauzat|first2=F.|last3=Ellinger|first3=Y.|last4=Ceccarelli|first4=C.|title=Interstellar Complex Organic Molecules and the Minimum Energy Principle|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2009|volume=696|issue=2|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/L133|bibcode=2009ApJ...696L.133L|pages=L133–L136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach ignores energy and deals only with the molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into the range of the values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabirov|first1=Denis|title=Information entropy of interstellar and circumstellar carbon-containing molecules: Molecular size against structural complexity|journal=Computational and Theoretical Chemistry|date=1 December 2016|volume=1097|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1016/j.comptc.2016.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecules==
The following tables list molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. If there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. For molecules where no designation was given in the scientific literature, that field is left empty. Mass is given in [[atomic mass unit]]s. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is listed in parentheses in each section header.

Most of the molecules detected so far are [[organic molecule|organic]]. Only one inorganic species has been observed in molecules which contain at least five atoms, SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt; Larger molecules have so far all had at least one carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt;

The '''merit order''' is a way of ranking available sources of energy, especially electrical generation, based on ascending order of price (which may reflect the order of their short-run [[marginal cost]]s of production) together with amount of energy that will be generated. In a centralized management, the ranking is so that those with the lowest marginal costs are the first ones to be brought online to meet demand, and the plants with the highest marginal costs are the last to be brought on line. Dispatching generation in this way minimizes the cost of production of electricity.  Sometimes generating units must be started out of merit order, due to transmission congestion, system reliability or other reasons.

[[File:German-electricity-production-mid-dec-2017-bnetza-smard-portal.png | thumb | Plot from the [[Open energy system databases#SMARD|SMARD]] data portal showing electricity generation in Germany in mid-December 2017.  The horizontal ordering is based on merit.]]

== The effect of renewable energy on merit order ==
The high demand for electricity during [[peak demand]] pushes up the bidding price for electricity, and the relatively inexpensive [[baseload power]] supply mix is supplemented by ‘[[peaking power plant]]s,' which charge a premium for their electricity.

Increasing the supply of renewable energy tends to lower the average price per unit of electricity because [[wind energy]] and [[solar energy]] have very low marginal costs: they do not have to pay for fuel, and the sole contributors to their marginal cost is operational and maintenance. With cost often reduced by feed-in-tariff revenue, their electricity is as a result, less costly on the spot market than that from coal or natural gas, and transmission companies buy from them first.&lt;ref name=Blyth,2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate policy uncertainty and investment risk : in support of the G8 plan of action|year=2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|location=Paris|isbn= 9789264030145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0gGyr3h0K8C&amp;pg=PA47|author=William Blyth, Ming Yang, Richard A. Bradley, International Energy Agency|accessdate=24 December 2012|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merit-order effect: A detailed analysis of the price effect of renewable electricity generation on spot market prices in Germany.

Solar and wind electricity therefore substantially reduce the amount of highly priced peak electricity that transmission companies need to buy, reducing the overall cost. A study by the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] found that this "merit order effect" had allowed solar power to reduce the price of electricity on the German energy exchange by 10% on average, and by as much as 40% in the early afternoon, in 2007; as more solar electricity is fed into the grid, peak prices will come down even further.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer" /&gt; By 2006, the "merit order effect" meant that the savings in electricity costs to German consumers more than offset for the support payments paid for renewable electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer" /&gt;

A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation in Germany between the years 2008 and 2012.  For each additional GWh of renewables fed into the grid, the price of electricity in the day-ahead market is reduced by 0.11–0.13{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.  The total merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2012.&lt;ref name="cludius-etal-2013"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zero marginal cost of wind energy does not, however, translate, into zero marginal cost of peak load electricity in a competitive open electricity market system as wind supply cannot be dispatched to meet peak demand. The purpose of the merit order was to enable the lowest net cost electricity to be dispatched first thus minimising overall electricity system costs to consumers. Intermittent wind might be able to supply this economic function provided peak wind supply and peak demand coincide both in time and quantity. On the other hand, solar energy tends to be most abundant during peak energy demand in warm climates, maximizing its ability to displace coal and natural gas power.

A study by the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany found that windpower saves German consumers €5{{nbsp}}billion a year. It is estimated to have lowered prices in European countries with high wind generation by between 3 and 23{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, renewable energy in Germany increased the price for electricity, consumers there now pay 52.8 €/MWh more only for renewable energy (see [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act]]), average price for electricity in Germany now is increased to 26{{nbsp}}¢/kWh. Increasing electrical grid costs for new transmission, market trading and storage associated with wind and solar are not included in the marginal cost of power sources, instead grid costs are combined with source costs at the consumer end.

In [[astronomy]], '''minimum mass''' is the lower-bound calculated [[mass]] of observed objects such as [[planet]]s, [[star]]s and [[binary system]]s, [[nebula]]e, and [[black hole]]s.

Minimum mass is a widely cited statistic for [[extrasolar planet]]s detected by the [[radial velocity method]], and is determined using the [[binary mass function]]. This method reveals planets by measuring changes in the movement of stars in the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], so the real [[orbital inclination]]s and [[true mass]]es of the planets are generally unknown.

If inclination can be determined, the true mass can be obtained from the calculated minimum mass using the following relationship:

: &lt;math&gt;M_\text{true} = \frac{M_\min}{\sin i} \, &lt;/math&gt;

For orbiting bodies in extrasolar [[Star system|stellar]] and [[planetary system]]s, an inclination of 0° or 180° corresponds to a face-on orbit (which cannot be observed by radial velocity), whereas an inclination of 90° corresponds to an edge-on orbit (for which the true mass equals the minimum mass).

In [[physics]], a '''physical body''' or '''physical object''' (or simply a '''body''' or '''object''') is an [[Identity (philosophy)|identifiable]] collection of [[matter]], which may be constrained by an identifiable boundary, and may move as a unit by translation or rotation, in [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional space]].

In common usage, an object is a collection of matter within a defined [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] boundary in [[3-dimensional space]]. The boundary must be defined and identified by the properties of the material.  The boundary may change over time.  The boundary is usually the visible or tangible surface of the object.  The matter in the object is constrained (to a greater or lesser degree) to move as one object.  The boundary may move in space relative to other objects that it is not attached to (through translation and rotation).  An object's boundary may also deform and change over time in other ways.

Also in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of [[matter]].  Atoms or parts of an object may change over time.  An object is defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations.  However the laws of Physics only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.

Each object has a unique identity, independent of any other properties.  Two objects may be identical, in all properties except position, but still remain distinguishable.  In most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time.  The property of identity allows objects to be counted.

Examples of [[scientific model|models]] of physical bodies include, but are not limited to a [[particle]], several [[interaction|interacting]] smaller bodies (particles or other), and [[continuous media]].

The common conception of physical objects includes that they have [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in the [[universe|physical world]], although there do exist [[physical theory|theories]] of [[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]] which may challenge{{how|date=June 2013}} this. In modern physics, "extension" is understood in terms of the [[spacetime]]: roughly speaking, it means that for a given moment of [[time]] the body has some location in the space, although not necessarily a [[point (geometry)|point]]. A physical body as a whole is assumed to have such [[physical quantity|quantitative]] properties as [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[electric charge]], other [[Conservation law (physics)|conserving quantities]], and possibly other quantities.

A body with known composition and described in an adequate physical theory is an example of [[physical system]].

==In common usage==

An object is known by the application of [[sense]]s. The properties of an object are inferred by learning and reasoning based on the information perceived.  Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using [[Occam's razor]].

In common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object, in 3-dimensional space.  The boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside, and what is outside an object.  An object is a single piece of material, whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material.  An imaginary sphere of granite within a larger block of granite would not be considered an identifiable object, in common usage.  A fossilized scull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the scull based on the properties of the material.

For a [[rigid body]], the boundary of an object may change over time by [[Continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]].  For a [[deformable body]] the boundary may also be continuously [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] over time in other ways.

An object has an [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].  In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects).  An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time.  The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[counting|counted]].

The material in an object may change over time.  For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it.  The object will be regarded as the same object after the addition or removal of material, if the system may be more simply described with the continued existence of the object, than in any other way.  The addition or removal of material may discontinuously change the boundary of the object.  The continuation of the objects identity is then based on the description of the system by continued identify being simpler than without continued identity.

For example, a particular car might have all its wheels changed, and still be regarded as the same car.

The identity of an object may not split.  If an object is broken into two pieces at most one of the pieces has the same identity.  An object's identity may also be destroyed if the simplest description of the system at a point in time changes from identifying the object to not identifying it.  Also an object's identity is created at the first point in time that the simplest model of the system consistent with perception identifies it.

An object may be composed of components.  A component is an object completely within the boundary of a containing object.

==Classical mechanics==

In [[classical mechanics]] a physical body is collection of matter having properties including [[mass]], [[velocity]], [[momentum]] and [[energy]].  The matter exists in a volume of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space. This space is its [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]].

Under [[Newtonian gravity]] the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass.

Interactions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape.

In [[continuum mechanics]] an object may be described as a collection of sub objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces which may be described internally by [[pressure]] and [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]].

== Quantum mechanics ==

In [[quantum mechanics]] an object is a particle or collection of particles.  Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a [[Wave function|probability distribution]] of finding the particle at a particular position.  There is a [[Uncertainty principle|limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured]].  A particle or collection of particles is described by a [[quantum state]].

These ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is.

== String theory ==

In [[particle physics]], there is a debate as to whether some [[elementary particle]]s are not bodies, but are [[point (geometry)|points]] without [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in [[physical space]] within [[space-time]], or are always extended in at least one dimension of space as in [[string theory]] or [[M theory]].

==In psychology==
In some branches of [[psychology]], depending on [[school of thought]], a physical body is a [[physical object]] with [[physical properties]], as compared to [[mental objects]].  In ([[reductionistic]]) [[behaviorism]], a physical body and its properties are the (only) [[meaningful]] objects of study.
While in the modern day behavioral psychotherapy it is still only the means for goal oriented behavior modifications, in [[Body Psychotherapy]] it is not a means only anymore, but its felt sense is a goal of its own. In [[cognitive psychology]], physical bodies as they occur in [[biology]] are studied in order to understand the [[mind]], which may not be a physical body, as in [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] schools of thought.

==In philosophy==
{{Further|Ontology|Metaphysics}}

A physical body is an enduring object that exists throughout a particular [[trajectory]] of [[space]] and orientation over a particular duration of [[time]], and which is located in  the [[physical world|world]] of [[physical space]] (i.e., as studied by [[physics]]).  This contrasts with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mathematical object]]s which do not exist at any particular time or place.
Examples are a [[cloud]], a [[human body]], a weight, a billiard ball, a table, or a [[proton]].  This is contrasted with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mental object]]s, which exist in the [[mental world]], and [[mathematical object]]s. Other examples that are '''''not''''' [[physical bodies]] are [[emotions]], the concept of "[[justice]]", a feeling of hatred, or the [[number]] "3".  In some philosophies, like the [[Idealism]] of [[George Berkeley]], a physical body '''''is''''' a [[mental object]], but still has extension in the space of a visual field.

The '''efficiency of a plant''' is the percentage of the total [[energy]] content of a [[power plant]]'s fuel that is converted into [[electricity]]. The remaining energy is usually lost to the environment as [[heat]] unless it is used for [[district heating]].

This is complicated by the fact that there are two different ways to measure the fuel energy input—LCV = Lower Calorific Value, which is the same as NCV = Net Calorific Value, or, HCV = Higher Calorific Value which is the same as GCV, Gross Calorific Value.

Depending on which convention is used, a differences of 10% in the apparent efficiency of a gas fired plant can arise, so it is very important to know which convention, HCV or LCV (NCV or GCV) is being used.
== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ==

Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Advantages of using ETC ===

* Helps developing economies with unreliable or insufficient power infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Gives independent power providers (IPPs), power rental companies and generator OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) a competitive advantage and potential increased market share.
* Improves overall efficiency of the genset, including fuel input costs and helping end-users reduce amount of fuel burned. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Capability to increase power output and capacity, with improved fuel efficiency.
* ETC system integration offers a step change in efficiency without increasing service or maintenance requirements.
* The cost of generating power through waste heat recovery is substantially less than burning more fuel, even with low diesel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Disadvantages of using ETC ===

* Upfront costs incur an additional expense for businesses.
* The need to update existing turbomachinery and recertification of the unit adds additional costs and can be time consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a group of over 70 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the phase out of traditional or unabated coal power.

==History==
The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

{{quotation

"Canada and the UK are right to kick-start the Alliance, as science tells us that OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BREAKING: 25 Jurisdictions Join Canada, UK in Coal Phaseout Alliance |url=https://theenergymix.com/2017/11/16/breaking-25-jurisdictions-join-canada-uk-in-coal-phaseout-alliance/ |accessdate=30 September 2018|date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openeduLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada &amp; UK launch coal phaseout plan |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/environmental-studies/canada-uk-launch-coal-phaseout-plan |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Membership has grown rapidly. By the end of the summit membership was over 20 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="abcnet20"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056 |accessdate=29 September 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month membership had grown to over 50 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance Membership Blows Out Past 50 |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/13/powering-past-coal-alliance-membership-blows-past-50/ |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018 membership stood at 74: 29 countries, 17 regions and 28 organisations.&lt;ref name="nrdc74"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Climate Action Summit: A World Moving Beyond Coal |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/global-climate-action-summit-world-moving-beyond-coal |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the South Korean province of [[South Chungcheong]] became the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korean province joins international coal phase-out club |url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/10/03/south-korean-province-joins-international-coal-phaseout-club/ |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrdsSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=Korean Province to Phase Out Coal: Implications for Asia |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/korean-province-phase-out-coal-implications-asia |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Alliance members agree that:&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50" /&gt;

* Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power.
* Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.
* Businesses/organisations will power operations without coal.
* Members will ensure policies and investments support clean power.
* Members will restrict financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage.

==Members==
Members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance at the start of October 2018 were:&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: Partners |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/powering-past-coal-alliance-declaration/powering-past-coal-alliance-partners |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnet20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">In [[algebraic topology]], the '''pushforward''' of a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; between two [[topological space]]s is a [[homomorphism]]  &lt;math&gt;f_{*}:H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; between the [[homology group]]s for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Homology is a [[functor]] which converts a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a sequence of homology groups &lt;math&gt;H_{n}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;. (Often, the collection of all such groups is referred to using the notation &lt;math&gt;H_{*}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;; this collection has the structure of a [[graded ring]].) In any [[category (mathematics)|category]], a functor must induce a corresponding [[morphism]]. The pushforward is the morphism corresponding to the homology functor.

== Definition for singular and simplicial homology ==

We build the pushforward homomorphism as follows (for singular or simplicial homology):

First we have an induced homomorphism between the singular or simplicial [[chain complex]]   &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined by composing each singular n-[[simplex]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a singular n-simplex of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sigma_X\right) = f\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;. Then we extend &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; linearly via &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sum_tn_t\sigma_t\right) = \sum_tn_tf_{\#}\left(\sigma_t\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)\rightarrow C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is the [[boundary operator]] between chain groups, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''[[chain complex#Chain maps|chain map]]'''.

&lt;!-- We have a diagram
&lt;math&gt;
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(X\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\\
 &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}}\\
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\end{array}\]
&lt;/math&gt; 
such that in each square &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''chain map'''.
--&gt;

We have that &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes cycles to cycles, since &lt;math&gt;\partial \alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}\left( \alpha \right) = f_{\#}\left(\partial \alpha \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Also &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes boundaries to boundaries since &lt;math&gt; f_{\#}\left(\partial \beta \right) = \partial f_{\#}\left(\beta \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; induces a homomorphism between the homology groups &lt;math&gt;f_{*} : H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties and homotopy invariance ==

{{Main|Singular homology#Homotopy invariance}}

Two basic properties of the push-forward are:

# &lt;math&gt;\left( f\circ g\right)_{*} = f_{*}\circ g_{*}&lt;/math&gt; for the composition of maps &lt;math&gt;X\overset{f}{\rightarrow}Y\overset{g}{\rightarrow}Z&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\left( \text{id}_X \right)_{*} = \text{id}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\text{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; refers to identity function of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\text{id}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the identity isomorphism of homology groups.

&lt;br /&gt;
A main result about the push-forward is the '''homotopy invariance''': if two maps &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are homotopic, then they induce the same homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f_{*} = g_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

This immediately implies that the homology groups of homotopy equivalent spaces are isomorphic:

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; induced by a homotopy equivalence &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are isomorphisms for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Renewable Electricity and the Grid: The Challenge of Variability''''' is a 2007 book edited by [[Godfrey Boyle]] which examines the significance of the issue of [[Intermittent power source|variability]] of [[renewable energy]] supplies in the [[electricity grid]].

==Themes==
The energy available from sun, wind, waves, and tides varies in ways which may not match variations in consumer energy demand. Assimilating these fluctuations can affect the operation and economics of electricity networks and markets. There are many myths and misunderstandings surrounding this topic. ''Renewable Electricity and the Grid'' presents technical and operational solutions to the problem of reconciling the differing patterns of power supply and demand.&lt;ref name=boyle&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=1159  Renewable Electricity and the Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==
Chapters of ''Renewable Electricity and the Grid'' are authored by leading experts, who explain and quantify the impacts of  renewable energy variability.  Godfrey Boyle (editor) is Director of the Energy and Environment Research Unit at the UK Open University and has written the textbooks ''Energy Systems and Sustainability'' (2003) and ''Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future'' (2004). He is a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology and a Trustee of the National Energy Foundation.&lt;ref name=boyle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://design.open.ac.uk/boyle/index.htm Godfrey Boyle]&lt;/ref&gt;

RCE is often used to help normalize the size of energy companies. Energy companies serve a number of customers that is typically different from the RCE value consumed by those customers. For example, an [[Local distribution company|LDC]] or [[Deregulated#Energy|ESCO]] may serve 50,000 customers but many of those can be commercial or industrial customers, so that same company can be said to serve 400,000 RCE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">In [[particle physics]], a '''resonance''' is the peak located around a certain energy found in [[differential cross section]]s of [[scattering|scattering experiments]]. These peaks are associated with [[subatomic particle]]s, which include a variety of [[boson]]s, [[quark]]s and [[hadron]]s (such as [[nucleon]]s, [[delta baryon]]s or [[upsilon meson]]s) and their [[excited state|excitations]]. In common usage, "resonance" only describes particles with very short [[mean lifetime|lifetime]]s, mostly high-energy hadrons existing for {{val||e=-23|u=[[second]]s}} or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.duke.edu/~kolena/modern/dudley.html|title=What is a Resonance Particle?|last1=Dudley|first1=Chris|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[resonance width|width of the resonance]] (''&amp;Gamma;'') is related to the [[mean lifetime]] (''&amp;tau;'') of the particle (or its excited state) by the relation

:&lt;Math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{\hbar}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] and &lt;Math&gt;{\hbar}=\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the lifetime of a particle is the direct [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the particle's resonance width. For example, the charged [[pion]] has the second-longest lifetime of any meson, at {{val|2.6033|e=-8|u=[[second|s]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Olive ''et al''. (Particle Data Group) (2016): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/listings/rpp2016-list-pi-plus-minus.pdf Particle listings – {{Subatomic particle|Pion+-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, its resonance width is very small, about {{val|2.528|e=-8|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} or about 6.11 [[megahertz|MHz]]. Pions are generally not considered as "resonances". The charged [[rho meson]] has a very short lifetime, about {{val|4.41|e=-24|u=s}}. Correspondingly, its resonance width is very large, at 149.1 [[megaelectronvolt|MeV]] or about 36 [[zettahertz|ZHz]]. This amounts to nearly one-fifth of the particle's [[rest mass]].&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Olive ''et al''. (Particle Data Group) (2016): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/listings/rpp2016-list-rho-770.pdf Particle listings – {{Subatomic particle|rho}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rolling blackout''', also referred to as '''rotational load shedding''' or '''feeder rotation''', is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an [[electric utility]] company to avoid a total blackout of the power system. They are a type of [[demand response]] for a situation where the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network. Rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network or may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents. Rolling blackouts generally result from two causes: insufficient [[electricity generation|generation]] capacity or inadequate [[electricity transmission|transmission]] infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area where it is needed.

Rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many [[Developing country|developing countries]] where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or [[infrastructure]] is poorly managed.    In well managed under-capacity systems, blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them, but in most cases they happen without warning, typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the 'safe' limit. Rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly such as through an extreme weather event.

Rolling blackouts in [[Developed country|developed countries]] sometimes occur due to economic forces at the expense of system reliability (such as in the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000-2001).

{{For|a list of equations for second moments of area of standard shapes|List of second moments of area}}

The '''2nd moment of area''', also known as '''moment of inertia of plane area''', '''area moment of inertia''', or '''second area moment''', is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for an axis that lies in the plane or with a &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; for an axis perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, it is calculated with a [[multiple integral]] over the object in question. Its dimension is L (length) to the fourth power.   Its [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension when working with the [[International System of Units]] is meters to the fourth power, [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or inches to the fourth power, [[inch|in]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, when working in the [[Imperial units|Imperial System of Units]].

In [[structural engineering]], the second moment of area of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] is an important property used in the calculation of the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the calculation of stress caused by a moment applied to the beam. The '''planar''' second moment of area provides insight into a beam's resistance to bending due to an applied moment, force, or distributed load perpendicular to its neutral axis, as a function of its shape. The '''polar''' second moment of area provides insight into a beam's resistance to torsional deflection, due to an applied moment parallel to its cross-section, as a function of its shape. 

: '''''Note:''' Different disciplines use the term ''moment of inertia'' (''MOI'') to refer to different moments. It may refer to either of the '''planar''' second moments of area (often &lt;math&gt; I_x = \textstyle\iint_{R} x^2\, \mathrm{d}A \text{ or } I_y = \textstyle\iint_{R} y^2&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to some reference plane), or the '''polar''' second moment of area (&lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\iint_{R} r^2\, \mathrm{d}A &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some reference axis).  In each case the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''area'', dA, in some two-dimensional cross-section.  In physics, ''moment of inertia'' is strictly the second moment of '''mass''' with respect to distance from an axis: &lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\int_{Q} r^2 \mathrm{d}m &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some potential rotation axis, and the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''mass'', dm, in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|Q}}.  The MOI, in this sense, is the analog of mass for rotational problems. In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), ''moment of inertia'' commonly refers to the second moment of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=471|quote=The term second moment is more proper than the term moment of inertia, since, logically, the latter should be used only to denote integrals of mass (see Sec. 9.11). In engineering practice, however, moment of inertia is used in connection with areas as well as masses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Definition==
[[File:Moment of area of an arbitrary shape.svg|thumb|175px|An arbitrary shape.  ''ρ'' is the radial distance to the element d''A'', with projections ''x'' and ''y'' on the axes.]]

The second moment of area for an arbitrary shape&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}} with respect to an arbitrary axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;J_{BB'} = \iint\limits_{R} {\rho}^2 \, \mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; is the differential area of the arbitrary shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkey|first1=Walter D.|title=Analysis and Design of Elastic Beams|page=15|date=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=978-0-471-38152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the desired reference axis is the x-axis, the second moment of area &lt;math&gt;I_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; (often denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt;) can be computed in [[Cartesian coordinates]] as

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x} = \iint\limits_{R} y^2\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

The second moment of the area is crucial in [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation|Euler–Bernoulli theory]] of slender beams.

=== Product moment of area ===
More generally, the '''product moment of area''' is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=495|chapter=Chapter 9.8: Product of inertia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{xy} = \iint\limits_{R} yx\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

== Parallel axis theorem ==
[[File:Parallel axis theorem.svg|thumb|175px|A shape with centroidal axis ''x''. The parallel axis theorem can be used to obtain the second moment of area with respect to the ''x''' axis.]]
{{Main article|Parallel axis theorem}}

It is sometimes necessary to calculate the second moment of area of a shape with respect to an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis different to the centroidal axis of the shape. However, it is often easier to derive the second moment of area with respect to its centroidal axis, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and use the parallel axis theorem to derive the second moment of area with respect to the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis. The parallel axis theorem states

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x'} = I_x + A d^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular distance between the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axes.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbeler, R. C. (2004). Statics and Mechanics of Materials (Second ed.). Pearson Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-028127-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=481|chapter=Chapter 9.6: Parallel-axis theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statement can be made about a &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; axis and the parallel centroidal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. Or, in general, any centroidal &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; axis and a parallel &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; axis.

== Perpendicular axis theorem ==
{{Main article|Perpendicular axis theorem}}
For the simplicity of calculation, it is often desired to define the polar moment of area  (with respect to a perpendicular axis) in terms of two area moments of inertia (both with respect to in-plane axes). The simplest case relates &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = \iint\limits_{R} \rho^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} \left(x^2 + y^2\right)\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A + \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = I_x + I_y&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which relates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and on the [[linearity of integration]].

== Composite shapes ==
For more complex areas, it is often easier to divide the area into a series of "simpler" shapes. The second moment of area for the entire shape is the sum of the second moment of areas of all of its parts about a common axis. This can include shapes that are "missing" (i.e. holes, hollow shapes, etc.), in which case the second moment of area of the "missing" areas are subtracted, rather than added. In other words, the second moment of area of "missing" parts are considered negative for the method of composite shapes.

==Examples==
See [[list of second moments of area]] for other shapes.

===Rectangle with centroid at the origin===
[[File:Moment of area of a rectangle through the centroid.svg|thumb|175px|Rectangle with base ''b'' and height ''h'']]
Consider a rectangle with base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; whose [[centroid]] is located at the origin. &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the x-axis; &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the y-axis; &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; represents the polar moment of inertia with respect to the z-axis.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_x &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} y^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \frac{1}{3}\frac{h^3}{4}\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b h^3}{12} \\
  I_y &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} x^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} h x^2\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b^3 h}{12}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[second moment of area#Perpendicular axis theorem|perpendicular axis theorem]] we get the value of &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = I_x + I_y = \frac{b h^3}{12} + \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{b h}{12}\left(b^2 + h^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Annulus centered at origin===
[[File:Moment of area of an annulus.svg|thumb|175px|Annulus with inner radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and outer radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'']]

Consider an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose center is at the origin, outside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;, and inside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the symmetry of the annulus, the centroid also lies at the origin. We can determine the polar moment of inertia, &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;, about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis by the method of composite shapes. This polar moment of inertia is equivalent to the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; minus the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, both centered at the origin.  First, let us derive the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the origin.  In this case, it is easier to directly calculate &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; as we already have &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt;, which has both an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component.  Instead of obtaining the second moment of area from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as done in the previous section, we shall calculate &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; directly using [[polar coordinates]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_{x, circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,dA = \iint\limits_{R} (r\sin{\theta)}^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r (r\sin{\theta})^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) \\
                &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\sin^2{\theta}\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4\sin^2{\theta}}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}r^4 \\
  J_{z,circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
               &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}r^4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the polar moment of inertia about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis for an annulus is simply, as stated above, the difference of the second moments of area of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; and a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;J_z = J_{z, r_2} - J_{z, r_1} = \frac{\pi}{2}r_2^4 - \frac{\pi}{2}r_1^4 = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could change the limits on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}r&lt;/math&gt; integral the first time around to reflect the fact that there is a hole.  This would be done like this.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  J_{z} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
        &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{r_2^4}{4} - \frac{r_1^4}{4}\right]\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Any polygon===

[[File:Moment of area of a polygon.svg|thumb|175px|A simple polygon]]

The second moment of area for any [[simple polygon]] on the XY-plane can be computed in general by summing contributions from each segment of the polygon after essentially chopping the area up into a set of triangles.
A polygon is assumed to have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, numbered in counter-clockwise fashion. If polygon vertices are numbered clockwise, returned values will be negative, but absolute values will be correct.

'''Attention, the following formulae must be trusted'''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     I_x &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i^2 + y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \\
     I_y &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2 \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \\
  I_{xy} &amp;= \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i y_{i+1} + 2 x_i y_i + 2 x_{i+1} y_{i+1} + x_{i+1} y_i \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i \right)

Also, &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be equal to the coordinates of the first vertex, i.e., &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1} = y_1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:S1ABanimated.gif|thumb|An illustration of the selection principle S1(A,B)]]
In mathematics, a '''selection principle''' is a rule asserting
the possibility of obtaining mathematically significant objects by 
selecting elements from given sequences of sets. The theory of '''selection principles'''
studies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties.
Selection principles mainly describe covering properties, 
measure- and category-theoretic properties, and local properties in 
topological spaces, especially function spaces. Often, the 
characterization of a mathematical property using a selection 
principle is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the 
characterized property.

==The main selection principles==
In 1924, [[Karl Menger]]
&lt;ref name="Karl Menger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|
title=Einige Überdeckungssätze der punktmengenlehre|
journal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|
pages=421–444|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-6110-4_14|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: 
Every basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing 
diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, 
[[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurewicz|first1=Witold|
title=Über eine verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|
journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|date=1926|volume=24.1|pages=401–421|
url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01216792|doi=10.1007/bf01216792}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed that Menger's basis property is equivalent to the 
following selective property: for every sequence of open covers of the space, 
one can select finitely many open sets from each cover in the sequence, such that the selected sets cover the space.
Topological spaces having this covering property are called '''Menger spaces'''.

Hurewicz's reformulation of Menger's property was the first important 
topological property described by a selection principle. 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; be classes of mathematical objects.
In 1996, [[Marion Scheepers]]&lt;ref name=coc1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion|
title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|
journal=Topology and its Applications|date=1996|volume=69|pages=31–62|
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following selection hypotheses,
capturing a large number of classic mathematical properties:

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where the classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; consist of covers of some ambient space, Scheepers also introduced the following selection principle.

* &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, none containing a finite subcover, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2,\dotsc\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, [[Boaz Tsaban]] identified the prevalence of the following related principle:
*&lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}}&lt;/math&gt;: Every member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains a member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions thus defined are ''selection principles''. An instantiation of a selection principle, by considering specific classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, gives a ''selection (or: selective) property''. However, these terminologies are used interchangeably in the literature.

===Variations===

For a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the '''star of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the set &lt;math&gt;\text{St}(A,\mathcal{F})=\bigcup\{F\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap F\neq\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1999, [[Ljubisa D.R. Kocinac]] introduced the following ''star selection principles'':&lt;ref name=Kssp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kocinac|first1=Ljubisa D. R.|
title=Star selection principles: a survey|
journal=Khayyam Journal of Mathematics|date=2015|volume=1|pages=82–106|
url=http://emis.de/journals/KJM/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(U_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(\bigcup \mathcal{F}_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Covering properties==

Covering properties form the kernel of the theory of selection principles.  Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}&lt;/math&gt;. (Formally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, but usually the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C&lt;math&gt;''&lt;/math&gt; space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-cover''' if every finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. The class of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[γ-space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega}}{\mathbf{\Gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;), '''star-Rothberger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;).

===The Scheepers Diagram===
There are 36 selection properties of the form &lt;math&gt; \Pi(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\Pi\in\{\text{S}_1, \text{S}_\text{fin},\text{U}_\text{fin}, \bigl(~~\bigr)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\{\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{\Omega}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some of them are trivial (hold for all spaces, or fail for all spaces). Restricting attention to [[Lindelöf space]]s, the diagram below, known as the ''Scheepers Diagram'',&lt;ref name=coc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2|last1=Just|first1=Winfried}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents nontrivial selection properties of the above form, and every nontrivial selection property is equivalent to one in the diagram.  Arrows denote implications.

==Local properties==

Selection principles also capture important non-covering properties.

Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that have the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in their closure is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the ''countable'' elements of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sequences in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that converge to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma_y}&lt;/math&gt;.

* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Gamma_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|strongly Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Gamma_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable strong fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological Games==

There are close connections between selection principles and [[topological game|Topological Games]].

===The Menger game===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Menger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game for two players, Alice and Bob.  It has an inning per each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  At the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; inning, Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,
and Bob chooses a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  
If the family &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A '''strategy''' for a player is a function determining the move of the player, given the earlier moves of both players. A strategy for a player is a '''winning strategy''' if each play where this player sticks to this strategy is won by this player.

* A topological space is &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on this space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc1" /&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15509">The '''Simon-Ehrlich Wager''' describes a 1980 [[scientific wager]] between business professor [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian L. Simon]] and biologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], betting on a mutually agreed-upon measure of [[Natural resource|resource]] [[scarcity]] over the decade leading up to 1990. The widely-followed contest originated in the pages of ''[[Social Science Quarterly]]'', where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that "If I were a gambler, I would take [[even money]] that England will not exist in the year 2000" Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, "to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run."

Simon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990 as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.&lt;ref name=Gorelick&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorelick|first=Steven M.|title=Oil Panic and the Global Crisis: Predictions and Myths|year=2009|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1405195485|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1968, Ehrlich published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select "any date more than a year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.

Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.

Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals had fallen. Chromium, which had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.&lt;ref name=doomslayer&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed Julian Simon a check for $576.07 to settle the wager in Simon's favor.

==Analysis==
Julian Simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in nominal terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation-adjusted terms, with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703014812/http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html |date=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Betrayal of Science and Reason'', Ehrlich wrote that Simon "[asserted] that humanity would never run out of anything". Ehrlich added that he and fellow scientists viewed [[renewable resources]] as more important indicators of the state of planet Earth, but that he decided to go along with the bet anyway.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul | last2=Ehrlich | first2=Anne | authorlink1=Paul Ehrlich | title=Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future | pages=100–104 | year=1998 | isbn=978-1610912501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Simon offered to raise the wager to $20,000 and to use any resources at any time that Ehrlich preferred. Ehrlich countered with a challenge to bet that temperatures would increase in the future.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt; The two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager before Simon died.

Ehrlich could have won if the bet had been for a different ten-year period.&lt;ref name="Betting on the Apocalypse"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sabin|first=Paul|title=Betting on the Apocalypse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/opinion/sunday/betting-on-the-apocalypse.html|accessdate=24 October 2013|date=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=worstall-2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Worstall|first=Tim|title=But Why Did Julian Simon Win The Paul Ehrlich Bet?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/13/but-why-did-julian-simon-win-the-paul-ehrlich-bet/|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grantham&gt;{{citation | last=Grantham | first=Jeremy | title=Resource Limitations 2: Separating the Dangerous from the Merely Serious | periodical=GMO Quarterly Letter | page=12 | date=July 2011 | url=http://davidruyet.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/jgletter_resourcelimitations2_2q11.pdf | publisher=GMO LLC | accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich wrote that the five metals in question had increased in price between the years 1950 to 1975.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt; Asset manager [[Jeremy Grantham]] wrote that if the Simon–Ehrlich wager had been for a longer period (from 1980 to 2011), then Simon would have lost on four of the five metals. He also noted that if the wager had been expanded to "all of the most important commodities," instead of just five metals, over that longer period of 1980 to 2011, then Simon would have lost "by a lot." &lt;ref name=Grantham/&gt; Economist Mark J. Perry noted that for an even longer period of time, from 1934 to 2013, the inflation-adjusted price of the [[Dow Jones]]-AIG Commodity Index showed "an overall significant downward trend" and concluded that Simon was "more right than lucky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/publication/julian-simon-still-more-right-than-lucky-in-2013/ | last=Perry | first=Mark J. | title=Julian Simon: Still more right than lucky in 2013 | publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] | date=January 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Tim Worstall wrote that "The end result of all of this is that yes, it is true that Ehrlich could have, would have, won the bet depending upon the starting date. ... But the long term trend for metals at least is downwards."&lt;ref name=worstall-2013/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The price of raw and other natural commodities such as oil, gold, and uranium have risen substantially in recent years,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} due to increased demand from [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], and other [[newly industrialized country|industrializing countries]]. However, Simon has argued that this price increase is not necessarily contrary to his [[cornucopian]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian|title=The State of Humanity| publisher = Wiley–Blackwell | year = 1996 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-1-55786-585-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich has dismissed the bet as a side issue and stated that the main worry is environmental problems like the [[ozone hole]], [[acid rain]], and [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |author=John Tierney |date=December 2, 1990 |title=Betting on the Planet |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA163CF931A35751C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The proposed second wager==
Understanding that Simon wanted to bet again, Ehrlich and climatologist [[Stephen Schneider]] counter-offered, challenging Simon to bet on 15 current trends, betting $1000 that each will get worse (as in the previous wager) over a ten-year future period.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt;

The trends they bet would continue to worsen were:
* The three years 2002–2004 will on average be warmer than 1992–1994.
* There will be more [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be more [[nitrous oxide]] in the atmosphere in 2004 than 1994.
* The concentration of [[ozone]] in the lower atmosphere (the [[troposphere]]) will be greater than in 1994.
* Emissions of the air pollutant [[sulfur dioxide]] in [[Asia]] will be significantly greater in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less fertile [[cropland]] per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less [[agriculture|agricultural]] soil per person in 2004 than 1994.
* There will be on average less [[rice]] and [[wheat]] grown per person in 2002–2004 than in 1992–1994.
* In [[developing nations]] there will be less [[firewood]] available per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* The remaining area of virgin tropical moist [[forest]]s will be significantly smaller in 2004 than in 1994.
* The [[ocean]]ic [[fishery]] harvest per person will continue its downward trend and thus in 2004 will be smaller than in 1994.
* There will be fewer [[plant]] and [[animal]] [[species]] still extant in 2004 than in 1994.
* More people will die of [[AIDS]] in 2004 than in 1994.
* Between 1994 and 2004, [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] counts of human males will continue to decline and reproductive disorders will continue to increase.
* The [[income inequality|gap in wealth]] between the richest 10% of humanity and the poorest 10% will be greater in 2004 than in 1994.

Simon declined Ehrlich and Schneider's offer to bet, and used the following analogy to explain why he did so:&lt;ref&gt;http://jasoncollins.org/2011/05/20/the-simon-ehrlich-bet/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Let me characterize their offer as follows. I predict, and this is for real, that the average performances in the next [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] will be better than those in the last Olympics. On average, the performances have gotten better, Olympics to Olympics, for a variety of reasons. What Ehrlich and others says is that they don't want to bet on athletic performances, they want to bet on the conditions of the track, or the weather, or the officials, or any other such indirect measure.}}

In his 1981 book ''[[The Ultimate Resource]]'', Simon noted that not all decreases in resources or increases in unwanted effects correspond to overall decreases in human wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Simon-1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian|title=The Ultimate Resource|date=August 1981|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=069109389X|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Resource-Julian-Lincoln-Simon/dp/069109389X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence there can be an "optimal level of pollution" which accepts some increases in certain kinds of pollution in a way that increases overall wellbeing, while acknowledging that any increase in pollution is nevertheless a cost which must be considered in any such calculation (p.143). Some of the trends listed above are actually predicted by Simon's theory of resource development, and do not in themselves even count as costs (as pollution does). E.g., he pointed out that due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so (p.5). The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries, and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish, if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/ozone-trends&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other wagers==
In 1996, Simon bet $1000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |title=The Simon South Bet On Pine Sawtimber |publisher=Forestry.auburn.edu |date=1998-02-08 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Xuoqlqvo?url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, when ''[[The Economist]]'' headlined an article entitled, "$5 a barrel oil soon?" and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010.  No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel). Madjd-Sadjadi paid South an inflation-adjusted $1,242 in January 2010. The price of oil at the time was $81/barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/sfnmc/web/oilbet.html |title=The Madjd-Sadjadi South Bet On Oil |publisher=Forestry.auburn.edu |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608030701/https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/sfnmc/web/oilbet.html |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil''' is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support [[life]]. [[Earth]]'s body of soil is the [[pedosphere]], which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of [[water storage]], supply and purification; it is a modifier of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil.

The pedosphere interfaces with the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesworth |first=Ward |date=2008 |title=Encyclopedia of soil science |isbn=978-1402039942 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |nopp=true |url=http://data.lib.hutech.edu.vn/mucluc/f2e0a00788a82be82718e64d734d1a50.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pedolith'', used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ''ground stone''. Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a [[Porosity|porous]] phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voroney |first1=R.

Soil is a major component of the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, from [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] to [[rainforest destruction]] and [[water pollution]].

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] which consists of two or more layers, referred to as [[soil horizon]]s, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.&lt;ref name="Buol"/&gt; The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[Soil#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}}

The [[soil texture]] is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] processes causes those particles to [[flocculate]] (stick together) to form [[soil structure|aggregates]] or [[ped]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronick |first1=Carol J. |last2=Lal |first2=Ratan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil structure and management: a review |journal=Geoderma |date=January 2005 |volume=124 |issue=1/2 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.005 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/soil_structure.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Geode.124....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, [[porosity]], [[consistency]], reaction ([[acidity]]), etc.

Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |website=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil [[pore space]] is called the soil solution. Since [[soil water]] is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of minerals from the [[soil profile]]. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Christian |last2=d'Herbès |first2=Jean-Marc |last3=Poesen |first3=Jean |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=37 |issue=1 |title=Soil and water components of banded vegetation patterns |year=1999 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248379223 |pages=1‒24 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00053-3 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrient availability is affected by [[soil pH]], which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18519/FS-1054%20Soil%20pH%20and%20Nutrient%20Availbility.pdf |last=Miller |first=Jarrod O. |title=Soil pH affects nutrient availability |website=[[University of Maryland]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the [[mineral]]s that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulding |first1=Keith W.T. |last2=Bailey |first2=Neal J. |last3=Bradbury |first3=Nicola J. |last4=Hargreaves |first4=Patrick |last5=Howe |first5=MT |last6=Murphy |first6=Daniel V. |last7=Poulton |first7=Paul R. |last8=Willison |first8=Toby W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=139 |issue=1 |title=Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes |year=1998 |pages=49‒58 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues ([[soil organic matter]]), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living [[Soil microbe|microorganisms]] and [[soil organic matter]] are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kononova |first=M.

==History of studies==

===Fertility===
The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for our animals. Throughout history, civilizations have prospered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of their soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillel |first=Daniel |date=1993 |title=Out of the Earth: civilization and the life of the soil |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520080805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: "But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung."{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}

[[Columella]]'s "Husbandry," circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]] ([[green manure]]) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the [[Roman Empire]] until its collapse.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=1}} From the [[fall of Rome]] to the [[French Revolution]], knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low. During the European [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], [[Ibn al-'Awwam|Yahya Ibn al-'Awwam]]'s handbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=[[Ibn al-'Awwam]] |date=1864 |title=Le livre de l'agriculture, traduit de l'arabe par Jean Jacques Clément-Mullet |publisher=Librairie A.

Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Ploeg |first1=Rienk R. |last2=Schweigert |first2=Peter |last3=Bachmann |first3=Joerg |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Scientific World Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=S2 |title=Use and misuse of nitrogen in agriculture: the German story |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/683180/abs/ |year=2001 |pages=737–44 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.263 |pmid=12805882 |pmc=6084271 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1635, the Flemish chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=3}} [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0023133404}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of [[soil fertility]]. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]]'s willow tree derived from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1-5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the "[[superphosphate]]", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.

In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J.

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

[[Crop rotation]], mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Formation===
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of [[Life|biotic]] and abiotic (not associated with life) processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, others began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] studied the relationship among rock material, climate, and vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered soil types classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1921 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/65783 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka|Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ge |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis F. Marbut]] was influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as he was placed in charge of the U. S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;

==Formation==
Soil formation, or [[pedogenesis]], is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and [[colloid]]s are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive [[soil horizons]]. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those [[regolith]]s that formed on Mars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Janice L. |last2=Murchie |first2=Scott L. |last3=Pieters |first3=Carlé L. |last4=Zent |first4=Aaron P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002 |title=A model for formation of dust, soil, and rock coatings on Mars: physical and chemical processes on the Martian surface |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=E11 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1029/2001JE001581 |bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5097B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro-González |first1=Rafael |last2=Rainey |first2=Fred A. |last3=Molina |first3=Paola |last4=Bagaley |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Hollen |first5=Becky J. |last6=de la Rosa |first6=José |last7=Small |first7=Alanna M. |last8=Quinn |first8=Richard C. |last9=Grunthaner |first9=Frank J. |last10=Cáceres |first10=Luis |last11=Gomez-Silva |first11=Benito |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2003 |title=Mars-like soils in the Atacama desert, Chile, and the dry limit of microbial life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–21 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |pmid=14605363 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9020258 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[lichens]] and [[cyanobacteria]] then [[epilithic]] [[higher plants]]) become established very quickly on [[basalt]]ic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with [[nutrient]]-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks.

===Factors===

How soil formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time.&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenny |first=Hans |title=Factors of soil formation: a system of qunatitative pedology |year=1941 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |url=http://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/sykc/hjx/content/ckzl/6/2.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reordered to climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CROPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html |title=The physical environment: an introduction to physical geography |first=Michael E. |last=Ritter |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parent material====
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called [[parent material]]. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20–21}}
* [[Quartz]]: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Calcite]]: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Lössacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.
* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60–90 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

=====Weathering=====
The [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable. Chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility, the rate of which doubles with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature, but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes. Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts.&lt;ref name="Gilluly1975"/&gt; Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction. Chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of [[organic acids]] and [[chelating]] compounds by bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uroz |first1=Stéphane |last2=Calvaruso |first2=Christophe |last3=Turpault |first3=Marie-Pierre |last4=Frey-Klett |first4=Pascale |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |title=Mineral weathering by bacteria: ecology, actors and mechanisms |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=378–87 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001279 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2009.05.004 |pmid=19660952 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungi,&lt;ref name="Landeweert2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landeweert |first1=Renske |last2=Hoffland |first2=Ellis |last3=Finlay |first3=Roger D. |last4=Kuyper |first4=Thom W. |last5=Van Breemen |first5=Nico |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Linking plants to rocks: ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize nutrients from minerals |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=248–54 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470102122X |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02122-X |pmid=11301154 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to increase under present-day [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Schlesinger |first2=William H. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Soil CO2 dynamics, acidification, and chemical weathering in a temperate forest with experimental CO2 enrichment |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |doi=10.1029/2000GB001278 |bibcode=2001GBioC..15..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Physical disintegration''' is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28–31}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839–41 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chemical decomposition''' and '''structural changes''' result when minerals are made soluble by water or are changed in structure. The first three of the following list are solubility changes and the last three are structural changes.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=31–33}}

# '''[[Hydrolysis]]''' is the transformation of minerals into [[Chemical polarity|polar]] molecules by the splitting of intervening water. This results in soluble [[acid-base]] pairs.

# '''[[redox|Reduction]]''', the opposite of oxidation, means the removal of oxygen, hence the oxidation number of some part of the mineral is reduced, which occurs when oxygen is scarce.

[[Saprolite]] is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called [weathered granite], saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: [[hydrolysis]], [[chelation]] from organic compounds, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include [[freezing]] and [[thawing]]. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary [[bedrock]] material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called ''arenization'', resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ([[micas]],  [[amphiboles]], [[feldspars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sequeira Braga |first1=Maria Amália |last2=Paquet |first2=Hélène |last3=Begonha |first3=Arlindo |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Weathering of granites in a temperate climate (NW Portugal): granitic saprolites and arenization |journal=Catena |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://home.uevora.pt/~lopes/Artigos/23.PDF |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00017-6 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective [[precipitation]] (i.e., precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]]) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]]: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Howard E. |last2=Burke |first2=Ingrid C. |last3=Lauenroth |first3=William K. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regional patterns of decomposition and primary production rates in the U.S. Great Plains |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=320–27 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233379719 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0320:RPODAP]2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is the dominant factor in [[soil formation]], and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the [[climate zone]]s in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of [[weathering]], [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and plant growth will be maximized. According to the climatic determination of [[biomes]], humid climates favor the growth of trees. In contrast, grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and [[semiarid]] regions, while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodward |first1=F.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the [[regolith]]. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site [[topography]], and [[soil permeability]] interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers ([[eluviation]]) to the lower layers ([[illuviation]]), including clay particles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedoroff |first=Nicolas |year=1997 |title=Clay illuviation in Red Mediterranean soils |journal=Catena |volume=28 |issue=3/4 |pages=171–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816296000367 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00036-7 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dissolved organic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michalzik |first1=Beate |last2=Kalbitz |first2=Karsten |last3=Park |first3=Ji-Hyung |last4=Solinger |first4=Stephan |last5=Matzner |first5=Egbert |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen: a synthesis for temperate forests |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=173–205 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226356840 |doi=10.1023/A:1006441620810 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters.

Climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity, which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=Yves |year=2001 |title=The role of plants in controlling rates and products of weathering: importance of biological pumping |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |volume=29 |pages=135–63 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228608786 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.135 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2001AREPS..29..135L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topography====
The [[topography]], or [[relief]], is characterized by the inclination ([[slope]]), [[elevation]], and orientation of the terrain. Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L. Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |title=Slope gradient effects on soil loss for steep slopes |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1835–40 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270613706 |doi=10.13031/2013.28273 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[swales]] and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s. Intermediate topography affords the best conditions for the formation of an agriculturally productive soil.

Soil is the most abundant [[ecosystem]] on Earth, but the vast majority of organisms in soil are [[microbes]], a great many of which have not been described.&lt;ref name="Gans2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gans |first1=Jason |last2=Wolinsky |first2=Murray |last3=Dunbar |first3=John |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Computational improvements reveal great bacterial diversity and high metal toxicity in soil |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=309 |issue=5739 |pages=1387–90 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7637990 |doi=10.1126/science.1112665 |pmid=16123304 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Sci...309.1387G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dance |first=Amber |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |title=What lies beneath |year=2008 |volume=455 |issue=7214 |pages=724–25 |pmid=18843336 |doi=10.1038/455724a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081008/pdf/455724a.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a population limit of around one billion cells per gram of soil, but estimates of the number of species vary widely from 50,000 per gram to over a million per gram of soil.&lt;ref name="Gans2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roesch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roesch |first1=Luiz F.W. |last2=Fulthorpe |first2=Roberta R. |last3=Riva |first3=Alberto |last4=Casella |first4=George |last5=Hadwin |first5=Alison K.M. |last6=Kent |first6=Angela D. |last7=Daroub |first7=Samira H. |last8=Camargo |first8=Flavio A.O. |last9=Farmerie |first9=William G. |last10=Triplett |first10=Eric W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[The ISME Journal]] |title=Pyrosequencing enumerates and contrasts soil microbial diversity |year=2007 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=283–90 |pmc=2970868 |pmid=18043639 |doi=10.1038/ismej.2007.53|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5803531 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of organisms and species can vary widely according to soil type, location, and depth.&lt;ref name="nature2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roesch"/&gt;

The physical properties of soils, in order of decreasing importance for [[ecosystem services]] such as [[crop production]], are [[Soil texture|texture]], [[Soil structure|structure]], [[bulk density]], [[Pore space in soil|porosity]], consistency, temperature, colour and [[Soil resistivity|resistivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=Catriona M.K. |last2=Laryea |first2=Kofi Buna |last3=Unger |first3=Paul W. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1999 |title=Soil physical constraints to plant growth and crop production |edition=1st |location=Rome, Italy |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |url=http://plantstress.com/Files/Soil_Physical_Constraints.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil texture is determined by the relative proportion of the three kinds of soil mineral particles, called soil separates: [[sand]], [[silt]], and [[clay]].

The mineral components of soil are [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]], and their relative proportions determine a soil's texture. Properties that are influenced by soil texture include [[Pore space in soil|porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[Shrink–swell capacity|shrink-swell rate]], [[Field capacity|water-holding capacity]], and susceptibility to [[erosion]]. In the illustrated USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil in which neither sand, silt nor clay predominates is called [[loam]]. While even pure sand, silt or clay may be considered a soil, from the perspective of conventional [[agriculture]] a loam soil with a small amount of organic material is considered "ideal", inasmuch as [[fertilizers]] or [[manure]] are currently used to mitigate nutrient losses due to [[crop yields]] in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haynes |first1=Richard J. |last2=Naidu |first2=Ravi |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems |volume=51 |issue=2 |title=Influence of lime, fertilizer and manure applications on soil organic matter content and soil physical conditions: a review |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225252692 |year=1998 |pages=123–37 |doi=10.1023/A:1009738307837 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral constituents of a loam soil might be 40% sand, 40% silt and the balance 20% clay by weight.

Sand and silt are the products of physical and chemical [[weathering]] of the [[parent rock]];&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"/&gt; clay, on the other hand, is most often the product of the precipitation of the dissolved parent rock as a secondary mineral, except when derived from the weathering of [[mica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Marion L. |journal=Clays and Clay Minerals |volume=6 |issue=1 |title=Frequency distribution of clay minerals in major great soil groups as related to the factors of soil formation |url=http://www.clays.org/journal/archive/volume%206/6-1-133.pdf |year=1957 |pages=133–43 |doi=10.1346/CCMN.1957.0060111 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1957CCM.....6..133J }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the surface area to volume ratio ([[specific surface area]]) of soil particles and the unbalanced ionic [[electric charges]] within those that determine their role in the [[fertility]] of soil, as measured by its [[cation exchange capacity]].&lt;ref name="Petersen 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Moldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole Hørbye |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=D.

But it is the clay content of soil, with its very high specific surface area and generally large number of negative charges, that gives a soil its high retention capacity for water and nutrients.&lt;ref name="Petersen 1996"/&gt; Clay soils also resist wind and water erosion better than silty and sandy soils, as the particles bond tightly to each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouyoucos |first=George J. |journal=Journal of the American Society of Agronomy |volume=27 |issue=9 |title=The clay ratio as a criterion of susceptibility of soils to erosion |url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/abstracts/27/9/AJ0270090738?access=0&amp;view=pdf |year=1935 |pages=738–41 |subscription=yes |accessdate=25 December 2017 |doi=10.2134/agronj1935.00021962002700090007x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily [[quartz]] particles, ranging in size from {{convert|2.0|to|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Silt ranges in size from {{convert|0.05|to|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are {{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}} or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 [[angstroms]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m).{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Flemming|1957|p=331}} In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called [[eluviation]]) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called [[illuviation]]). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be [[calcareous]] as well as [[siliceous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/calcsand.html |title=Calcareous Sand |website=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while textural clay ({{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grim |first=Ralph E. |date=1953 |title=Clay mineralogy |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, NY |url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2037422/1/1334.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their [[specific surface area]] (e.g. [[moisture retention]]) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. [[cation exchange capacity]]).

Soil components larger than {{convert|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} are classed as rock and gravel and are removed before determining the percentages of the remaining components and the textural class of the soil, but are included in the name. For example, a sandy [[loam]] soil with 20% gravel would be called gravelly sandy loam.

When the organic component of a soil is substantial, the soil is called organic soil rather than mineral soil. A soil is called organic if:

# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
# Mineral fraction is 0% to 50% clay and organic matter is between 20% and 30%
# Mineral fraction is 50% or more clay and organic matter 30% or more.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=53}}

===Structure===
{{Main|Ped|Soil structure|Structural Soil}}
The clumping of the soil textural components of sand, silt and clay causes [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] to form and the further association of those aggregates into larger units creates [[soil structure]]s called peds (a contraction of the word [[pedolith]]).

Soil structure often gives clues to its texture, organic matter content, biological activity, past soil evolution, human use, and the chemical and mineralogical conditions under which the soil formed. While texture is defined by the mineral component of a soil and is an innate property of the soil that does not change with agricultural activities, soil structure can be improved or destroyed by the choice and timing of farming practices.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"/&gt;

Soil structural classes:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=55–56}}

# Types: '''Shape''' and arrangement of peds
## Platy: Peds are flattened one atop the other 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Found in the A-horizon of forest soils and lake sedimentation.
## Prismatic and Columnar: Prismlike peds are long in the vertical dimension, 10–100&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5–50&amp;nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.
# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type
## Very fine or very thin: &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm platy and spherical; &lt;5&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Fine or thin: 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Medium: 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 20–50 prismlike.
## Coarse or thick: 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 50–100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Very coarse or very thick: &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; &gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.
## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.
## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.

At the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink–swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishné |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

===Porosity===
{{main|Pore space in soil}}
[[Pore space]] is that part of the bulk volume of soil that is not occupied by either mineral or organic matter but is open space occupied by either gases or water. In a productive, medium-textured soil the total pore space is typically about 50% of the soil volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical aspects of crop productivity |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9926e/v9926e04.htm |website=www.fao.org |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pore space in soil#Pore types|Pore size]] varies considerably; the smallest pores ([[Pore space in soil#cryptopores|cryptopores]]; &lt;0.1 [[micrometre|µm]]) hold water too tightly for use by plant roots; [[Available water capacity|plant-available water]] is held in [[Pore space in soil#ultramicropores|ultramicropores]], [[Pore space in soil#micropores|micropores]] and [[Pore space in soil#mesopores|mesopores]] (0.1–75 [[µm]]); and [[Pore space in soil#macropores|macropores]] (&gt;75 [[µm]]) are generally air-filled when the soil is at [[field capacity]].

The pore size distribution affects the ability of plants and other organisms to access water and oxygen; large, continuous pores allow rapid transmission of air, water and dissolved nutrients through soil, and small pores store water between rainfall or irrigation events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nimmo |first=John R. |date=2004 |chapter=Porosity and pore size distribution |title=Encyclopedia of soils in the environment, volume 3 |edition=1st |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Hillel |editor2-first=Cynthia |editor2-last=Rosenzweig |editor3-first=David |editor3-last=Powlson |editor4-first=Kate |editor4-last=Scow |editor5-first=Michail |editor5-last=Singer |editor6-first=Donald |editor6-last=Sparks |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=London, United Kingdom |pages=295–303 |isbn=978-0123485304 |url=https://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/uzf/abs_pubs/papers/nimmo.04.encyc.por.ese.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pore size variation also compartmentalizes the soil pore space such that many microbial and faunal organisms are not in direct competition with one another, which may explain not only the large number of species present, but the fact that functionally redundant organisms (organisms with the same ecological niche) can co-exist within the same soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giller |first=Paul S. |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=5 |issue=2 |title=The diversity of soil communities, the 'poor man's tropical rainforest' |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226978038 |year=1996 |pages=135–68 |doi=10.1007/BF00055827 |accessdate=1 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consistency===
Consistency is the ability of soil to stick to itself or to other objects ([[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and [[adhesion]], respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boekel |first1=P. |last2=Peerlkamp |first2=Petrus K. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |title=Soil consistency as a factor determining the soil structure of clay soils |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/211680 |year=1956 |pages=122–25 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the engineering of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Robert W. |date=2000 |chapter=Soil mechanics and foundations |title=Building design and construction handbook |edition=6th |editor1-first=Frederick S. |editor1-last=Merritt |editor2-first=Jonathan T. |editor2-last=Rickett |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0070419995 |url=http://my.fit.edu/~locurcio/14-Civil%20&amp;%20Const%20handbooks/McGraw%20Hill%20-%20Design%20&amp;%20Const%20Handbook/06-Soils%20&amp;%20Foundations.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6706e/x6706e08.htm |title=Soil consistency |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.

The terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:

# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm
# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic
# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62–63, 565–67}}

Soil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.

Soil [[heat flux]] refers to the rate at which [[heat energy]] moves through the soil in response to a temperature difference between two points in the soil. The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:

: &lt;math&gt;q_x  = - k \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units
: &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
: &lt;math&gt;\delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.

Heat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.

===Color===
{{Main|Soil color}}
Soil colour is often the first impression one has when viewing soil. Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma. The [[Yellow River]] in China carries yellow sediment from eroding loess soils. [[Mollisols]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America are darkened and enriched by organic matter. [[Podsol]]s in [[Taiga|boreal forests]] have highly contrasting layers due to acidity and leaching.

In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation. Soil color, while easily discerned, has little use in predicting soil characteristics.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=71}} It is of use in distinguishing boundaries of [[Soil horizon|horizons]] within a soil profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sss/2014/03/30/soil-color-never-lies/ |publisher=[[European Geosciences Union]] |title=Soil color never lies |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining the origin of a soil's [[parent material]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viscarra Rossel |first1=Raphael A. |last2=Cattle |first2=Stephen R. |last3=Ortega |first3=A. |last4=Fouad |first4=Youssef |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geoderma |volume=150 |title=In situ measurements of soil colour, mineral composition and clay content by vis–NIR spectroscopy |year=2009 |pages=253–66 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of wetness and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] conditions,&lt;ref name="Blavet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blavet |first1=Didier |last2=Mathe |first2=E. |last3=Leprun |first3=Jean-Claude |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=39 |issue=3 |title=Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_55-56/010021572.pdf |year=2000 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a qualitative means of measuring organic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=J.

===Resistivity===
{{main|Soil resistivity}}
Soil resistivity is a measure of a soil's ability to retard the [[electrical conduction|conduction]] of an [[electric current]].

==Water==
{{Further|Water content|Water potential}}

Water that enters a field is removed from a field by [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[drainage]], [[evaporation]] or [[transpiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=James S. |last2=Batchelor |first2=Charles H. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=352 |issue=1356 |title=Managing water resources for crop production |year=1997 |pages=937–47 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1997.0073 |pmc=1691982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff is the water that flows on the surface to the edge of the field; drainage is the water that flows through the soil downward or toward the edge of the field underground; evaporative water loss from a field is that part of the water that evaporates into the atmosphere directly from the field's surface; transpiration is the loss of water from the field by its evaporation from the plant itself.

Water affects [[soil formation]], [[soil structure|structure]], stability and [[erosion]] but is of primary concern with respect to plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Veihmeyer |first1=Frank J. |last2=Hendrickson |first2=Arthur H. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |title=Soil-moisture conditions in relation to plant growth |year=1927 |pages=71–82 |doi=10.1104/pp.2.1.71 |pmid=16652508 |pmc=439946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is essential to plants for four reasons:

A flooded field will drain the gravitational water under the influence of [[gravity]] until water's adhesive and cohesive forces resist further drainage at which point it is said to have reached [[field capacity]].{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=48}} At that point, plants must apply [[suction]]{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=48}}{{sfn|Richards|Richards|1957|p=50}} to draw water from a soil.

A plant must produce suction that increases from zero for a flooded field to 1/3&amp;nbsp;bar at field dry condition (one bar is a little less than one atmosphere pressure). At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, [[wilting point]], seeds will not germinate,{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=39}}{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=48}}{{sfn|Richards|Richards|1957|p=52}} plants begin to wilt and then die.

The rate at which a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores ([[macropores]]) first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the remaining water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores ([[micropores]]). The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away.

===Water retention forces===
{{Further|Soil water (retention)|Water retention curve}}
Water is retained in a soil when the [[adhesive force]] of attraction that water's [[hydrogen]] atoms have for the [[oxygen]] of soil particles is stronger than the cohesive forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–74}} When a field is flooded, the soil [[pore space]] is completely filled by water. The field will drain under the force of gravity until it reaches what is called [[field capacity]], at which point the smallest pores are filled with water and the largest with water and gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of water held when field capacity is reached is a function of the [[specific surface area]] of the soil particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Møldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole H. |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, high clay and high organic soils have higher field capacities.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Satish C. |last2=Larson |first2=William E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Water Resources Research]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |title=Estimating soil water retention characteristics from particle size distribution, organic matter percent, and bulk density |year=1979 |pages=1633–5 |doi=10.1029/WR015i006p01633 |bibcode=1979WRR....15.1633G |citeseerx=10.1.1.475.497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed [[suction]] and usually expressed in units of bars (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure. Alternatively, the terms "soil moisture tension" or [[water potential]] may be used.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–75}}

===Moisture classification===
The forces with which water is held in soils determine its availability to plants. Forces of [[adhesion]] hold water strongly to mineral and humus surfaces and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles produce increasingly higher [[suction]], finally up to 15&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=Michael J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Joe T. |last3=Bland |first3=William L. |last4=Dugas |first4=William A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agronomy Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |title=Lower limit of soil water availability |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309079210 |year=1996 |pages=644–51 |doi=10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800040024x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called [[wilting point]]. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration, the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts, although [[stoma]]tal closure may decrease transpiration and thus may retard wilting below the [[wilting point]], in particular under [[adaptation]] or [[acclimatization]] to drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Ani |first1=Tariq |last2=Bierhuizen |first2=Johan Frederik |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica |volume=20 |issue=3 |title=Stomatal resistance, transpiration, and relative water content as influenced by soil moisture stress |url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&amp;docid=539770 |year=1971 |pages=318–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1971.tb00715.x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=75–76}}

===Soil moisture content===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensor|Moisture content}}
When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth, the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type. Sandy soil will retain very little water, while clay will hold the maximum amount.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"/&gt; The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay [[loam]] that begins at 43% water by weight to a field capacity of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11% water. The available water for the clay loam might be 11% whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8% by weight.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=76–77}}

The above are average values for the soil textures as the percentages of sand, silt and clay vary.

===Water flow===
Water moves through soil due to the force of [[gravity]], [[osmosis]] and [[capillarity]]. At zero to one-third bar [[suction]], water is pushed through soil from the point of its application under the force of gravity and the pressure gradient created by the pressure of the water; this is called saturated flow. At higher suction, water movement is pulled by capillarity from wetter toward drier soil. This is caused by water's [[adhesion]] to soil solids, and is called unsaturated flow.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/AGRO103/lec03.pdf |title=Soil water movement: saturated and unsaturated flow and vapour movement, soil moisture constants and their importance in irrigation |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water infiltration and movement in soil is controlled by six factors:

# Soil texture
# Soil structure. Fine-textured soils with granular structure are most favourable to infiltration of water.
# The amount of organic matter. Coarse matter is best and if on the surface helps prevent the destruction of soil structure and the creation of crusts.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
# The amount of water already in the soil
# Soil temperature. Warm soils take in water faster while frozen soils may not be able to absorb depending on the type of freezing.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=86}}

Water infiltration rates range from {{convert|0.25|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for high clay soils to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for sand and well stabilised and aggregated soil structures.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=88}} Water flows through the ground unevenly, in the form of so-called "gravity fingers", because of the [[surface tension]] between water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueto-Felgueroso |first1=Luis |last2=Juanes |first2=Ruben |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=24 |title=Nonlocal interface dynamics and pattern formation in gravity-driven unsaturated flow through porous media |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bcee/6f04cc7a8bc8df98d0cb48410ccb1efb6a33.pdf |year=2008 |pages=244504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.244504 |pmid=19113626 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101x4504C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/research/pfweb/educators/intro/fingerflow.htm |title=Finger flow in coarse soils |website=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water uptake by plants===
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients. Most soil water is taken up by plants as passive [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] caused by the pulling force of water evaporating ([[transpiration|transpiring]]) from the long column of water ([[xylem sap]] flow) that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves, according to the [[cohesion-tension theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aston |first1=M.

Root extension is vital for plant survival. A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&amp;nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&amp;nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&amp;nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&amp;nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&amp;nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&amp;nbsp;square feet (83&amp;nbsp;ft squared). The total surface area of the loam soil was estimated to be 560,000&amp;nbsp;square feet.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=46}} In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil. However, root extension should be viewed as a dynamic process, allowing new roots to explore a new volume of soil each day, increasing dramatically the total volume of soil explored over a given growth period, and thus the volume of water taken up by the root system over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Paul J. |last2=Coile |first2=Theodore S. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |title=An estimation of the volume of water made available by root extension |year=1940 |pages=743–7 |doi=10.1104/pp.15.4.743 |pmid=16653671 |pmc=437871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root architecture, i.e. the spatial configuration of the root system, plays a prominent role in the adaptation of plants to soil water and nutrient availabiity, and thus in plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |title=Root architecture and plant productivity |year=1995 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.1.7 |pmid=12228579 |pmc=157559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots must seek out water as the unsaturated flow of water in soil can move only at a rate of up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch) per day; as a result they are constantly dying and growing as they seek out high concentrations of soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comas |first1=Louise H. |last2=Eissenstat |first2=David M. |last3=Lakso |first3=Alan N. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |title=Assessing root death and root system dynamics in a study of grape canopy pruning |year=2000 |pages=171–8 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00679.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient soil moisture, to the point of causing [[wilting]], will cause permanent damage and [[crop yield]]s will suffer.

===Consumptive use and water use efficiency===
Only a small fraction (0.1% to 1%) of the water used by a plant is held within the plant. The majority is ultimately lost via [[transpiration]], while [[evaporation]] from the soil surface is also substantial, the transpiration:evaporation ratio varying according to vegetation type and climate, peaking in [[tropical rainforests]] and dipping in [[steppes]] and [[deserts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=William H. |last2=Jasechko |first2=Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agricultural and Forest Meteorology]] |volume=189/190 |title=Transpiration in the global water cycle |url=http://www.isohydro.ca/uploads/1/4/1/9/14194300/2014-schlesinger-jasechko-agformet.pdf |year=2014 |pages=115–7 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.01.011 |accessdate=22 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2014AgFM..189..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration plus evaporative soil moisture loss is called [[evapotranspiration]].

The total water used in an agricultural field includes [[surface runoff]], [[drainage]] and consumptive use. The use of loose [[mulch]]es will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, but in the end the total evaporative loss (plant plus soil) will approach that of an uncovered soil, while more water is immediately available for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolk |first1=Judy A. |last2=Howell |first2=Terry A. |last3=Evett |first3=Steve R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=50 |issue=2 |title=Effect of mulch, irrigation, and soil type on water use and yield of maize |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=1896&amp;content=PDF |year=1999 |pages=137–47 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(99)00011-2 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water use efficiency]] is measured by the [[transpiration ratio]], which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700. For example, alfalfa may have a transpiration ratio of 500 and as a result 500&amp;nbsp;kilograms of water will produce one&amp;nbsp;kilogram of dry alfalfa.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=97–99}}

==Atmosphere==
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is radically different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of [[oxygen]] by microbes and plant roots, and their release of [[carbon dioxide]], decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil [[pore space]] it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous soils regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration thanks to [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respired accumulates in the soil pore system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_Karberg_001.pdf |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme levels CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.

# Layer Crystalline '''alumino-silica clays''': [[montmorillonite]], [[illite]], [[vermiculite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[kaolinite]].
# Crystalline Chain '''carbonate and sulfate minerals''': [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[dolomite]] (CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H2O).

# '''Sesquioxide clays''': old, highly leached clays which result in oxides of [[iron]], [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]].{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=101–07}}

====Alumino-silica clays====
'''Alumino-silica clays''' or [[aluminosilicate]] clays are characterised by their regular [[crystalline]] or quasi-crystalline structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aylmore |first1=L. A.

* '''Montmorillonite''' clay is made of four planes of oxygen with two silicon and one central aluminium plane intervening.

As the crystals are not bonded face to face, the entire surface is exposed and available for surface reactions, hence it has a high cation exchange capacity (CEC).{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=108}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}
* '''Illite''' is a 2:1 clay similar in structure to montmorillonite but has potassium bridges between the faces of the clay crystals and the degree of swelling depends on the degree of weathering of the potassium. The active surface area is reduced due to the potassium bonds. Illite originates from the modification of mica, a primary mineral. It is often found together with montmorillonite and its primary minerals. It has moderate CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Vermiculite''' is a mica-based clay similar to illite, but the crystals of clay are held together more loosely by hydrated magnesium and it will swell, but not as much as does montmorillonite. It has very high CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=73}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Chlorite''' is similar to vermiculite, but the loose bonding by occasional hydrated magnesium, as in vermiculite, is replaced by a hydrated magnesium sheet, that firmly bonds the planes above and below it. It has two planes of silicon, one of aluminium and one of magnesium; hence it is a 2:2 clay. Chlorite does not swell and it has low CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|p=112}}
* '''Kaolinite''' is very common, highly weathered clay, and more common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even heavier weathering results in sesquioxide clays.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=33}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=101}}

[[File:San Joaquin soil profile.png|thumb|right|silica-sesquioxide]]

====Crystalline chain clays====
The carbonate and sulfate minerals are much more soluble and hence are found primarily in desert soils where leaching is less active.

====Amorphous clays====
'''Amorphous clays''' are young, and commonly found in volcanic ash. They are mixtures of alumina and silica which have not formed the ordered crystal shape of alumino-silica clays which time would provide. The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH. They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions. As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}

====Sesquioxide clays====
'''[[Sesquioxide]] clays''' are a product of heavy rainfall that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It takes hundreds of thousands of years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. ''Sesqui'' is Latin for "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=103–12}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=18, 21–24, 29}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32, 35}}

===Organic colloids===
[[Humus]] is the final state of decomposition of organic matter. While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary. It is composed of the very stable [[lignin]]s (30%) and complex sugars ([[polyuronide]]s, 30%), proteins (30%), waxes, and fats that are resistant to breakdown by microbes. Its chemical assay is 60% carbon, 5% nitrogen, some oxygen and the remainder hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=112}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=35}}{{sfn|Allaway|1957|p=69}}

===Carbon and terra preta===
In the extreme environment of high temperatures and the leaching caused by the heavy rain of tropical rain forests, the clay and organic colloids are largely destroyed. The heavy rains wash the alumino-silicate clays from the soil leaving only sesquioxide clays of low CEC. The high temperatures and humidity allow bacteria and fungi to virtually dissolve any organic matter on the rain-forest floor overnight and much of the nutrients are volatilized or leached from the soil and lost. However, carbon in the form of charcoal is far more stable than soil colloids and is capable of performing many of the functions of the soil colloids of sub-tropical soils. Soil containing substantial quantities of charcoal, of an anthropogenic origin, is called [[terra preta]]. Research into terra preta is still young but is promising. Fallow periods "on the Amazonian Dark Earths can be as short as 6 months, whereas fallow periods on [[oxisol]]s are usually 8 to 10 years long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Terra Preta de Indio|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|publisher=University of Cornell, Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424061552/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{for|the [[academic discipline]]|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its microbial population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water. It is the surface chemistry of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties. "A colloid is a small, insoluble, nondiffusible particle larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in a fluid medium without settling. Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays." The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net charges, gives soil its ability to hold and release ions. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release cations in what is referred to as cation exchange. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release anions in the soil giving the soil [[cation-exchange capacity|anion exchange capacity]] (AEC).

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, buffers (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies percolating water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–06}}

# Isomorphous substitution occurs in clay during its formation, when lower-valence cations substitute for higher-valence cations in the crystal structure. Substitutions in the outermost layers are more effective than for the innermost layers, as the charge strength drops off as the square of the distance. The net result is oxygen atoms with net negative charge and the ability to attract cations.
# Edge-of-clay oxygen atoms are not in balance ionically as the tetrahedral and octahedral structures are incomplete.
# Hydroxyls may substitute for oxygens of the silica layers. When the hydrogens of the clay hydroxyls are ionised into solution, they leave the oxygen with a negative charge.
# Hydrogens of humus hydroxyl groups may be ionised into solution, leaving an oxygen with a negative charge.

Cations held to the negatively charged colloids resist being washed downward by water and out of reach of plants' roots, thereby preserving the fertility of soils in areas of moderate rainfall and low temperatures.

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as they differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another. If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; same as NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called mass action. This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low pH, and an abundance of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy those sites. A low pH may cause hydrogen of hydroxyl groups to be pulled into solution, leaving charged sites on the colloid available to be occupied by other cations. This ionisation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of soil colloids creates what is described as pH-dependent charges. Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Freed cations can be made available to plants but are also prone to be leached from the soil, possibly making the soil less fertile. Plants are able to excrete H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the soil and by that means, change the pH of the soil near the root and push cations off the colloids, thus making those available to the plant.

====Cation exchange capacity (CEC)====
Cation exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that will combine with 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (1&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of dry soil or 20&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=114}} The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.

Most of the soil's CEC occurs on clay and humus colloids, and the lack of those in hot, humid, wet climates, due to leaching and decomposition respectively, explains the relative sterility of tropical soils. Live plant roots also have some CEC.

====Anion exchange capacity (AEC)====
Anion exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove anions from the soil water solution and sequester those for later exchange as the plant roots release carbonate anions to the soil water solution. Those colloids which have low CEC tend to have some AEC. Amorphous and sesquioxide clays have the highest AEC, followed by the iron oxides. Levels of AEC are much lower than for CEC. Phosphates tend to be held at anion exchange sites.

Iron and aluminum hydroxide clays are able to exchange their hydroxide anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) for other anions. The order reflecting the strength of anion adhesion is as follows:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The amount of exchangeable anions is of a magnitude of tenths to a few milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;g dry soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=115–16}} As pH rises, there are relatively more hydroxyls, which will displace anions from the colloids and force them into solution and out of storage; hence AEC decreases with increasing pH (alkalinity).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−3.5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (hydrogen ions) per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−10.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole/litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−9.5&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−2.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole per litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydrogen ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5  = 6 or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) and is more acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0394329833|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of pH on a soil is to remove from the soil or to make available certain ions. Soils with high acidity tend to have toxic amounts of aluminium and manganese. Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils. Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&amp;nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&amp;nbsp;5.5.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–17}}

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain as those attach to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil sterile. Once the colloids are saturated with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH&amp;nbsp;10. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–19}}

====Base saturation percentage====
There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) and there are base-forming cations. The fraction of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base saturation percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100&amp;nbsp;percent and there are no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=119–20}}

===Buffering===
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, while soils high in colloids have high buffering capacity. Buffering occurs by cation exchange and neutralisation.

The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will displace hydrogen ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–21}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Plant nutrition|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Sixteen elements or nutrients are essential for plant growth and reproduction. They are [[carbon]] '''C''', [[hydrogen]] '''H''', [[oxygen]] '''O''', [[nitrogen]] '''N''', [[phosphorus]] '''P''', [[potassium]] '''K''', [[sulfur]] '''S''', [[calcium]] '''Ca''', [[magnesium]] '''Mg''', [[iron]] '''Fe''', [[boron]] '''B''', [[manganese]] '''Mn''', [[copper]] '''Cu''', [[zinc]] '''Zn''', [[molybdenum]] '''Mo''', [[nickel]] '''Ni''' and [[chlorine]] '''Cl'''.{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Russel|1957|pp=123–25}}&lt;ref name = BradyWeil&gt;{{cite book | title = The nature and properties of soils | year = 2008 | edition = 14th | last1 = Brady | first1 = Nyle C. | last2 = Weil | first2 = Ray R. | publisher = Pearson | location = Upper Saddle River, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients required for plants to complete their life cycle are considered '''essential nutrients'''. Nutrients that enhance the growth of plants but are not necessary to complete the plant's life cycle are considered '''non-essential'''. With the exception of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are supplied by carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen, provided through [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; the nutrients derive originally from the mineral component of the soil.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they [[weathering|weather]] too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, The application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=|isbn=978-9251054901|location=Rome|pages=43–90|chapter=Chapter 4: Soil fertility and crop production|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram for gram, the capacity of humus to hold nutrients and water is far greater than that of clay minerals. All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–31}}&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;

===Uptake processes===
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots. To be taken up by a plant, a nutrient element must be located near the root surface; however, the supply of nutrients in contact with the root is rapidly depleted. There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:

# Mass flow of water
# Diffusion within water
# Interception by root growth

All three mechanisms operate simultaneously, but one mechanism or another may be most important for a particular nutrient. For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface. However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion of molecules. By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as transpiration has almost stopped. Finally, root interception comes into play as roots continually grow into new, undepleted soil.

In the above table, phosphorus and potassium nutrients move more by diffusion than they do by mass flow in the soil water solution, as they are rapidly taken up by the roots creating a concentration of almost zero near the roots (the plants cannot transpire enough water to draw more of those nutrients near the roots). The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement by mass flow requires the transpiration of water from the plant causing water and solution ions to also move toward the roots. Movement by root interception is slowest as the plants must extend their roots.

Plants move ions out of their roots in an effort to move nutrients in from the soil. Hydrogen H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is exchanged for other cations, and carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are exchanged for nutrient anions. As plant roots remove nutrients from the soil water solution, they are replenished as other ions move off of clay and humus (by [[ion exchange]] or [[desorption]]), are added from the [[weathering]] of soil minerals, and are released by the [[Soil organic matter#Decomposition|decomposition of soil organic matter]]. Plants derive a large proportion of their anion nutrients from decomposing organic matter, which typically holds about 95&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil nitrogen, 5 to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil phosphorus and about 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil sulfur. Where crops are produced, the replenishment of nutrients in the soil must usually be augmented by the addition of fertilizer or organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=126}}

Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake. Examples of such conditions include [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] or [[soil compaction]] resulting in poor soil aeration, excessively high or low soil temperatures, and above-ground conditions that result in low translocation of sugars to plant roots.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–28}}

===Carbon===
[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring soil respiration in the field using an SRS2000 system.]]
Plants obtain their carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's dry mass is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released as a byproduct which then finds its way out of the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=41}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|p=153}}

===Nitrogen===
{{Further|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:SoilNitrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Generalization of percent soil nitrogen by soil order}}]]
Nitrogen is the most critical element obtained by plants from the soil and [[nitrogen deficiency]] often limits plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=128}} Plants can use the nitrogen as either the ammonium cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the anion nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants. The total nitrogen content depends largely on the soil organic matter content, which in turn depends on the climate, vegetation, topography, age and soil management. Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils. Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.

Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the form of ammonia in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Both ammonium and nitrate can be ''immobilized'' by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered in the form of amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''. Nitrogen may also be ''leached'' from the soil if it is in the form of nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called ''volatilisation''. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by ''fixation''. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Allison|1957|pp=85–94}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|pp=152–55}}{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–31}}

====Gains====
In the process of [[mineralization (soil)|mineralisation]], microbes feed on organic matter, releasing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and other nutrients. As long as the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fresh residues in the soil is above 30:1, nitrogen will be in short supply and other bacteria will feed on the ammonium and incorporate its nitrogen into their cells in the [[immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]] process. In that form the nitrogen is said to be ''immobilised''. Later, when such bacteria die, they too are ''mineralised'' and some of the nitrogen is released as ammonium and nitrate. If the C/N is less than 15, ammonia is freed to the soil, where it may be used by bacteria which [[redox|oxidise]] it to nitrate ([[nitrification]]). Bacteria may on average add {{convert|25|lb}} nitrogen per acre, and in an unfertilised field, this is the most important source of usable nitrogen. In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition. It occurs fastest in warm, moist, well aerated soil. The mineralisation of 3% of the organic material of a soil that is 4% organic matter overall, would release {{convert|120|lb}} of nitrogen as ammonium per acre.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=129–30}}

[[Rhizobia]] share a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment. It is estimated that such symbiotic bacteria in the [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s add 45 to 250&amp;nbsp;pounds of nitrogen per acre per year, which may be sufficient for the crop. Other, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and [[blue-green algae]] live independently in the soil and release nitrate when their dead bodies are converted by way of mineralisation.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–29}}

Some amount of usable nitrogen is fixed by [[lightning]] as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide is soluble in water to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, previously released from the soil or from combustion, may fall with precipitation as nitric acid at a rate of about five pounds nitrogen per acre per year.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=87}}

====Sequestration====
When bacteria feed on soluble forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), they temporarily sequester that nitrogen in their bodies in a process called ''immobilisation''. At a later time when those bacteria die, their nitrogen may be released as ammonium by the processes of mineralisation.

Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers. The layers are small enough that bacteria cannot enter. Some organisms can exude extracellular enzymes that can act on the sequestered proteins. However, those enzymes too may be trapped on the clay crystals.

Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes [[potassium]] ions from between the layers of clay such as [[illite]] or [[montmorillonite]]. Only a small fraction of soil nitrogen is held this way.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}

====Losses====
Usable nitrogen may be lost from soils when it is in the form of nitrate, as it is easily [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]]. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This occurs when poor [[soil aeration]] limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of nitrate applied as fertiliser may occur.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=130}}

''Ammonium volatilisation'' occurs when ammonium reacts chemically with an alkaline soil, converting NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of ammonium fertiliser to such a field can result in volatilisation losses of as much as 30 percent.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Phosphorus===
After nitrogen, phosphorus is probably the element most likely to be deficient in soils. The soil mineral [[apatite]] is the most common mineral source of phosphorus. While there is on average 1000&amp;nbsp;lb of phosphorus per acre in the soil, it is generally in the form of phosphates with low solubility. Total phosphorus is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent by weight of the soil, but only one percent of that is available. Of the part available, more than half comes from the mineralisation of organic matter. Agricultural fields may need to be fertilised to make up for the phosphorus that has been removed in the crop.{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}

When phosphorus does form solubilised ions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, they rapidly form insoluble phosphates of calcium or hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil and is not leached but actually builds up in the surface layer if not cropped. The application of soluble fertilisers to soils may result in zinc deficiencies as zinc phosphates form. Conversely, the application of zinc to soils may immobilise phosphorus again as zinc phosphate. Lack of phosphorus may interfere with the normal opening of the plant leaf stomata, resulting in plant temperatures 10 percent higher than normal. Phosphorus is most available when soil pH is 6.5 in mineral soils and 5.5 in organic soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Potassium===
The amount of potassium in a soil may be as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb per acre-foot, of which only 150&amp;nbsp;lb is available for plant growth. Common mineral sources of potassium are the mica [[biotite]] and potassium feldspar, KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. When solubilised, half will be held as exchangeable cations on clay while the other half is in the soil water solution. Potassium fixation often occurs when soils dry and the potassium is bonded between layers of illite clay. Under certain conditions, dependent on the soil texture, intensity of drying, and initial amount of exchangeable potassium, the fixed percentage may be as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent within ten minutes. Potassium may be leached from soils low in clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|pp=101–04}}

===Calcium===
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant in the form of exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=135–36}}

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is one of the dominant exchangeable cations in most soils (as are calcium and potassium). Primary minerals that weather to release magnesium include [[hornblende]], [[biotite]] and [[vermiculite]]. Soil magnesium concentrations are generally sufficient for optimal plant growth, but highly weathered and sandy soils may be magnesium deficient due to leaching by heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}}

===Sulfur===
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}} Deficiencies may exist in some soils (especially sandy soils) and if cropped, sulfur needs to be added. The application of large quantities of nitrogen to fields that have marginal amounts of sulfur may cause sulfur deficiency in the rapidly growing plants by the plant's growth outpacing the supply of sulfur. A 15-ton crop of onions uses up to 19&amp;nbsp;lb of sulfur and 4&amp;nbsp;tons of alfalfa uses 15&amp;nbsp;lb per acre. Sulfur abundance varies with depth. In a sample of soils in Ohio, United States, the sulfur abundance varied with depths, 0-6&amp;nbsp;inches, 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches, 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches, 18-24&amp;nbsp;inches in the amounts: 1056, 830, 686, 528&amp;nbsp;lb per acre respectively.{{sfn|Jordan|Reisenauer|1957|p=107}}

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients essential in plant life, in their order of importance, include  [[iron]],{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|pp=111}} [[manganese]],{{sfn|Sherman|1957|p=135}} [[zinc]],{{sfn|Seatz|Jurinak|1957|p=115}} [[copper]],{{sfn|Reuther|1957|p=128}} [[boron]],{{sfn|Russel|1957|p=121}} [[chlorine]]{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=146}} and [[molybdenum]].{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=141}} The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil. They are required in very small amounts but are essential to plant health in that most are required parts of some enzyme system which speeds up plants' metabolisms. They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates. Iron deficiency may also result from excessive amounts of heavy metals or calcium minerals (lime) in the soil. Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=107}}

===Non-essential nutrients===
Nutrients which enhance the health but whose deficiency does not stop the life cycle of plants include: [[cobalt]], [[strontium]], [[vanadium]], [[silicon]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria Pereira|first1=B.F.|title=Nutrients and Nonessential Elements in Soil after 11 Years of Wastewater Irrigation|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/3/920|website=ACSESS Digital Library|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their importance are evaluated they may be added to the list of essential plant nutrients.

==Soil organic matter==
{{main|Soil organic matter}}
Soil organic matter is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead. A typical soil has a biomass composition of 70% microorganisms, 22% macrofauna, and 8% roots. The living component of an acre of soil may include 900&amp;nbsp;lb of earthworms, 2400&amp;nbsp;lb of fungi, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb of bacteria, 133&amp;nbsp;lb of protozoa and 890&amp;nbsp;lb of arthropods and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pimentel, D.|display-authors=etal|year=1995|title=Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|pages=1117–22|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1117P |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5201.1117|issue=24|pmid=17789193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small part of the organic matter consists of the living cells such as bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes that work to break down the dead organic matter. Were it not for the action of these micro-organisms, the entire carbon dioxide part of the atmosphere would be sequestered as organic matter in the soil.

Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:

# Polysaccharides
## cellulose
## hemicellulose
## starch
## pectin
# Lignins
# Proteins

Most living things in soils, including plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on the temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by amoebas, which in turn are fed upon by nematodes and arthropods. Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.&lt;ref name=Foth1984&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foth | first = Henry D. | year = 1984 | title = Fundamentals of soil science | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0471889267 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

===Humus===
[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown. Humus usually constitutes only five percent of the soil or less by volume, but it is an essential source of nutrients and adds important textural qualities crucial to [[soil health]] and plant growth. Humus also hold bits of undecomposed organic matter which feed arthropods and worms which further improve the soil. The end product, humus, is soluble in water and forms a weak acid that can attack silicate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilluly, Waters, Woodford|title=Principles of Geology|year=1975|edition=4th|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=USA|isbn=978-0716702696|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humus is a colloid with a high cation and anion exchange capacity that on a dry weight basis is many times greater than that of clay colloids. It also acts as a buffer, like clay, against changes in pH and soil moisture.

[[Humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, which begin as raw organic matter, are important constituents of humus. After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.

Lignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.&lt;ref name=Verkaik2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) forests |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=287 |pages=337–45 |doi=10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8 |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/25615 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierer2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fierer |first=N. |last2=Schimel |first2=Joshua P. |last3=Cates |first3=Rex G. |last4=Zou |first4=Jiping |title=Influence of balsam poplar tannin fractions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Alaskan taiga floodplain soils |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=2001 |volume=33 |pages=1827–39 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00111-0 |issue=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].&lt;ref name="Foth1984"/&gt; Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.

===Climatological influence===
The production, accumulation and degradation of organic matter are greatly dependent on climate. Temperature, soil moisture and [[topography]] are the major factors affecting the accumulation of organic matter in soils. Organic matter tends to accumulate under wet or cold conditions where [[decomposer]] activity is impeded by low temperature&lt;ref name="Wagai2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagai |first=Rota |last2=Mayer |first2=Lawrence M. |last3=Kitayama |first3=Kanehiro |last4=Knicker |first4=Heike |date=2008 |title=Climate and parent material controls on organic matter storage in surface soils: A three-pool, density-separation approach |journal=Geoderma |volume=147 |issue=1–2 |pages=23–33 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.07.010|bibcode=2008Geode.147...23W |url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/82461/1/Acceso%20restringido%20Digital%20CSIC.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript |hdl=10261/82461 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or excess moisture which results in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name="Minayeva2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minayeva |first=T.

Lignin undergoes very slow decomposition, mainly by [[white rot]] fungi and [[actinomycetes]]; its half-life under temperate conditions is about six months.&lt;ref name=Paul1997 /&gt;

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a [[soil horizon]]. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers&lt;ref name=Retallack1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Retallack | first = G. J.| year = 1990| title = Soils of the past : an introduction to paleopedology| page = 32| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YVkVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Soil+horizons| isbn = 978-0044457572| publisher = Unwin Hyman| location = Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe the horizon in terms of its colour, size, texture, structure, consistency, root quantity, pH, voids, boundary characteristics and presence of nodules or concretions.&lt;ref name=Buol1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Buol | first = S.W.| year = 1990| title = Soil genesis and classification| page = 36| doi = 10.1081/E-ESS| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QM0kfIGYMjcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Soil| isbn = 978-0813828732| location = Ames, Iowa| publisher = Iowa State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; No soil profile has all the major horizons. Some may have only one horizon.

The exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

Soil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref name=IUSS2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=IUSS Working Group WRB|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014.

====United States====
{{Main|USDA soil taxonomy#Orders}}

A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html The Soil Orders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112143347/http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html |date=12 January 2010 }}, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=411–32}}  The names of the orders end with the suffix ''-sol''.

* [[Alfisol]] – soils with [[aluminium]] and [[iron]]. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* [[Andisol]] – volcanic ash soils. They are young and very fertile. They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
* [[Aridisol]] – dry soils forming under [[desert]] conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of [[caliche]] or [[duripan]]. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* [[Entisol]] – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* [[Gelisol]] – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* [[Histosol]] – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* [[Inceptisol]] – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* [[Mollisol]] – soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* [[Oxisol]] – are heavily [[weathered]], are rich in iron and aluminum oxides ([[sesquioxides]]) or [[kaolin]] but low in [[silica]]. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low [[Cation-exchange capacity|CEC]] of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* [[Spodosol]] – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* [[Ultisol]] – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (important [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]). They are highly [[weathered]], but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* [[Vertisol]] – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

"Soils of Mountains", which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as "Rugged Mountains" which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The '''soil suborders''' within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of '''soil subgroups''': typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

A '''soil family''' category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale's precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=409–10}}

A family may contain several '''soil series''' which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the [[Merrimack River]] in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

A '''soil phase of series''', originally called 'soil type' describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants; however, as demonstrated by [[hydroponics]], it is not essential to plant growth if the soil-contained nutrients can be dissolved in a solution. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated.

Soil material is also a critical component in the mining, construction and landscape development industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Soils for Landscape Development |author1=Leake, Simon|author2=Haege, Elke|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0643109643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects. The movement of massive volumes of soil can be involved in [[surface mining]], road building and dam construction. [[Earth sheltering]] is the architectural practice of using soil for external [[thermal mass]] against building walls. Many [[building material]]s are soil based.

Soil resources are critical to the environment, as well as to food and fibre production. Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later, thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans water as it percolates through it. Soil is the habitat for many organisms: the major part of known and unknown [[biodiversity]] is in the soil, in the form of [[invertebrates]] ([[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[mite]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[Enchytraeidae|enchytraeids]], [[nematode]]s, [[protist]]s), [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], fungi and [[algae]]; and most organisms living above ground have part of them ([[plants]]) or spend part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[insects]]) below-ground. Above-ground and below-ground biodiversities are tightly interconnected,&lt;ref name="Ponge2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ponge| first = Jean-François| year = 2003| title = Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity| journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume = 35| issue = 7| pages = 935–45| doi = 10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| format = PDF| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| archivedate = 29 January 2016| df = dmy-all| citeseerx = 10.1.1.467.4937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Deyn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Deyn |first=Gerlinde B. |last2=Van der Putten |first2=Wim H. |date=2005 |title=Linking aboveground and belowground diversity |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |pages=625–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.009 |pmid=16701446 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making soil protection of paramount importance for any restoration or conservation plan.

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even on desert crusts, cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by photosynthesis. Poor farming and grazing methods have degraded soils and released much of this sequestered carbon to the atmosphere. Restoring the world's soils could offset the effect of increases in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and slow global warming, while improving crop yields and reducing water needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Hansen, J. |display-authors = etal |journal=Open Atmospheric Science Journal|year=2008|volume= 2|issue = 1 |pages= 217–31 | title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|arxiv = 0804.1126 |bibcode = 2008OASJ....2..217H |doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using aerobic soil processes. [[Landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]]. Land application of waste water relies on soil biology to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

Organic soils, especially [[peat]], serve as a significant fuel resource; but wide areas of peat production, such as [[sphagnum]] [[bog]]s, are now protected because of patrimonial interest.

[[Geophagy]] is the practice of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes. It has been shown that some [[monkeys]] consume soil, together with their preferred food (tree [[foliage]] and [[fruits]]), in order to alleviate [[tannin]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Setz1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Setz| first = EZF| authorlink =  |author2=Enzweiler J |author3=Solferini VN |author4=Amendola MP |author5=Berton RS | year = 1999| title = Geophagy in the golden-faced saki monkey (Pithecia pithecia chrysocephala) in the Central Amazon| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 247| issue=1|pages = 91–103| doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1999.tb00196.x | url = https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/1059/Setz-et-al-1999.pdf| format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils filter and purify water and affect its chemistry. Rain water and pooled water from ponds, lakes and rivers percolate through the soil horizons and the upper [[Stratum|rock strata]], thus becoming groundwater. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] ([[virus]]es) and [[pollutant]]s, such as persistent organic pollutants ([[chlorinated]] [[pesticide]]s, [[polychlorinated biphenyls]]), oils ([[hydrocarbon]]s), heavy metals ([[lead]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]]), and excess nutrients ([[nitrate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, [[phosphate]]s) are filtered out by the soil.&lt;ref name="Kohne2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kohne |first=John Maximilian |last2=Koehne |first2=Sigrid |last3=Simunek |first3=Jirka |date=2009 |title=A review of model applications for structured soils: a) Water flow and tracer transport |journal=Journal of Contaminant Hydrology |volume=104 |pages=4–35 |doi=10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.10.002 |pmid=19012994 |issue=1–4 |bibcode=2009JCHyd.104....4K |url=http://www.soil.tu-bs.de/lehre/Master.Monitoring/2009/Daten/5_Literatur/A%20review%20of-Koehne-2009.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107005433/http://www.soil.tu-bs.de/lehre/Master.Monitoring/2009/Daten/5_Literatur/A%20review%20of-Koehne-2009.pdf |archivedate=7 November 2017 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.468.9149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil organisms [[metabolise]] them or immobilise them in their [[biomass]] and necromass,&lt;ref name="Diplock2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Diplock| first = EE| authorlink =  |author2=Mardlin DP |author3=Killham KS |author4=Paton GI | year = 2009| title = Predicting bioremediation of hydrocarbons: laboratory to field scale| journal = Environmental Pollution| volume = 157| pages = 1831–40| doi = 10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.022| pmid = 19232804| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby incorporating them into stable humus.&lt;ref name="Moeckel2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moeckel |first=Claudia |last2=Nizzetto |first2=Luca |last3=Di Guardo |first3=Antonio |last4=Steinnes |first4=Eiliv |last5=Freppaz |first5=Michele |last6=Filippa |first6=Gianluca |last7=Camporini |first7=Paolo |last8=Benner |first8=Jessica |last9=Jones |first9=Kevin C.  |date=2008 |title=Persistent organic pollutants in boreal and montane soil profiles: distribution, evidence of processes and implications for global cycling |journal=Environmental Science and Technology |volume=42 |pages=8374–80 |doi=10.1021/es801703k |pmid=19068820 |issue=22 |bibcode=2008EnST...42.8374M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical integrity of soil is also a prerequisite for avoiding landslides in rugged landscapes.&lt;ref name="Rezaei2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rezaei |first=Khalil |last2=Guest |first2=Bernard |last3=Friedrich |first3=Anke |last4=Fayazi |first4=Farajollah |last5=Nakhaei |first5=Mohamad |last6=Aghda |first6=Seyed Mahmoud Fatemi |last7=Beitollahi |first7=Ali |date=2009 |title=Soil and sediment quality and composition as factors in the distribution of damage at the December 26, 2003, Bam area earthquake in SE Iran (M (s)=6.6) |journal=Journal of Soils and Sediments |volume=9 |pages=23–32 |doi=10.1007/s11368-008-0046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a human-induced or natural process which impairs the capacity of [[land (economics)|land]] to function. Soils degradation involves the [[Soil acidification|acidification]], [[soil contamination|contamination]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]] or [[Soil salinity|salination]].

[[Soil acidification]] is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion. Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].

[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation.

[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.

Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602–10 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | postscript = . | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater.

==Reclamation==
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.&lt;ref name="Water Management Institute2010"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |author=International Water Management Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition. Adding organic matter (like [[ramial chipped wood]] for instance) to soil which is depleted in nutrients and too high in sand will boost its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Provide for your garden's basic needs ... and the plants will take it from there|date=10 March 2011|journal=USA Weekend|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209012951/http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Solar power''' is the [[energy transformation|conversion of energy]] from [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]], or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use [[lens (optics)|lens]]es or [[mirrors]] and [[solar tracking|tracking systems]] to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an [[electric current]] using the [[photovoltaic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414081047/http://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of [[electricity]] for small and medium-sized applications, from the [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculator]] powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an [[off-grid]] rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility|Ivanpah]] installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world, located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[California]].

As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness [[renewable energy]] from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850&amp;nbsp;MW [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park, in [[Qinghai]], [[China]].

The [[International Energy Agency]] projected in 2014 that under its "high renewables" scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the [[worldwide electricity consumption]], and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing at 35% per annum.&lt;ref name=bp2018&gt;[https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html BP Global: Solar energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mainstream technologies ==

Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels ''(see [[solar power by country]])''. Long distance transmission allows remote [[renewable energy]] resources to displace fossil fuel consumption. Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

=== Photovoltaics ===
{{Main|Photovoltaics}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Schematics of a grid-connected residential [[PV power system]]&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2"&gt;Solar Cells and their Applications Second Edition, Lewis Fraas, Larry Partain, Wiley, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-470-44633-1}} , Section10.2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A [[solar cell]], or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The German industrialist [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power|journal=Popular Science |date = June 1931|accessdate=19 April 2011|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[silicon]] solar cell in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These early solar cells cost 286&amp;nbsp;USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29–30, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The array of a [[photovoltaic power system]], or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. 
For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), through the use of [[Solar inverter|inverters]].&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt; 
Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. 
Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt;

Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets.&lt;ref name="IEAPVPS2009_Fig3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications Survey report of selected IEA countries between 1992 and 2009, IEA-PVPS | accessdate=8 November 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165534/http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | archivedate=25 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In these [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected PV systems]], use of energy storage is optional. 
In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such [[stand-alone power system]]s permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.

=== Concentrated solar power ===
{{Main|Concentrated solar power}}
[[File:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A [[parabolic trough|parabolic collector]] concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point.]]

Concentrated solar power (CSP), also called "concentrated solar thermal", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight, then use the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines.

A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the [[parabolic trough]], the [[compact linear Fresnel reflector]], the [[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Stirling dish]] and the [[solar power tower]]. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|title=Spanish CSP Plant with Storage Produces Electricity for 24 Hours Straight|author=Stephen Lacey|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112224/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''parabolic trough'' consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned along the focal points of the linear parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | title=Concentrated Solar Thermal Power – Now | accessdate=19 August 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052050/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | archivedate=10 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] plants in California and Acciona's [[Nevada Solar One]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]] are representatives of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UNLV Solar Site |publisher = University of Las Vegas |url = http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |accessdate = 2 July 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060903112910/http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |archivedate = 3 September 2006 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors'' are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |title = Compact CLFR |publisher = Physics.usyd.edu.au |date = 12 June 2002 |accessdate = 19 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110412235037/http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |archivedate = 12 April 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |title=Ausra compact CLFR introducing cost-saving solar rotation features |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150750/http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Stirling solar dish'' combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a [[Stirling engine]] which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.
Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = An Assessment of Solar Energy Conversion Technologies and Research Opportunities |publisher = Stanford University – Global Climate Change &amp; Energy Project |url = http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |accessdate = 2 July 2008 |format = PDF |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509182125/http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |archivedate = 9 May 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[The Big Dish (solar thermal)|Big Dish]] in [[Canberra]], Australia is an example of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentrating Solar Power in 2001 – An IEA/SolarPACES Summary of Present Status and Future Prospects |publisher=International Energy Agency – SolarPACES |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052052/http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''solar power tower'' uses an array of tracking reflectors ([[heliostat]]s) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers can achieve higher (thermal-to-electricity conversion) efficiency than linear tracking CSP schemes and better energy storage capability than dish stirling technologies.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt; The [[PS10 Solar Power Plant]] and [[PS20 solar power plant]] are examples of this technology.

=== Hybrid systems ===

A hybrid system combines (C)PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and [[biogas]]. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.

; CPV/CSP system
: A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed, combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar power, or also known as concentrated solar thermal.&lt;ref&gt;Phys.org [http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system proposed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822040505/http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html |date=22 August 2015 }}, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|ISCC]] system
: The [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station|Hassi R'Mel power station]] in Algeria, is an example of combining CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-[[parabolic trough]] array supplements a much larger 130&amp;nbsp;MW [[combined cycle|combined cycle gas turbine plant]]. Another example is the [[Yazd integrated solar combined cycle power station|Yazd power station]] in Iran.
; [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|PVT system]]
: Hybrid PV/T), also known as ''photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors'' convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. Such a system combines a solar (PV) module with a [[solar thermal collector]] in a complementary way.
; [[Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal|CPVT system]]
: A concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid (CPVT) system is similar to a PVT system. It uses [[concentrated photovoltaic]]s (CPV) instead of conventional PV technology, and combines it with a solar thermal collector.
; [[PV diesel system]]

: Thermoelectric, or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current. Solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation, while the low frequency heat energy is wasted. Several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{citation

The idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar/thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity.

=== Early days ===

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. [[Charles Fritts]] installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient [[selenium]] cells, on a New York City roof in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|title=Photovoltaic Dreaming 1875--1905: First Attempts At Commercializing PV - CleanTechnica|author=|date=|website=cleantechnica.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525170459/https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 63, 77, 101&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems.&lt;ref&gt;"The Solar Energy Book-Once More." ''[[Mother Earth News]]'' 31:16–17, Jan. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–673&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and Germany ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer–ISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | accessdate=4 November 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212091650/http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | archivedate=12 December 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the [[growth of photovoltaics]] from 1984 to 1996.

=== Mid-1990s to early 2010s ===

In the mid-1990s, development of both, residential and commercial [[rooftop solar]] as well as utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, [[Kyoto Protocol|global warming concerns]], and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php Solar: photovoltaic: Lighting Up The World] retrieved 19 May 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813163816/http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php |date=13 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the adoption of [[feed-in tariff]]s—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—led to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.

=== Current status ===
For several years, worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by [[Solar power in the European Union|European deployment]], but has since shifted to Asia, especially [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world, including, but not limited to, [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in Canada|Canada]], [[Solar power in Chile|Chile]], [[Solar power in India|India]], [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]], [[Solar power in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Solar power in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Energy in South Korea|South Korea]], [[Solar power in Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]].

Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40% per year from 2000 to 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and total installed capacity reached 303&amp;nbsp;GW at the end of 2016 with [[Solar power in China|China]] having the most cumulative installations (78&amp;nbsp;GW)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|title=2016 Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets|last=|first=|date=2017|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827050437/http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Renewable energy in Honduras|Honduras]] having the highest theoretical percentage of annual electricity usage which could be generated by solar PV (12.5%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|title=Photovoltaics: Overview of installed PV in 2013|publisher=Renewables International|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330022600/http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest manufacturers are located in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|title=Top-10 solar cell producers in 2016|first=Finlay|last=Colville|work=PV-Tech|date=30 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054912/http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|title=The New Solar System - Executive Summary|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey|last2=et al|date=2017-03-21|website=Stanford University Law School, Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance|access-date=2017-06-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420151310/https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrated solar power (CSP) also started to grow rapidly, increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV.&lt;ref name="ren21-gsr-2014"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 
 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} 
As of the end of 2013, [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|worldwide cumulative CSP-capacity]] reached 3,425&amp;nbsp;MW.

=== Forecasts ===

In 2010, the [[International Energy Agency]] predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3,000 GW or 11% of projected global electricity generation by 2050—enough to generate 4,500&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt-hour|TWh]] of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |title=Solar photovoltaic roadmap |publisher=International Energy Agency |date=2010 |accessdate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042430/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Four years later, in 2014, the agency projected that, under its "high renewables" scenario, solar power could supply 27% of global electricity generation by 2050 (16% from PV and 11% from CSP).&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;

=== Photovoltaic power stations ===
{{Main|List of photovoltaic power stations}}

The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] is a 550&amp;nbsp;MW power plant in [[Riverside County, California]], that uses [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film]] [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe-modules]] made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects |date=30 September 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111021243/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt [[Topaz Solar Farm]] was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW [[Solar Star]] complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park, in [[Gonghe County]], [[Qinghai]], [[China]].

Commercial concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called "solar thermal power stations", were first developed in the 1980s. The 377&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project. Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), and [[Extresol Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5&amp;nbsp;pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;hours of thermal storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand What is peak demand?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811072202/http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand |date=11 August 2012 }}, Energex.com.au website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical cost factors for solar power include the [[Swanson's law|costs of the modules]], the frame to hold them, wiring, inverters, labour cost, any land that might be required, the grid connection, maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive. Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|title=Musk vs. Buffett: The Billionaire Battle to Own the Sun|work=Bloomberg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216024255/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palo Alto]] California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. And in sunny [[Dubai]] large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour – "competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|title=These 4 solar-power stocks will leave fossil fuels in the dust|first=Garvin|last=Jabusch|date=|website=marketwatch.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819230343/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|archivedate=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027231537/http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm |date=27 October 2015 }}, 17 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as [[feed-in tariff|feed-in tariff programs]]. Also, [[Renewable portfolio standard]]s impose a government mandate &lt;!-- Without any discussion of how these mandates impact the economics of solar power, these two sentences discussing RSPs look out of place in this subsection --&gt; that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, [[landfill gas]], ocean, geothermal, [[municipal solid waste]], hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.&lt;ref name="ajelp.com"&gt;Robert Glennon and Andrew M. Reeves, Solar Energy's Cloudy Future, 1 Ariz. J. Evtl. L. &amp; Pol'y, 91, 106 (2010) available at {{cite web|url=http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064518/http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levelized cost of electricity ====

The PV industry is beginning to adopt [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of [[kilowatt-hour]]s (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local [[insolation]], 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a [[capacity factor]] of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by [[European Photovoltaic Industry Association|EPIA]], has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org |title=3rd International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments |publisher=Pvinvestmentconference.org |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114036/http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org/ |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term [[power purchase agreement]]. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | title=Solar Power Services: How PPAs are Changing the PV Value Chain | date=11 February 2008 | accessdate=21 May 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510082253/http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | archivedate=10 May 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi Zhengrong]] has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said "We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies". "Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |title=China’s visible solar power success |author=Mark Clifford |date=8 February 2012 |work=MarketWatch |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801064435/http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Current installation prices ====

In its 2014 edition of the ''Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy'' report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale [[PV system]]s for eight major markets as of 2013 ''(see table below)''.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; However, DOE's [[SVTC Technologies#The SunShot Initiative|SunShot Initiative]] has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt.&lt;ref name="sunshot-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |publisher=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOoaSCpl?url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;GreenTechMedia.com [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 Solar PV Pricing Continues to Fall During a Record-Breaking 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165540/https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 |date=25 May 2017 }}, 13 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |publisher=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kWp amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020014/http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |archivedate=10 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt.

=== Grid parity ===
{{main|Grid parity}}

Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of [[Mains electricity|grid power]], is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 Going for grid parity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |date=8 June 2011 }} 2005 article&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the [[OECD]] countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the [[OECD]] and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of [[power purchase agreement]]s (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, [[grid operator]]s and [[wind turbine manufacturer]]s.&lt;ref name=truecost /&gt;{{dead link|date = June 2015}}

Grid parity was first reached in [[Spain]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/ | title=Solar Grid Parity Comes to Spain | work=Forbes | first=Peter | last=Kelly-Detwiler | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102125458/http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/ | archivedate=2 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaii]] and other islands that otherwise use [[fossil fuel]] ([[diesel fuel]]) to produce electricity, and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9019305&amp;contentId=7035199|title=Gaining on the grid|publisher=BP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081020/http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9019305&amp;contentId=7035199|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/frontiers/STAGING/local_assets/images/fr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&amp;alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity,%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |title=The Path to Grid Parity |publisher=BP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191313/http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets%2Fbp_internet%2Fglobalbp%2Fglobalbp_uk_english%2Freports_and_publications%2Ffrontiers%2FSTAGING%2Flocal_assets%2Fimages%2Ffr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&amp;alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity%2C%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[General Electric]]'s Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015; other companies predicted an earlier date:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|title=Solar power edges towards boom time|author=Reuters Editorial|date=19 October 2007|work=Reuters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722210645/http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|archivedate=22 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the [[OECD]], as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010.&lt;ref name=truecost&gt;[http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm The True Cost of Solar Power] retrieved 22 October 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113041/http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm |date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity by location===
{{see also|Solar irradiance}}
The productivity of solar power in a region depends on [[solar irradiance]], which varies through the day and is influenced by [[latitude]] and [[climate]].

The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics. Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds, and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822174443/http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |archivedate=22 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233148/http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These hot deserts form the ''Global Sun Belt'' circling the world.

=== Self consumption ===

In cases of self consumption of the solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and [[insolation]] of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|title=Money saved by producing electricity from PV and Years for payback|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228114744/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|archivedate=28 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"&gt;{{cite report |title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2014 |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=2014 |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165925/http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt; Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stetz |first=T |last2=Marten |first2=F |last3=Braun |first3=M |title=Improved Low Voltage Grid-Integration of Photovoltaic Systems in Germany |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=534–542 |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2198925|bibcode=2013ITSE....4..534S }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salpakari |first=Jyri |last2=Lund |first2=Peter |title=Optimal and rule-based control strategies for energy flexibility in buildings with PV |journal=Applied Energy |date=2016 |volume=161 |pages=425–436 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good match between generation and consumption is key for high self consumption, and should be considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt; However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase.&lt;ref name="rmi-battery-2015"&gt;{{cite report |last=Fiztgerald |first=Garrett |last2=Mandel |first2=James |last3=Morris |first3=Jesse |last4=Touati |first4=Hervé |title=The Economics of Battery Energy Storage |publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute |date=2015 |url=http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/RMI-TheEconomicsOfBatteryEnergyStorage-FullReport-FINAL.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130145345/http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/RMI-TheEconomicsOfBatteryEnergyStorage-FullReport-FINAL.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot water storage tank]]s with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt; Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt;

=== Energy pricing and incentives ===
{{Main|PV financial incentives}}

The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)

==== Rebates ====

With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Net metering ====
[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]

In [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|title=Net Metering and Interconnection - NJ OCE Web Site|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512060609/http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feed-in tariffs (FIT) ====
{{update section|date=August 2018}}
With [[feed-in tariff]]s, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.

The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|BIPV]] compared to stand alone PV.
* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)
* Italy + EUR 0.04–0.09 kWh
* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)

==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====

Alternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate|SRECs]] allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.

Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],&lt;ref name="German PV market"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power &amp; Energy Technology - IHS Technology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102171748/http://solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|archivedate=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved — Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.

The Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.

Subsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]—that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30–50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic "solar roof" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10–15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free.

In 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate "EPBB" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.

At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&amp;nbsp;MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.

The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, [[energy storage|storing its energy]] is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1976), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.

In an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]). While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|title=California produced so much solar power, electricity prices just turned negative|author=|date=11 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211175722/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|archivedate=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|title=3 Reasons Hawaii Put the Brakes on Solar--and Why the Same Won't Happen in Your State|first=Robert|last=Fares|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920121552/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydro Storage  |publisher=Electricity Storage Association  |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |accessdate=31 July 2008  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |archivedate=21 June 2008  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.

[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the [[The Solar Project|Solar Two]] power station, allowing it to store 1.44&amp;nbsp;[[Terajoules|TJ]] in its 68&amp;nbsp;m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Advantages of Using Molten Salt |publisher = Sandia National Laboratory |url = http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |accessdate = 29 September 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094349/http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archivedate = 5 June 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Photovoltaic system#Standalone system|stand alone PV systems]] [[rechargeable batteries|batteries]] are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system]], excess electricity can be sent to the [[electrical grid]]. [[Net metering]] and [[feed-in tariff]] programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archivedate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]] usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.

Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a “[[plug and play]]” PV microinverter.

Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to [[economies of scale]] provided by large production facilities such as the [[Gigafactory 1]]. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in [[electric car]]s may serve as a future storage devices in a [[vehicle-to-grid]] system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for [[distributed energy storage system|distributed]] PV systems include, [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ETH Zürich, Harvard University |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264239770_The_Economic_Viability_of_Battery_Storage_for_Residential_Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems_-_A_Review_and_a_Simulation_Model |title=The Economic Viability of Battery Storage for Residential Solar Photovoltaic Systems - A Review and a Simulation Model |author1=Joern Hoppmann |author2=Jonas Volland |author3=Tobias S.

The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such [[solar hybrid power systems]] is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|title=Seasonal Energy Storage in a Renewable Energy System|author=|date=|website=semanticscholar.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170317/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |title = The Combined Power Plant: the first stage in providing 100% power from renewable energy |date = January 2008 |accessdate = 10 October 2008 |publisher = SolarServer |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081014054221/http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |archivedate = 14 October 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also undertaken in this field of [[artificial photosynthesis]]. It involves the use of [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce [[hydrogen fuel]] or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as [[methanol]]. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF, Critchley C.

== Environmental impacts ==
[[File:Blick vom aussichtsturm hörlitz4.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Senftenberg Solarpark]], a solar [[photovoltaic]] power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of [[Senftenberg]], in Eastern Germany. The 78 MW Phase 1 of the plant was completed within three months.]]

Unlike [[fossil fuel]] based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.

=== Greenhouse gases ===

The [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar power]] are in the range of 22 to 46&amp;nbsp;gram (g) per [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed, respectively. With this potentially being decreased to 15&amp;nbsp;g/kWh in the future.&lt;ref name="ECN2006"&gt;Alsema, E.A.; Wild – Scholten, M.J. de; Fthenakis, V.M.

The life cycle emission intensity of [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[wind]] and [[nuclear power]] are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]]. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to [[low carbon power]] in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly.&lt;ref name="Solar Energy Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts|title=Portable Solar Panels|work=Portable Solar Panels for Sale|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726034440/http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts/|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([[NREL]]), in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site: GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation.&lt;ref&gt;NREL, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328212706/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf |date=28 March 2015 }}, NREL/FS-6A20-57187, Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45&amp;nbsp;g{{CO2}}e/kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400&amp;nbsp;kWh/m2/year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32&amp;nbsp;g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;David D.

The [[New Zealand]] [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |title= Electric cars not solar panels, says Environment Commissioner |publisher= Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date= 22 March 2016 |accessdate= 23 March 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160403033039/http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |archivedate= 3 April 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy payback ===

The [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]] (EPBT) of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Photovoltaics Report  |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE  |pages=28–32  |accessdate=31 August 2014  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SFRTUaBS?url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |archivedate=31 August 2014  |date=28 July 2014  |deadurl=no  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blakers and Klaus Weber, [http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm "The Energy Intensity of Photovoltaic Systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717213134/http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm |date=17 July 2012 }}, Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Australian National University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for [[crystalline silicon]] PV systems&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; and 1–1.5 years for thin film technologies (S. Europe).&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; These figures fell to 0.75–3.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jinqing Peng, Lin Lu, Hongxing Yang, ''Review on lifecycle assessment of energy payback and greenhouse gas emission of solar photovoltaic systems''.

Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the [[EROEI|energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) or [[EROEI|energy return on investment]] (EROI),&lt;ref&gt;C. Reich-Weiser, D. Dornfeld, and S. Horne.

===Water use===
Solar power includes plants with among the lowest water consumption per unit of electricity (photovoltaic), and also power plants with among the highest water consumption (concentrating solar power with wet-cooling systems).

Photovoltaic power plants use very little water for operations. Life-cycle water consumption for utility-scale operations is estimated to be 12 gallons per megawatt-hour for flat-panel PV solar. Only wind power, which consumes essentially no water during operations, has a lower water consumption intensity.&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"&gt;Meldrum and others, [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015031;jsessionid=2D46F22833C30A3DBC1482DA94361DAE.c1 "Life cycle water use for electricity generation: a review and harmonization of literature estimates,"] ''Environmental Research Letters'', 2013, v.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems, on the other hand, have the highest water-consumption intensities of any conventional type of electric power plant; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Bracken and others, Concentrating Solar Power and Water Issues in the U.S. Southwest, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A50-61376, March 2015, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210).&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt; A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000614/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=6 April 2015 }}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.&lt;ref&gt;Utility-Scale Solar Power: Responsible Water Resource Management, Solar Energy Industries Association, 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of water consumption is heightened because CSP plants are often located in arid environments where water is scarce.

In 2007, the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf Concentrating Solar Power Commercial Application Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226021735/https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf |date=26 December 2017 }}, US Department of Energy, 20 Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 4 used dry cooling systems. The four dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] near [[Barstow, California]], and the [[Genesis Solar Energy Project]] in [[Riverside County, California]]. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 were wet systems, 7 were dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.

Although many older thermoelectric power plants with once-through cooling or cooling ponds ''use'' more water than CSP, meaning that more water passes through their systems, most of the cooling water returns to the water body available for other uses, and they ''consume'' less water by evaporation. For instance, the median coal power plant in the US with once-through cooling uses 36,350 gal/MWhr, but only 250 gal/MWhr (less than one percent) is lost through evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809222054/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=9 August 2017 }}, NREL, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, the majority of US power plants have used recirculating systems such as cooling towers rather than once-through systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 Many newer power plants have cooling systems that Reuse Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020936/https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 |date=26 December 2017 }}, US EIA, 11 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other issues ===
One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of [[cadmium]] (Cd), a [[toxic heavy metal]] that has the tendency to [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in ecological [[food chain]]s. It is used as semiconductor component in [[cadmium telluride solar cell|CdTe solar cells]] and as buffer layer for certain [[CIGS cell]]s in the form of [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]].&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Werner  |first1=Jürgen H.  |title=Toxic Substances In Photovoltaic Modules  |url=http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |website=postfreemarket.net  |publisher=Institute of Photovoltaics, University of Stuttgart, Germany - The 21st International Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conference 2011 Fukuoka, Japan  |accessdate=23 September 2014  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6So1l9Oko?url=http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |archivedate=23 September 2014  |page=2  |format=PDF  |date=2 November 2011  |deadurl=yes  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The amount of cadmium used in [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film PV modules]] is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 [[microgram]]/kWh over the whole life-cycle.&lt;ref name="ECN2006" /&gt; Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and [[lignite]] combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and [[natural gas]] 0.2 microgram/kWh.

In a [[life-cycle analysis]] it has been noted, that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|title=CdTe PV: Real and Perceived EHS Risks|author=|date=|website=bnl.gov|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627012102/https://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|archivedate=27 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[crystalline silicon]] modules, the [[solder]] material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of [[lead]] (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.&lt;ref name="werner" /&gt;

A 2014-published life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large-scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution-related
environmental impacts. The study found that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;Hertwich and others, [http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf "Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123154831/http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf |date=23 November 2015 }}, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 19 May 2015, v.112 n.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concentrator photovoltaics ===
[[File:3 MW CPV project in Golmud, China.jpg|thumb|[[Concentrator photovoltaics|CPV modules]] on dual axis [[solar tracker]]s in Golmud, China]]

[[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of [[electrical power production]]. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[curved mirror]]s to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction solar cells]]. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a [[solar tracker]] in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;MSU-CSET Participation Archive with notation in the Murray Ledger &amp; Times&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luminescent solar concentrator]]s (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |title = What is a luminescent solar concentrator? |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 5 November 2008 |accessdate = 19 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100310165608/http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |archivedate = 10 March 2010 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, most [[solar panels on spacecraft]] are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the [[inner Solar System]].

=== Floatovoltaics ===

[[Floatovoltaics]] are an emerging form of PV systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds.

'''Sprung mass''' (or '''sprung weight'''), in a [[vehicle]] with a [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], such as an [[automobile]], [[motorcycle]], or a [[tank]], is the portion of the vehicle's total mass that is supported by the suspension, including in most applications approximately half of the weight of the suspension itself. The sprung mass typically includes the body, frame, the internal components, passengers, and [[cargo]], but does not include the mass of the components at the other end of the suspension components (including the [[wheel]]s, wheel bearings, brake rotors, calipers, and/or [[continuous track]]s (also called caterpillar tracks), if any), which are part of the vehicle's [[unsprung mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprung mass and Unsprung mass|url=http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/auto-insight/sprung-mass-and-unsprung-mass/9188/1|publisher=ZigWheels|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger the ratio of sprung mass to unsprung mass, the less the body and vehicle occupants are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large sprung mass to unsprung mass ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

[[Image:IndustrialSwitchgear.JPG|thumb|A section of a large switchgear panel, in this case, used to control on-board casino boat power generation.]]
[[Image:Tram switchgear.JPG|thumb|Tram switchgear]]
[[Image:Hybrid switchgear.jpg|thumb|This circuit breaker uses both SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and air as insulation.]]

In an [[electric power system]], '''switchgear''' is the combination of electrical disconnect switches, [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s or [[circuit breaker]]s used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear [[fault (power engineering)|fault]]s downstream. This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the [[electricity]] supply.

The earliest central power stations used simple open [[knife switch]]es, mounted on insulating panels of [[marble]] or [[asbestos]]. Power levels and voltages rapidly escalated, making opening manually operated switches too dangerous for anything other than [[Galvanic isolation|isolation]] of a de-energized circuit. Oil-filled equipment allowed arc energy to be contained and safely controlled. By the early 20th century, a switchgear line-up would be a metal-enclosed structure with electrically operated switching elements, using oil circuit breakers. Today, oil-filled equipment has largely been replaced by air-blast, vacuum, or [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] equipment, allowing large currents and power levels to be safely controlled by automatic equipment.

High-voltage switchgear was invented at the end of the 19th century for operating [[Electric motor|motors]] and other electric machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB189320069&amp;F=0&amp;QPN=GB189320069 British Pattern GB 20069 ''Improvements in Apparatus for Controlling the Application or Use of Electric Currents of High Tension and Great Quantity'' in 1893], on espacenet.com&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has been improved over time and can now be used with voltages up to 1,100&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref name="1100kV"&gt;Lin Jiming et al., ''Transient characteristics of 1 100 kV circuit-breakers'', ''International Symposium on International Standards for Ultra High Voltage'', Beijing, Juillet 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, switchgear in [[Electrical substation|substations]] are located on both the high- and low-voltage sides of large power [[transformer]]s. The switchgear on the low-voltage side of the transformers may be located in a building, with medium-voltage circuit breakers for distribution circuits, along with metering, control, and protection equipment. For industrial applications, a [[transformer]] and switchgear line-up may be combined in one housing, called a unitized [[electrical substation|substation]] (USS).

==Components==
A switchgear has 2 types of components:
*Power conducting components, such as switches, circuit breakers, fuses, and lightning arrestors, that conduct or interrupt the flow of electrical power.
*[[Control system]]s such as control panels, current transformers, potential transformers, protective relays, and associated circuitry, that monitor, control, and protect the power conducting components.

==Functions==
One of the basic functions of switchgear is protection, which is interruption of short-circuit and overload fault currents while maintaining service to unaffected circuits. Switchgear also provides isolation of circuits from power supplies. Switchgear is also used to enhance system availability by allowing more than one source to feed a load.

==History==
[[Image:Schaltanlage um1910.jpg|thumb|Early switchgear (about 1910)]]
Switchgears are as old as [[electricity generation]]. The first models were very primitive: all components were simply fixed to a wall. Later they were mounted on wooden panels. For reasons of fire protection, the wood was replaced by [[slate]] or [[marble]]. This led to a further improvement, because the switching and measuring devices could be attached to the front, while the wiring was on the back.&lt;ref&gt;(German) Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (ed) ''AEG Hilfsbuch für elektrische Licht- und Kraftanlagen 6th Ed.'', W. Girardet, Essen 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==
Switchgear for lower voltages may be entirely enclosed within a building. For higher voltages (over about 66 kV), switchgear is typically mounted outdoors and insulated by air, although this requires a large amount of space. Gas-insulated switchgear saves space compared with air-insulated equipment, although the equipment cost is higher. Oil insulated switchgear presents an oil spill hazard.

Switches may be manually operated or have motor drives to allow for remote control.

==Circuit breaker types ==
A switchgear may be a simple open-air isolator switch or it may be insulated by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride [[gas]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Other common types are oil or vacuum insulated switchgear.

The combination of equipment within the switchgear enclosure allows them to interrupt fault currents of thousands of amps. A [[circuit breaker]] (within a switchgear enclosure) is the primary component that interrupts fault currents. The quenching of the arc when the circuit breaker pulls apart the contacts (disconnects the circuit) requires careful design. Circuit breakers fall into these six types:

[[File:TMW 50981 Schnittmodell Hochspannung-Leistungschalter HPF500F.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model of an oil-filled high-voltage circuit breaker]]
Oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the oil to blast a jet of oil along the path of the arc. The vapor released by the arcing consists of [[hydrogen gas]].
[[Mineral oil]] has better insulating property than air. Whenever there is a separation of current carrying contacts in the oil, the arc in circuit breaker is initialized at the moment of separation of contacts, and due to this arc the oil is vaporized and decomposed in mostly [[hydrogen gas]] and ultimately creates a hydrogen bubble around the [[electric arc]]. This highly compressed gas bubble around the arc prevents re-striking of the arc after current reaches zero crossing of the cycle. The oil circuit breaker is one of the oldest type of circuit breakers.

===Air===
Air circuit breakers may use compressed air (puff) or the magnetic force of the arc itself to elongate the arc. As the length of the sustainable arc is dependent on the available voltage, the elongated arc will eventually exhaust itself. Alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.

Circuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current flow very quickly: typically between 30&amp;nbsp;ms and 150&amp;nbsp;ms depending upon the age and construction of the device.

===Gas===
{{main article|Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker}}
Gas (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc using a [[magnetic field]], and then rely upon the dielectric strength of the SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas to quench the stretched arc.

===Hybrid===
{{main article|Hybrid switchgear modules}}
Hybrid switchgear is a type which combines the components of traditional air-insulated switchgear (AIS) and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) technologies. It is characterized by a compact and modular design, which encompasses several different functions in one module.

===Vacuum===
Circuit breakers with [[vacuum interrupter]]s have minimal arcing characteristics (as there is nothing to ionize other than the contact material), so the arc quenches when it is stretched by a small amount (&amp;lt;2–8&amp;nbsp;mm). Near zero current the arc is not hot enough to maintain a plasma, and current ceases; the gap can then withstand the rise of voltage. Vacuum circuit breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 40,500 volts. Unlike the other types, they are inherently unsuitable for interrupting DC faults. The reason vacuum circuit breakers are unsuitable for breaking high DC voltages is that with DC there is no "current zero" period. The plasma arc can feed itself by continuing to gasify the contact material.

===Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)===
Breakers that use [[carbon dioxide]] as the insulating and arc extinguishing medium work on the same principles as a [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) breaker. Because SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] more potent than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by switching from SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it is possible to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 10 tons during the product lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Switzerland : ABB breaks new ground with environment friendly high-voltage circuit breaker. |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Switzerland+%3A+ABB+breaks+new+ground+with+environment+friendly...-a0300987882|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective circuitry==

===Circuit breakers and fuses===
Circuit breakers and fuses disconnect when current exceeds a predetermined safe level.  However they cannot sense other critical faults, such as unbalanced currents—for example, when a transformer winding contacts ground.  By themselves, circuit breakers and fuses cannot distinguish between short circuits and high levels of electrical demand.

===Merz-Price circulating current scheme===
Differential protection depends upon [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)|Kirchhoff's current law]], which states that the sum of currents entering or leaving a circuit node must equal zero.  Using this principle to implement differential protection, any section of a conductive path may be considered a node.  The conductive path could be a transmission line, a winding of a transformer, a winding in a motor, or a winding in the stator of an alternator.  This form of protection works best when both ends of the conductive path are physically close to each other.  This scheme was invented  in Great Britain by [[Charles Hesterman Merz]] and [[Bernard Price]].&lt;ref name="Black1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Monro Black|title=The History of Electric Wires and Cables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUCieJjeQ-wC&amp;pg=PA101|date=January 1983|publisher=IET|isbn=978-0-86341-001-7|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two identical current transformers are used for each winding of a transformer, stator, or other device.  The current transformers are placed around opposite ends of a winding.  The current through both ends should be identical.  A protective relay detects any imbalance in currents, and trips circuit breakers to isolate the device.  In the case of a transformer, the circuit breakers on both the primary and secondary would open.

===Distance relays===
A short circuit at the end of a long transmission line appears similar to a normal load, because the impedance of the transmission line limits the fault current.  A distance relay detects a fault by comparing the voltage and current on the transmission line.  A large current along with a voltage drop indicates a fault.

==Classification==
Several different classifications of switchgear can be made:&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Smeaton (ed) ''Switchgear and Control Handbook 3rd Ed.'', McGraw Hill, New York 1997 {{ISBN|0-07-058451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}
A single line-up may incorporate several different types of devices, for example, air-insulated bus, vacuum circuit breakers, and manually operated switches may all exist in the same row of cubicles.

Ratings, design, specifications and details of switchgear are set by a multitude of standards. In North America mostly [[IEEE]] and [[ANSI]] standards are used, much of the rest of the world uses [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards, sometimes with local national derivatives or variations.

==Safety==
[[Image:Disjoncteurs 245kV.jpg|thumb|Disjoncteurs 245 kV dans un poste AIS|245&amp;nbsp;kV circuit breaker in air insulated substation]]
[[Image:GIS 420kV.jpg|thumb|Poste blindé (GIS) 420 kV| 420&amp;nbsp;kV gas insulated switchgear]]
To help ensure safe operation sequences of switchgear, [[trapped key interlocking]] provides predefined scenarios of operation. For example, if only one of two sources of supply are permitted to be connected at a given time, the interlock scheme may require that the first switch must be opened to release a key that will allow closing the second switch. Complex schemes are possible.

Indoor switchgear can also be type tested for internal arc containment (e.g., IEC 62271-200). This test is important for user safety as modern switchgear is capable of switching large currents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy.siemens.com/cms/00000013/aune/Documents/Medium%20Voltage%20Arc%20Fault%20Containment.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318070617/https://www.energy.siemens.com/cms/00000013/aune/Documents/Medium%20Voltage%20Arc%20Fault%20Containment.pdf |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switchgear is often inspected using [[thermal imaging]] to assess the state of the system and predict failures before they occur. Other methods include [[partial discharge]] (PD) testing, using either fixed or portable testers, and [[acoustic emission]] testing using surface-mounted transducers (for oil equipment) or [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic]] detectors used in outdoor switchyards. Temperature sensors fitted to cables to the switchgear can permanently monitor temperature build-up. SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; equipment is invariably fitted with alarms and interlocks to warn of loss of pressure, and to prevent operation if the pressure falls too low.

The increasing awareness of dangers associated with high fault levels has resulted in network operators specifying closed-door operations for earth switches and racking breakers. Many European power companies have banned operators from switch rooms while operating. [[Remote racking system]]s are available which allow an operator to rack switchgear from a remote location without the need to wear a protective arc flash hazard suit. Switchgear systems require continuous maintenance and servicing to remain safe to use and fully optimized to provide such high voltages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://johnsonphillips.co.uk/services/switchgear/|title=Switchgear Systems and Services|last=|first=|date=|website=johnsonphillips.co.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Trett''' (or '''tret''') was an allowance made up until the early 19th century, for waste, dust, and other impurity in items in commerce, generally amounting to 4 pounds in each 104 pounds (3.85%).  It fell into disuse because merchants preferred to  simply adjust the price, rather than make a calculation for trett.

==Usage==
Trett was most commonly used in calculating the true weight for imported commodities to Great Britain which would be sold by the pound [[avoirdupois]].  From the gross weight, [[tare weight]] would be deducted, to account for the weight of any container that the commodity was enclosed in.  The remainder was known as the ''suttle''.  Trett was deducted from the suttle at the rate of four pounds for every 104&amp;nbsp;pounds of commodity, to take account of any dust, sand, and other impurity included in the suttle.  The remainder, after trett was deducted, became known as the "neat weight" or "nett weight", a term used in common for commodities in which no trett was to be deducted, but from which tare had been deducted.&lt;ref name = "math"&gt;{{Citation

==In Ireland==
Trett varied considerably from the British usage, for goods in Ireland.  For most goods there, trett was deducted at the rate of 1 pound per 112 pounds (0.89%).  However, in Cork, trett was deducted after tare for wool at the rate of 8 pounds per 20 stone (2.86%), and in Dublin 8 pounds per 21 stone (2.72%).  Additionally in Dublin, trett was deducted at the rate of {{convert|2|lb}} per large cask of butter, {{convert|4|lb}} per raw hide, and {{convert|8|lb}} per beef carcasse.&lt;ref name = "math"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26192">{{short description|A cosmic ray particle with a kinetic energy greater than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; eV}}
In [[astroparticle physics]], an '''ultra-high-energy cosmic ray''' ('''UHECR''') is a [[cosmic ray]] particle with a [[kinetic energy]] greater than {{val|1|e=18}} [[electronvolt|eV]], far beyond both the [[rest mass]] and energies typical of other cosmic ray particles.

An '''extreme-energy cosmic ray''' ('''EECR''') is an UHECR with energy exceeding {{val|5|e=19|u=eV}}  (about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]), the so-called  [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] (GZK limit).  This limit should be the maximum energy of cosmic ray protons that have traveled long distances (about 160 million light years), since higher-energy protons would have lost energy over that distance due to scattering from photons in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). It follows that EECR could not be survivors from the [[early universe]], but are cosmologically "young", emitted somewhere in the [[Local Supercluster]] by some unknown physical process. If an EECR is not a proton, but a nucleus with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons, then the GZK limit applies to its nucleons, which carry only a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; of the total energy of the nucleus. For an iron nucleus, the corresponding limit would be {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}.

These particles are extremely rare; between 2004 and 2007, the initial runs of the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (PAO) detected 27 events with estimated arrival energies above {{val|5.7|e=19|u=eV}}, i.e., about one such event every four weeks in the 3000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area surveyed by the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;

The postulated (hypothetical) sources of EECR are known as '''Zevatrons''', named in analogy to [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]'s [[Bevatron]] and [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]], and therefore capable of accelerating particles to 1 ZeV (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; eV, zetta-electronvolt).  In 2004 there was a consideration of the possibility of [[galactic jet]]s acting as Zevatrons, due to diffusive acceleration of particles caused by shock waves inside the jets. In particular, models suggested that shock waves from the nearby [[Elliptical galaxy M87|M87]] [[galactic jet]] could accelerate an iron nucleus to ZeV ranges.&lt;ref&gt;

Cosmic ray particles with even higher energies have since been observed. Among them was the [[Oh-My-God particle]] observed by the University of Utah's Fly's Eye experiment on the evening of 15 October 1991 over [[Dugway Proving Ground]], Utah.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;in other words, an [[atomic nucleus]] with kinetic energy equal to that of a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] ({{convert|5|oz|g|0|disp=or|sp=us}}) traveling at about {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us}}.

The energy of this particle is some 40 million times that of the highest energy protons that have been produced in any terrestrial [[particle accelerator]]. However, only a small fraction of this energy would be available for an interaction with a proton or neutron on Earth, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the products of the interaction (see [[Collider#Explanation]]). The effective energy available for such a collision is the square root of double the product of the particle's energy and the mass energy of the proton, which for this particle gives {{val|7.5|e=14|u=eV}}, roughly 50 times the collision energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

Since the first observation, by the [[University of Utah]]'s [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], at least fifteen similar events have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These very high energy cosmic ray particles are very rare; the energy of most cosmic ray particles is between 10&amp;nbsp;MeV and 10&amp;nbsp;GeV.

===Pierre Auger Observatory===
{{Main|Pierre Auger Observatory}}
Pierre Auger Observatory is an international cosmic ray observatory designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles (with energies beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; eV). These high-energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per square kilometer per century, therefore, in order to record a large number of these events, the Auger Observatory has created a detection area of 3,000&amp;nbsp;km² (the size of [[Rhode Island]], USA) in [[Mendoza Province]], western [[Argentina]].
A larger cosmic-ray detector array is also planned for the northern hemisphere as part of the Pierre Auger complex.
The Pierre Auger Observatory, in addition to obtaining directional information from the cluster of water tanks used to observe the cosmic-ray-shower components, also has four telescopes trained on the night sky to observe [[fluorescence]] of the [[nitrogen]] molecules as the shower particles traverse the sky, giving further directional information on the original cosmic ray particle.

In September 2017, data from 12 years of observations from PAO supported an extragalactic source (e.g. outside of Earth's galaxy) for the origin of extremely high energy cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-09/uon-scc091517.php|title=Study confirms cosmic rays have extragalactic origins|website=EurekAlert!|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested explanations==

===Neutron stars===
One suggested source of UHECR particles is their origination from [[neutron star]]s.  In young neutron stars with spin periods of &lt;10ms, the [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces]] from the quasi-neutral fluid of superconducting protons and electrons existing in a neutron [[superfluid]] accelerate iron nuclei to UHECR velocities.  The magnetic field produced by the neutron superfluid in rapidly rotating stars creates a magnetic field of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; tesla, at which point the neutron star is classified as a [[magnetar]].  This magnetic field is the strongest in the observed universe and creates the relativistic MHD wind believed to accelerate iron nuclei remaining from the supernova to the necessary energy.

Another hypothesized source of UHECRs from neutron stars is during neutron star to [[strange star]] combustion.  This hypothesis relies on the assumption that [[strange matter]] is the [[ground state]] of matter which has no experimental or observational data to support it.  Due to the immense gravitational pressures from the neutron star, it is believed that small pockets of matter consisting of ''up'', ''down'', and ''strange'' quarks in equilibrium acting as a single hadron (as opposed to a number of [[Sigma baryon|{{SubatomicParticle|Sigma0}} baryons]]).  This will then combust the entire star to strange matter, at which point the neutron star becomes a strange star and its magnetic field breaks down, which occurs because the protons and neutrons in the quasi-neutral fluid have become [[strangelets]].  This magnetic field breakdown releases large amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMWs).  The LAEMWs accelerate light ion remnants from the supernova to UHECR energies.

Very high energy cosmic ray electrons might be explained by the [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]] in the magnetospheres of the [[Crab Nebula#Crab Pulsar|Crab]]-like [[Pulsar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130212/srep01262/full/srep01262.html Mahajan Swadesh, Machabeli George, Osmanov Zaza &amp; Chkheidze Nino. Nature Scientific Reports, Volume 3, id. 1262 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active galactic cores===
Interactions with [[blue shift|blue-shifted]] [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] limit the distance that these particles can travel before losing energy; this is known as the [[Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit]] or GZK limit.

The source of such high energy particles has been a mystery for many years. Recent results from the Pierre Auger Observatory show that ultra-high-energy cosmic ray arrival directions appear to be correlated with extragalactic supermassive black holes at the center of nearby galaxies called [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei (AGN)]].&lt;ref name="PAO2007"/&gt;
However, since the angular correlation scale used is fairly large (3.1 degrees) these results do not unambiguously identify the origins of such cosmic ray particles. The AGN could merely be closely associated with the actual sources, for example in galaxies or other astrophysical objects that are clumped with matter on large scales within 100 [[megaparsec|Mpc]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Some of the [[supermassive black hole]]s in AGN are known to be rotating, as in the [[Seyfert galaxy]] MCG 6-30-15&lt;ref&gt;

===Relation with dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
It is hypothesized that active galactic nuclei are capable of converting dark matter into high energy protons. Yuri Pavlov and Andrey Grib at the Alexander Friedmann Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at St. Petersburg hypothesize that dark matter particles are about 15 times heavier than protons, and that they can decay into pairs of heavier virtual particles of a type that interacts with ordinary matter.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the [[Penrose process]]. Some of those particles will collide with incoming particles; these are very high energy collisions which, according to Pavlov, can form ordinary visible protons with very high energy. Pavlov then claims that evidence of such processes are ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such very energetic decay products, carrying a fraction of the mass of the X particle, are believed to be a plausible explanation for the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR).
 
High energy cosmic ray particles traversing intergalactic space suffer the [[GZK cutoff]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; eV due to interactions with cosmic background radiation if the primary cosmic ray particles are protons or nuclei. The [[Pierre Auger Observatory|Pierre Auger Project]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|HiRes]] and [[Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower Array]] found the GZK cutoff, while Akeno-[[AGASA]] observed the events above the cutoff (11 events in the past 10 years). The result of the Akeno-AGASA experiment is smooth near the GZK cutoff energy. If one assumes that the Akeno-AGASA result is correct and consider its implication, a possible explanation for the AGASA data on GZK cutoff violation would be a shower caused by dark matter particles. A dark matter particle is not constrained by the GZK cutoff, since it interacts weakly with cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements by the Pierre Auger Project have found a correlation between the direction of high energy cosmic ray particles and the location of AGN.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13951">A '''waste heat recovery unit (WHRU)''' is an [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] that transfers heat from process outputs at high temperature to another part of the process for some purpose, usually increased efficiency. The WHRU is a tool involved in [[cogeneration]]. Waste heat may be extracted from sources such as hot [[flue gas]]es from a diesel generator, steam from [[cooling towers]], or even [[waste water]] from cooling processes such as in [[quenching|steel cooling]].

[[File:Regenerative thermal oxidizer.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Regenerative thermal oxidizer]] (RTO) is an example of a waste heat recovery unit that utilizes a regenerative process.]]

==Principle==

===Heat recovery units===
Waste heat found in the [[exhaust gas]] of various processes or even from the exhaust stream of a [[Air conditioner|conditioning unit]] can be used to preheat the incoming gas. This is one of the basic methods for recovery of waste heat. Many [[Steel mill|steel making plants]] use this process as an economic method to increase the production of the plant with lower fuel demand.&lt;br/&gt;
There are many different commercial recovery units for the transferring of energy from hot medium space to lower one:&lt;ref&gt;Heat Recovery Systems, D.A.Reay, E &amp; F.N.Span, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Recuperator]]s: This name is given to different types of [[heat exchanger]] that the exhaust gases are passed through, consisting of metal tubes that carry the inlet gas and thus preheating the gas before entering the process. The [[Thermal wheel|heat wheel]] is an example which operates on the same principle as a [[solar air conditioning#Solar A/C using desiccants|solar air conditioning]] unit.
#[[Regenerative heat exchanger|Regenerators]]: This is an industrial unit that reuses the same stream after processing. In this type of heat recovery, the heat is regenerated and reused in the process.
#[[Heat pipe|Heat pipe exchanger]]: Heat pipes are one of the best thermal conductors. They have the ability to transfer heat hundred times more than copper. Heat pipes are mainly known in renewable energy technology as being used in [[evacuated tube collector]]s. The heat pipe is mainly used in space, process or air heating, in waste heat from a process is being transferred to the surrounding due to its [[Heat pipe|transfer mechanism]].
#[[Thermal Wheel]] or rotary heat exchanger: consists of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system.
#[[Economizer]]: In case of process boilers, waste heat in the exhaust gas is passed along a recuperator that carries the inlet fluid for the boiler and thus decreases thermal energy intake of the inlet fluid.
#[[Heat pumps]]: Using an organic fluid that boils at a low temperature means that energy could be regenerated from waste fluids.
#[[Run around coil]]: comprises two or more multi-row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit.
Particulate Filters (DPF) to capture emission by maintaining higher temperatures adjacent to the converter and tail pipes to reduce the amount of emissions from the exhaust.

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

===Heat to power units===
According to a report done by [[Energetics Incorporated]] for the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in November 2004 titled ''Technology Roadmap''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/intensiveprocesses/pdfs/reduction_roadmap.pdf|title=Technology Roadmap Energy Loss Reduction and Recovery |date=November 2004|author= Energetics Incorporated|publisher= U.S. Department of Energy, [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]]|format=pdf|accessdate=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several others done by the [[European commission]], the majority of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/dtet/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Waste heat of different degrees could be found in final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the [[slag]] in [[steelmaking]] plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units. For example, an [[Organic Rankine cycle]] unit uses an organic fluid as the [[working fluid]]. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a [[superheated]] gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. [[Thermoelectric]] ([[Seebeck effect|Seebeck]], [[Peltier effect|Peltier]], [[Thomson effect|Thomson]] effects) units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power.

[[Shape-memory alloy|Shape-memory alloys]] can also be used to recover low temperature waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exergyn.com&lt;/ref&gt;. 

 
A WHRB is different from a Heat Recovery Steam Generator ([[HRSG]]) in the sense that the heated medium does not change phase.

==Applications==

* Traditionally, waste heat of low temperature range (0-120&amp;nbsp;°C, or typically under 100&amp;nbsp;°C) has not been used for electricity generation despite efforts by ORC companies,{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}} mainly because the Carnot efficiency is rather low (max. 18% for 90&amp;nbsp;°C heating and 20&amp;nbsp;°C cooling, minus losses, typically ending up with 5-7% net electricity). 
* Waste Heat of medium (120-650&amp;nbsp;°C) and high (&gt;650&amp;nbsp;°C) temperature could be used for the generation of electricity or mechanical work via different capturing processes.
* Waste heat recovery system can also be used to fulfill refrigeration requirements of a trailer (for example). The configuration is easy as only a waste heat recovery boiler and absorption cooler is required. Furthermore only low pressures and temperatures needed to be handled.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Advantages:

These systems have many benefits which could be direct or indirect.

* Direct benefits: The recovery process will add to the efficiency of the process and thus decrease the costs of fuel and energy consumption needed for that process.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401102235.htm Tapping Industrial Waste Heat Could Reduce Fossil Fuel Demands&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indirect benefits:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.em-ea.org&lt;/ref&gt;
#Reduction in [[Pollution]]: [[Thermal pollution|Thermal]] and [[air pollution|air]] pollution will dramatically decrease since less [[flue gases]] of high temperature are emitted from the plant since most of the energy is recycled.
#Reduction in the equipment sizes: As Fuel consumption reduces so the control and security equipment for handling the fuel decreases. Also, filtering equipment for the gas is no longer needed in large sizes.
#Reduction in auxiliary energy consumption: Reduction in equipment sizes means another reduction in the energy fed to those systems like pumps, filters, fans,...etc.

Disadvantages:

*Capital cost: The capital cost to implement a waste heat recovery system may outweigh the benefit gained in heat recovered. It is necessary to put a cost to the heat being offset.
*Quality of heat: Often waste heat is of low quality (temperature). It can be difficult to efficiently utilize the quantity of low quality heat contained in a waste heat medium. Heat exchangers tend to be larger to recover significant quantities which increases capital cost.
*Maintenance of Equipment: Additional equipment requires additional maintenance cost.
*Units add addition size and mass to overall power unit. Especially a consideration on power units which are on vehicles.

==Example==
The [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine|Cyclone]] waste heat engine is designed to generate electricity from recovered waste heat energy using a steam cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html Cyclone Power Technologies Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Wastewater Heat Exchange Systems|International Wastewater Systems]] is another company addressing waste heat recovery systems. Focused on  multi-unit residential, publicly shared buildings, industrial applications and district energy systems, their systems use the energy in [[waste water]] for domestic hot water production, building space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/12/121211-sewage-heat-recovery/|title=Waste Wattage: Cities Aim to Flush Heat Energy Out of Sewers|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motorsport series [[Formula One]] introduced waste heat recovery units in 2014 under the name MGU-H. The MGU-H will be abandoned for the 2021 due to development costs.
