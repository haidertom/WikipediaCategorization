|quote= New Anarchism is a term that Andrej Grubacic uses to describe the most recent reinvention of the anarchist thought and practice. What distinguishes the new anarchism of today from the new anarchism of the '60s and '70s, or from the work of US-UK based authors like Murray Bookchin, Paul Goodman, Herbert Read, Colin Ward and Alex Comfort, is its pronounced global perspective. Some of the useful essays on new anarchism include David Graeber's "New Anarchists" in ''A Movement of Movements: is Another World Really possible?'', ed. Tom Mertes (London: Verso, 2004); Andrej Grubacic, "Towards Another Anarchism" in ''World Social Forum: Challenging Empires, ed. Jai Sen and Peter Waterman (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2007). A good introductory essay by David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic, "Anarchism or the Revolutionary Movement of the 21st Century," is available on line at http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/9258. see also Leonard Williams, "The New Anarchists," paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia, PA, August 31, 2006, online, pdf, 2008-05-07 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p152623_index.html.

He moved to Binghamton University where he participated in research working groups at the [[Fernand Braudel Center]] on anarchist implications of [[world-systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readysteadybook.com/Article.aspx?page=davidgraeber&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 he moved to San Francisco and worked in the sociology department at the University of San Francisco and urban studies department at the San Francisco Art Institute. He is now a Professor and Department Chair of Anthropology and Social Change Anthropology at the California Institute of Integral Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Graduate_Programs/Anthropology_and_Social_Change.html&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in world systems analysis and anarchist anthropology has influenced his research perspective, which includes experiences of self-organization, voluntary association, and mutual aid on the world-scale. His ongoing research on exilic spaces in the modern capitalist world system considers how spatial expressions of concentrated mutual aid are produced and reproduced on the outside/inside of capitalist civilization. Exilic spaces and practices refer to liminal and non-state areas relatively autonomous from capitalist valorization and state control.  His principal research focus is on the autonomous "cracks" peopled by Don Cossacks, Atlantic pirates, Macedonian Roma, Jamaican Maroons and Mexican Zapatistas. This research is included in his UC Press book ''[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520287303 Living at the Edges of Capitalism]''. Co-authored with Denis O'Hearn, the book is a winner of the 2017 American Sociological Association PEWS prize for Distinguished Scholarship. His other research interests include the history of the Balkans, militant research, and activist ethnography &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Graduate_Programs/Anthropology_and_Social_Change/Anthropology_and_Social_Change_Faculty/Andrej_Grubacic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In 2006, Grubacic teamed up with activist and historian [[Staughton Lynd]] to write the book ''[https://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=56 Wobblies and Zapatistas]''

He went on to edit ''The Staughton Lynd Reader'', and offer a new programmatic proposal for the "libertarian socialism for the 21st century," inspired by Lynd's work.

His most recent academic book is ''Living at the Edges of Capitalism'', co-authored with Denis O'Hearn and winner of the 2017 American Sociological Association Political Economy of the World-System (PEWS) Book Award.

His other works include books in Balkan languages, chapters and numerous articles related to the history and utopian present of the Balkans, anarchism, and radical sociology. Grubačić worked with David Graeber to develop an anarchist version of world-systems analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antropologi.info/blog/anthropology/2007/get_out_of_the_library_and_into_the_stre&lt;/ref&gt;

Grubacic is a Professor and Department Chair at CIIS [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. Grubačić also works as a guest host of the [[KPFA]] radio program [[Against the Grain (radio program)|''Against the Grain'']].

===Reviews of ''Wobblies and Zapatistas''===

{{quote|
''Wobblies and Zapatistas'' recounts a radical history and connects activist political movements and generations.

Global capitalism has suffered a major blow in the past year, the largest economic turmoil since the 1930s fuelling political discussions on possible alternatives to the current economic model. For those seeking alternatives to mainstream historical narratives, ''Wobblies and Zapatistas: Conversations on Anarchism, Marxism and Radical History'' is an important read. Spanning from the [[Cold War]] to the 1990s expansion of market-driven free-trade policies, this engaging book offers critical historical reflections on events that have shaped contemporary politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hour.ca/books/books.aspx?iIDArticle=18578
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[World Social Forum]], in its near decade of existence, has popularized the slogan "Another World Is Possible." Although many on the left may agree, and there is broad agreement about the nature of the world we live in and the shape of the one we wish to create, there is less agreement on how to create that new world. ''Wobblies and Zapatistas'', a conversation of sorts between longtime anarchist activist Grubacic and [[Staughton Lynd]], who for the last 40 years has been one of the iconic figures of the U.S. left, is a contribution to resolving that argument—or at least turning it into a productive discussion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmpress.org/content/article.php?story=WobsNACLA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;More theoretical and frankly meandering is ''Wobblies and Zapatistas,''...&amp;nbsp;The conversation starts out with the Chiapas rebellion and the Industrial Workers of the World—"the Zapatistas of yesteryear," in Lynd’s phrase—but makes brief stops with the community organizing efforts of former steelworkers in post-industrial Youngstown, the [[1946 general strike in Oakland]], the Vietnam-era [[antiwar movement]], and the 1980s [[revolutionary upsurges of Central America]]. Lynd ties it all together with his concept of "accompaniment"—basically, throwing one’s lot in with oppressed, sharing the burdens and risks of their struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warresisters.org/node/884 "Mexico Unconquered and Wobblies and Zapatistas", ''War Resisters League'', Bill Weinberg, 2009-11-02]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This volume brings together two radical intellectuals from alternative political traditions for an extended conversation about theory, activism, and the state of radical politics today. Throughout their conversation, Staughton Lynd, the civil rights organizer, antiwar activist, lawyer, and radical historian, responds to the probing questions of Andrej Grubacic, the radical sociologist and activist from the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isreview.org/issues/67/rev-wobblies.shtml "Debating how to change the world", ''International Socialist Review'', Issue 67, September–October 2009, ERIC KERL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reviews of ''Don't Mourn, Balkanize!''===
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a splendid time for the North American reader to meet the extraordinary Andrej Grubacic. After something of a letdown following the Seattle 1999 events– including what many of us perceived as an ideology-driven sectarian turn–anarchists are back in the news with the Occupations. No, not the anarchism of Bakunin or even Bookchin, but anarchism in a new key as well as a new generation, more practical and more open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/11/25/dont-mourn-balkanize/ "Andrej Grubacic on Yugoslavia", Paul Buhle 2011-11-25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When this writer worked in Kosovo, attempts to interview people from the small community of Serbs that remained there after the European Union took over the city almost invariably failed...Mr. Grubačić also proposes what he calls a "balkanization from below, a pluricultural concept in which, however, rejects that of the European Union." In this idea, Balkan people need to "find the strength and orientation for a new politics for another Balkans. It should be a politics of a Balkan Federation. A participatory society, built from the bottom up, through struggles for the creation of an inclusive democratic awareness, participatory social experiments, and an emancipatory practice that would win the political imagination of all people in the region." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/don%E2%80%99t-mourn-balkanize-essays-after-yugoslavia/ "Don’t Mourn, Balkanize!: Essays after Yugoslavia", Andrew Rosenbaum 2011-11-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Andrej Grubačić is probably the most radical writer to approach the Balkans. He does so from an anarchist perspective, and his ideas are informed by both his background and his politics.  Although he is from Belgrade, which is now the capital of Serbia, he continues to think of himself as Yugoslav, despite the fact that Yugoslavia no longer exists as a country. This paradox of identity illustrates the difficulties that the changing political landscape of the Balkans have caused for people from the region.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't Mourn, Balkanize! is divided into two main sections—on balkanization from above and balkanization from below—both chronologically organized and both revolving around the same themes: the politics of exclusion, intervention, and resistance, within and beyond the Balkans, but especially in Serbia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/ "After Yugoslavia: Alternative Balkanization from Below", Irina Ceric 2011-04-19 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''Arrested decay'''" is a term coined by the State of [[California]], [[United States]] to explain how it would preserve its [[Bodie, California|Bodie State Historic Park]].  A more common application of this concept is the preservation of war ruins as memorials.

[[Image:EasternStatePenitentiary.JPG|thumb|right|[[Eastern State Penitentiary]], May, 2006]]
[[Image:Vukovar water tank.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Vukovar water tower|The water tower in Vukovar]], 2005. Heavily damaged in the battle, it has been preserved as a symbol of the town's suffering.]]

[[Image:Car in Oradour-sur-Glane.JPG|thumb|200px|A view of the old village of Oradour-sur-Glane]]

== United States ==
At [[Bodie, California|Bodie State Historic Park]], the structures will be maintained, but only to the extent that they will not be allowed to fall over or otherwise deteriorate in a major way.

Any building that was standing in 1962, when Bodie became a State Park, may be rebuilt or preserved as the photographs of 1962 showed them. By putting new roofs on the buildings, rebuilding foundations, and resealing glass that is in window frames, the State is able to keep buildings from naturally decaying.

[[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] uses a similar system, though it uses the term "'''preserved ruin'''."

== Croatia ==
The authorities in [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]] decided to keep the [[Vukovar water tower|old water tower in the city]] as it is found today and as it had become after the war &amp;mdash; gnarled by [[artillery]].

== Berlin, Germany ==
Several buildings destroyed in the [[World War II|Second World War]] have been preserved in their ruined condition as memorials.  These include part of the facade of the [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof|Anhalter Bahnhof]] and the belfry of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]].

== Sarajevo, Bosnia ==
The authorities in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] have also preserved the building of the daily newspaper [[Oslobođenje]] to this day the way it was shelled during the [[Bosnian War]].

== Hiroshima, Japan ==
In 1996,  the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]]  was acknowledged as a [[World Heritage Site|Unesco World Heritage Site]]. Originally completed in 1905, the building was known at the time of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion]] on August 6, 1945  as the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall''. Although suffering considerable damage, it was the closest structure to the [[hypocenter]] of the explosion to withstand the blast without being leveled to the ground. It has been preserved in the condition it was in after the bombing to serve as a symbol of hope for [[world peace]] and [[nuclear disarmament]].

== Oradour-sur-Glane, France ==
[[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was a village in the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] [[Regions of France|région]] of [[France]] that was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants &amp;ndash; men, women and children &amp;ndash; were murdered by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Waffen-SS]] company. Although a new village was built after World War II, away from the ruins of the former village, the old village &amp;ndash; the site of the massacre &amp;ndash; still stands as a memorial to the dead and as being representative of similar sites and events. Part of the memorial includes items recovered from the burned out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive; glasses &amp;ndash; melted from the intense heat; and various personal items and money.

==Information==
Beef rings were common among [[North America]]n farmers who had no means for [[refrigeration]] of meat until the beginning of the 20th century. Although pigs were small enough that a smoked [[pork]] carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of [[cattle]], and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan&gt;{{cite book|title=Kill and Chill|author=Ian MacLachlan|pages=124|publisher=University of Toronto Press|date=2002|isbn13=9780802078322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a [[steak]], a [[roast beef|roast]], and a boiling [[joint]] each week.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan/&gt; By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmers "making Good"|author=Lyle Dick|pages=170|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=2008|isbn13=9781552382417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beef rings died out for several reasons, including technological advances in refrigeration, greater economic prosperity for farmers, greater independence, and the ability of farmers to buy meat at butchers' shops rather than slaughter and store it themselves.&lt;ref name=Dick/&gt;

{{History of France}}

The '''''Belle Époque''''' or '''''La Belle Époque''''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛlepɔk|lang}}; [[French language|French]] for "Beautiful Era") was a period of [[Western history]]. It is conventionally dated from the end of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871 to the outbreak of [[World War I|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelsmyth.com/belle_epoque.html|title=|publisher=La Belle Époque|language=English|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring during the era of the [[French Third Republic]] (beginning 1870), it was a period characterized by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity, an apex of [[colonial empire]]s and [[Second Industrial Revolution|technological]], scientific, and cultural innovations. In the climate of the period, especially in [[Paris]], the arts flourished. Many masterpieces of literature, music, theater, and visual art gained recognition. The ''Belle Époque'' was named in retrospect, when it began to be considered a "[[Golden Age]]" in contrast to the horrors of World War I.

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the ''Belle Époque'' overlapped with the late [[Victorian era]] and the [[Edwardian era]] in a period known as [[Pax Britannica]]. In [[German Empire|Germany]], the ''Belle Époque'' coincided with the reigns of [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] and the [[Wilhelminism]] of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. In [[Italy]], with the reigns of [[Victor Emmanuel II]], [[Umberto I]] and early of the reign of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]]. In [[Russia]], with the reigns of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. In the [[United States]], emerging from the [[Panic of 1873]], the comparable period was the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref&gt; The American term "Gilded Age" was coined by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Charles Dudley Warner]] in their book, ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today]]'' (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]], it started with the end of the [[Paraguayan War]]. In [[Mexico]], the period was known as the [[History of Mexico#Porfiriato (1876–1910)|Porfiriato]], and in [[Japan]], it coincided with the [[Meiji period]].

The French public's [[nostalgia]] for the ''Belle Époque'' period was based largely on the peace and prosperity connected with it in retrospect. Two devastating world wars and their aftermath made the ''Belle Époque'' appear to be a time of ''[[joie de vivre]]'' (joy of living) in contrast to 20th century hardships. It was also a period of stability that France enjoyed after the tumult of the early years of the [[French Third Republic]], beginning with France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Paris Commune]], and the fall of General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]]. The defeat of Boulanger, and the celebrations tied to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 World's Fair]] in Paris, launched an era of optimism and affluence. [[French imperialism]] was in its prime. It was a cultural center of global influence, and its educational, scientific and medical institutions were at the leading edge of Europe.

It was not entirely the reality of life in Paris or in France, however.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} France had a large economic underclass who never experienced much of the ''Belle Époque''{{'}}s wonders and entertainments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Poverty remained endemic in Paris's urban slums and rural peasantry for decades after the ''Belle Époque'' ended.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Conflicts between the government and the Roman Catholic Church were regular during the period. Some of the artistic elite saw the [[Fin de siècle]] in a pessimistic light.

[[File:Grand-foyer.jpg|thumb|Grand [[foyer]] of the [[Folies Bergère]] [[cabaret]]]]
Those who were able to benefit from the prosperity of the era were drawn towards new forms of light entertainment during the ''Belle Époque'', and the Parisian bourgeoisie, or the successful industrialists called ''[[nouveau-riche]]s'', became increasingly influenced by the habits and fads of the city's elite social class, known popularly as ''[[Tout-Paris]]'' ("all of Paris", or "everyone in Paris"). The [[Casino de Paris]] opened in 1890. For Paris's less affluent public, entertainment was provided by [[cabaret]]s, [[bistro]]s and [[music hall]]s.

The [[Moulin Rouge]] cabaret is a Paris landmark still open for business today. The [[Folies Bergère]] was another landmark venue. [[Burlesque]] performance styles were more mainstream in ''Belle Époque'' Paris than in more staid cities of Europe and America. [[Liane de Pougy]], dancer, [[socialite]] and [[courtesan]], was well known in Paris as a headline performer at top cabarets. ''Belle Époque'' dancers such as [[La Goulue]] and [[Jane Avril]] were Paris celebrities, who modelled for [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s iconic poster art. The [[Can-can]] dance was a popular 19th-century cabaret style that appears in Toulouse-Lautrec's posters from the era.

The [[Eiffel Tower]], built to serve as the grand entrance to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 World's Fair]] held in Paris, became the accustomed symbol of the city, to its inhabitants and to visitors from around the world. Paris hosted another successful World's Fair in 1900, the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]. Paris had been profoundly changed by the [[French Second Empire]] reforms to the city's architecture and public amenities. [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]] changed its housing, street layouts, and green spaces. The walkable neighbourhoods were well-established by the ''Belle Époque''.

[[File:LeFrou Frou1900Page128.gif|thumb|A 1900 cartoon from magazine ''Le Frou Frou'' (signed "Jan Duch") satirizing a style trend favoring small breasts (a large bosom may still be acceptable in the provinces, but not in Paris!). A "boyish figure" didn't actually become a mainstream fashion ideal until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''Le Frou Frou'' 1900 Page 128&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cheap coal and cheap labor contributed to the cult of the [[orchid]]&lt;ref&gt;"Incontestably the favorite flowers of the ''Belle Époque'' were orchids and [[Calla|calla lilies]]," (Gabriele Fahr-Becker, ''Art Nouveau'' 2007, p. 112; the fashion for orchids is narrated in Eric Hansen, ''Orchid Fever: A Horticultural Tale of Love, Lust, and Lunacy'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and made possible the perfection of fruits [[greenhouse|grown under glass]], as the apparatus of [[state dinner]]s extended to the upper classes. Exotic feathers and furs were more prominently featured in fashion than ever before, as ''[[haute couture]]'' was invented in Paris, the center of the Belle Époque, where fashion began to move in a yearly cycle. In Paris, [[restaurant]]s such as [[Maxim's Paris]] achieved a new splendor and cachet as places for the rich to parade. Maxim's Paris was arguably the city's most exclusive restaurant. [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyles gained a different glamour, pursued in the [[cabaret]]s of [[Montmartre]].

Fashion in the Belle Epoque era was the peak of luxury living for a select few. Not only did this era bring in new trends to fashion, they also kept trends from the Edwardian trends. The Belle Epoque was very different from the Edwardian era even though they used the styles because the garments were not influenced by the English King or the Prince of Wales. They wanted nothing to do with the era. Clothes were specifically designed and marketed for those extremely wealthy and those who were privileged. These garments covered most garments from daily wear to formal gowns. It is hard to distinguish between the two because of how similar they evolved. La Belle Epoque heavily influenced by custom designs and tailor-made garments. At this time clothing began to change for women becoming functional. After the Prussian war the fullest part of a women’s skirts, started to move to the back with draped overskirts that were supported by bustles. The necklines were still high with narrow sleeves with the tendency to flare slightly at the wrist. Evening gowns start to become a little more risky with low necklines and off the shoulder sleeves. This was for women to show off their jewelry that symbolized their class status. Towards the end of the 1870s the corset started to appear in women’s wear. As women start to turn away from the bustle, it again comes back to creating the S-shape making it fuller all the way around. This also eliminated the long trains that were typical for a women’s dress. This S-shape figure all women were going for was also known as the hobble-skirts. As the years go on, the bustle disappears from women’s wardrobes constructing a slimming tight fitting dress for women. This look elongated women’s body, along with making this a more functional look. Though they didn’t have a bustle, the women now had dresses and blouses that were pulled and puffed in the front, resulting in what was called a “Pigeon Breast” at the time. Mens fashion at this time didn’t change much compared to women’s fashion. Some changes in Mens fashion like frock coats and three piece suits but nothing to extreme.


French cuisine continued to climb in the esteem of European [[gourmet]]s during the ''Belle Époque''. The word "ritzy" was invented during this era, referring to the posh atmosphere and clientele of the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Allen S.|title=Feast and Folly: Cuisine, Intoxication, and the Poetics of the Sublime|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791455180|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head chef and co-owner of the Ritz, [[Auguste Escoffier]], was the pre-eminent French chef during the ''Belle Époque''. Escoffier modernized French [[haute cuisine]], also doing much work to spread its reputation abroad with business projects in London in addition to Paris. [[champagne (wine)|Champagne]] was perfected during the ''Belle Époque''. The alcoholic spirit [[absinthe]] was cited by many Art Nouveau artists as a muse and inspiration and can be seen in much of the artwork of the time.

Large public buildings such as the [[Opéra Garnier]] devoted enormous spaces to interior designs as Art Nouveau show places. After the mid-19th century, [[Rail transport|railways]] linked all the major cities of Europe to [[spa]] towns like [[Biarritz]], [[Deauville]], [[Vichy]], [[Arcachon]] and the [[French Riviera]]. Their carriages were rigorously divided into first-class and second-class, but the [[ultra high-net-worth individual|super-rich]] now began to commission [[private railroad car|private railway coaches]], as exclusivity as well as display was a hallmark of opulent luxury.

==Politics==
[[File:Europe 1911.jpg|thumb|Europe during the ''Belle Époque'']]
The years between the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and World War I were characterized by unusual political stability in [[Western Europe|western]] and [[central Europe]]. Although [[French–German enmity|tensions between the French and German governments]] persisted as a result of the French loss of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to Germany in 1871, diplomatic conferences, including the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Congo Conference]] in 1884, and the [[Algeciras Conference]] in 1906, mediated disputes that threatened the general European peace. Indeed, for many Europeans in the ''Belle Époque'' period, transnational, class-based affiliations were as important as national identities, particularly among aristocrats.  An upper-class gentleman could travel through much of Western Europe without a [[passport]] and even reside abroad with minimal bureaucratic regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History 1914–1945'', and ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918''&lt;/ref&gt; World War I, mass transportation, the spread of literacy, and various citizenship concerns changed this.

The ''Belle Époque'' featured a [[class structure]] that ensured cheap labor. The [[Paris Metro]] underground railway system joined the [[Bus|omnibus]] and [[streetcar]] in transporting the working population, including those [[servant]]s who did not live in the wealthy centers of cities. One result of this [[commuting]] was [[suburbanization]] allowing [[Working class|working-class]] and upper-class neighborhoods to be [[income segregation|separated]] by large distances.

Meanwhile, the international workers' movement also reorganized itself and reinforced pan-European, class-based identities among the classes whose labor supported the Belle Époque. The most notable transnational [[Socialism|socialist]] organization was the [[Second International]]. [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] of different affiliations [[Propaganda of the deed|were active]] during the period leading up to World War I. Political assassinations and assassination attempts were still rare in France (unlike in Russia) but there were some notable exceptions, including President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]] in 1894. A bomb was detonated in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France]] in 1893, causing injuries but no deaths. Terrorism against civilians occurred in 1894, perpetrated by [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], who killed a cafe patron and wounded several others.

[[File:J'accuse - Gallica - page 1.jpg|thumb|A newspaper headline for [[Émile Zola]]'s open letter to the French government and the country, condemning the treatment of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] during the [[Dreyfus Affair]]]]
France enjoyed relative political stability at home during the Belle Époque. The sudden death of President [[Félix Faure]] while in office took the country by surprise, but had no destabilizing effect on the government. The most serious political issue to face the country during this period was the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] was wrongly convicted of treason, with fabricated evidence from French government officials. [[Anti-Semitism]] directed at Dreyfus, and tolerated by the general French public in everyday society, was a central issue in the controversy and the court trials that followed. Public debate surrounding the Dreyfus Affair grew to an uproar after the publication of [[J'accuse (letter)|J'accuse]], a letter sent to newspapers by prominent novelist [[Émile Zola]], condemning government corruption and French anti-Semitism. The Dreyfus Affair consumed the interest of the French for several years and it received heavy newspaper coverage.

European politics saw very few regime changes, the major exception being [[Portugal]], which experienced a [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910. However, tensions between working-class socialist parties, [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties, and landed or aristocratic [[Conservatism|conservative]] parties did increase in many countries, and it has been claimed that profound political instability belied the calm surface of European politics in the era.&lt;ref&gt;Arno J. Mayer, ''The Persistence of the Old Regime: Europe to the Great War''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[militarism]] and international tensions grew considerably between 1897 and 1914, and the immediate prewar years were marked by a general [[Arms race|armaments competition]] in Europe. Additionally, this era was one of massive overseas [[colonialism]], known as the [[New Imperialism]]. The most famous portion of this imperial expansion was the [[Scramble for Africa]].

==Science and technology==

The ''Belle Époque'' was an era of great scientific and technological advancement in Europe and the world in general. Inventions of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] that became generally common in this era include the perfection of lightly sprung, noiseless [[carriage]]s in a multitude of new fashionable forms, which were superseded towards the end of the era by the [[automobile]], which was for its first decade a luxurious experiment for the well-heeled.&lt;ref&gt;The first [[Ford Model T]], a car for the masses, rolled off the [[assembly line]] in 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; French automobile manufacturers such as [[Peugeot]] were already pioneers in automobile manufacturing. [[Édouard Michelin (born 1859)|Edouard Michelin]] invented removable [[pneumatic]] [[tires]] for bicycles and automobiles in the 1890s. The [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] and [[moped]] are also ''Belle Époque'' inventions.

A number of French inventors patented products with a lasting impact on modern society. After the [[telephone]] joined the [[telegraph]] as a vehicle for rapid communication, French inventor [[Édouard Belin]] developed the Belinograph, or [[Wirephoto]], to transmit photos by telephone. The [[electric light]] began to supersede [[gas lighting]], and [[neon light]]s were invented in France.

France was a leader of early cinema technology. The [[cinématographe]] was invented in France by [[Léon Bouly]] and put to use by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], brothers who held the first film screenings in the world. The Lumière brothers made many other innovations in [[cinematography]]. It was during this era that the [[Film|motion pictures]] were developed, though these did not become common until after World War I.

Although the [[aeroplane]] remained a fascinating experiment, France was a leader in aviation. France established the world's first national [[air force]] in 1910. Two French inventors, [[Louis Breguet]] and [[Paul Cornu]], made independent experiments with the first flying helicopters in 1907.

[[Henri Becquerel]] discovered [[radioactivity]] in 1896 while working with [[phosphorescent]] materials. His work confirmed and explained earlier observations regarding [[uranium]] salts by [[Abel Niépce de Saint-Victor]] in 1857.

It was during this era that biologists and physicians finally came to understand the [[germ theory of disease]], and the field of [[bacteriology]] was established. [[Louis Pasteur]] was perhaps the most famous scientist in France during this time. Pasteur developed [[pasteurisation]] and a [[rabies vaccine]]. Mathematician and physicist [[Henri Poincaré]] made important contributions to pure and applied mathematics, and also published books for the general public on mathematical and scientific subjects. [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] worked in France, winning the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, and the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. Physicist [[Gabriel Lippmann]] invented [[integral imaging]], still in use today.

==Art and literature==
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Auguste Renoir]], ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', 1876, oil on canvas, 131 × 175 cm, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]

In 1890, [[Vincent van Gogh]] died. It was during the 1890s that his paintings achieved the admiration that had eluded them during Van Gogh's life, first among other artists, then gradually among the public. Reactions against the ideals of the Impressionists characterized visual arts in Paris during the ''Belle Époque''. Among the [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] movements in Paris were the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]], the [[Salon de la Rose + Croix]], the [[Symbolist movement]] (also in poetry, music, and visual art), [[Fauvism]], and early [[Modernism]]. Between 1900 and 1914, [[Expressionism]] took hold of many artists in Paris and Vienna. Early works of [[Cubism]] and [[Abstraction]] were exhibited. Foreign influences were being strongly felt in Paris as well. The official art school in Paris, the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]], held an exhibition of Japanese printmaking that changed approaches to graphic design, particular posters and book illustration ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] was influenced by a similar exhibit when he visited Paris during the 1890s). Exhibits of African tribal art also captured the imagination of Parisian artists at the turn of the 20th century.

[[Art Nouveau]] is the most popularly recognized art movement to emerge from the period. This largely decorative style ([[Jugendstil]] in central Europe), characterized by its curvilinear forms, and nature inspired motifs became prominent from the mid-1890s and dominated progressive design throughout much of Europe. Its use in public art in Paris, such as [[Hector Guimard]]'s [[Paris Métro]] stations, has made it synonymous with the city.

Prominent artists in Paris during the ''Belle Époque'' included post-Impressionists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (whose reputation improved substantially after his death), [[Giuseppe Amisani]] and a young [[Pablo Picasso]]. More modern forms in sculpture also began to dominate as in the works of Paris-native Auguste Rodin.

Although [[Impressionism]] in painting began well before the ''Belle Époque'', it had initially been met with skepticism if not outright scorn by a public accustomed to the realist and representational art approved by the Academy. In 1890, Monet started his series ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''. Impressionism, which had been considered the artistic avant-garde in the 1860s, did not gain widespread acceptance until after World War I. The academic painting style, associated with the Academy of Art in Paris, remained the most respected style among the public in Paris.  Artists who appealed to the ''Belle Époque'' public include [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]]'s [[John William Waterhouse]], and [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]] and his depictions of idyllic Roman scenes. More progressive tastes patronized the [[Barbizon school]] ''[[plein-air]]'' painters. These painters were associates of the Pre-Raphaelites, who inspired a generation of esthetic-minded "[[The Souls|Souls]]".

Many successful examples of Art Nouveau, with notable regional variations, were built in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Austria (the [[Vienna Secession]]), Hungary, Bohemia and Latvia. It soon spread around the world, including to Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and the United States.

European literature underwent a major transformation during the ''Belle Époque''. [[Literary realism]] and [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] achieved new heights. Among the most famous French realist or naturalist authors are [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Émile Zola]]. Realism gradually developed into [[modernism]], which emerged in the 1890s and came to dominate European literature during the ''Belle Époque''{{'}}s final years and throughout the [[Interwar period|interwar years]]. The Modernist classic ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'' was begun by [[Marcel Proust]] in 1909, to be published after World War I. The works of German [[Thomas Mann]] had a huge impact in France as well, such as ''[[Death in Venice]]'', published in 1912. [[Colette]] shocked France with the publication of the sexually frank ''[[Claudine (book series)|Claudine]]'' novel series, and other works. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], who came to prominence in the mid-1880s, continued experimenting with themes and styles that would be associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and the [[Decadent movement]], mostly in his book ''[[à rebours]]''. [[André Gide]], [[Anatole France]], [[Alain-Fournier]], [[Paul Bourget]] are among France's most popular fiction writers of the era.

Among poets, the Symbolists such as [[Charles Baudelaire]] remained at the forefront. Although Baudelaire's poetry collection ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' had been published in the 1850s, it exerted a strong influence on the next generation of poets and artists. The Decadent movement fascinated Parisians, intrigued by [[Paul Verlaine]] and above all [[Arthur Rimbaud]], who became the archetypal ''[[enfant terrible]]'' of France. Rimbaud's ''[[Illuminations (poems)|Illuminations]]'' was published in 1886, and subsequently his other works were also published, influencing [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] and [[Modernism|Modernists]] during the ''Belle Époque'' and after. Rimbaud's poems were the first works of [[free verse]] seen by the French public. Free verse and typographic experimentation also emerged in ''[[Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Mallarmé)|Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard]]'' by [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], anticipating [[Dada]] and [[concrete poetry]]. [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s poetry introduced themes and imagery from modern life to readers. ''[[Cosmopolis: A Literary Review]]'' had a far-reaching impact on European writers, and ran editions in London, Paris, Saint Petersburg, and Berlin.

Paris's popular bourgeois theatre was dominated by the light farces of [[Georges Feydeau]] and [[cabaret]] performances. Theatre adopted new modern methods, including Expressionism, and many playwrights wrote plays that shocked contemporary audiences either with their frank depictions of everyday life and sexuality or with unusual artistic elements. Cabaret theater also became popular.

Musically, the ''Belle Époque'' was characterized by [[salon music]]. This was not considered serious music but, rather, short pieces considered accessible to a general audience. In addition to works for piano solo or violin and piano, the ''Belle Époque'' was famous for its large repertory of songs (mélodies, romanze, etc.). The Italians were the greatest proponents of this type of song, its greatest champion being [[Francesco Paolo Tosti]]. Though Tosti's songs never completely left the repertoire, salon music generally fell into a period of obscurity. Even as encores, singers were afraid to sing them at serious recitals. In that period, waltzes also flourished. [[Operetta]]s were also at the peak of their popularity, with composers such as [[Johann Strauss III]], [[Emmerich Kálmán]], and [[Franz Lehár]]. Many ''Belle Époque'' composers working in Paris are still popular today: [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Lili Boulanger]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[César Franck]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré]]  and his pupil, [[Maurice Ravel]].

[[Modern dance]] began to emerge as a powerful artistic development in theatre. Dancer [[Loie Fuller]] appeared at popular venues such as the [[Folies Bergère]], and took her eclectic performance style abroad as well. [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] brought fame to [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and established modern ballet technique. The Ballets Russes launched several ballet masterpieces, including ''[[The Firebird]]'' and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (sometimes causing audience riots at the same time).

'''Bric-à-brac''' or '''bric-a-brac''' (origin [[French language|French]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bric-a-brac Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; first used in the [[Victorian era]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' first reference in English: 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to lesser [[Objet d'art|objets d'art]] forming [[collecting|collections]] of [[wikt:curio|curio]]s, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or [[artificial flower|wax flowers]] under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]] or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on. 

In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on [[mantelpiece]]s, tables, and shelves, or was displayed in [[curio cabinet]]s: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. Today, "bric-à-brac" refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets and charity shops, and may be more commonly known in colloquial English as "knick knacks."

[[Edith Wharton]] and [[Ogden Codman, Jr.]], in ''The Decoration of Houses'' (1897), distinguished three gradations of quality in such "household ornaments": ''bric-à-brac'', ''bibelots'' ([[wikt:trinket|trinket]]s) and ''objets d'art''.&lt;ref&gt;"French speech... has provided at least three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible gradation of quality": Wharton and Codman, ''The Decoration of Houses'', 1897, Ch. XVI "Bric-à-brac" p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Israelinbritainb00garn 0005.jpg|thumb|An 1890 book advocating British Israelism. According to the doctrine, the Lost Ten tribes of Israel found their way to Western Europe and Britain, becoming the ancestors of the British and related peoples.]]

'''British Israelism''' (also called '''Anglo-Israelism''') is a movement which holds the view that the people of [[England]] (or more broadly, the people of the British Isles) are "genetically, racially, and linguistically the direct descendants" of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of ancient [[Israelites|Israel]].&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brackney|first1=William H.|title=Historical Dictionary of Radical Christianity|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810873650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhUvxfkWW2oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With roots in the 16th century, British Israelism was inspired by several 19th-century English writings such as John Wilson's 1840 ''Our Israelitish Origin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jack David|title=Introducing Anthropology of Religion: Culture to the Ultimate|date=2007|isbn=1138024910|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The movement never had a head organisation or a centralized structure.  Various British Israelite organisations were set up throughout the [[British Empire]] as well as in [[United States|America]] from the 1870s; a number of these organisations are active as of the early [[21st century]].  In America, its ideas gave rise to the [[Christian Identity]] movement.

The central tenets of British Israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern [[archaeology|archaeological]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J.

==History of the movement==

===Earliest recorded expressions===
According to Brackney (2012) and Fine (2015), the French [[Hugenots|Hugenot]] magistrate M. le Loyer's ''The Ten Lost Tribes'', published in 1590, provided the first expression that "Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and associated cultures"&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=Jonathan|year=2015|title=Political Violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: From Holy War to Modern Terror|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442247567|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjXHBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA176|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were direct descendants of the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"/&gt; Anglo-Israelism has also been attributed to [[Francis Drake]] and [[James VI and I]],&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"/&gt; who believed he was the King of Israel.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"/&gt; [[Adriaan van Schrieck]] (1560-1621), who influenced [[Henry Spelman]] (1562-1641) and [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]] (1615-1674), wrote in the early 17th century about his ideas on the origins of the Celtic and Saxon peoples. In 1649, Sadler published ''The Rights of the Kingdom'', "which argues for an 'Israelite genealogy for the British people'".&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"/&gt;

Aspects of British Israelism and its influences have also been traced to [[Richard Brothers]]' ''A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times'' in 1794, [[John Wilson (British Israelite)|John Wilson]]'s ''Our Israelitish Origin'' (1840s), and [[John Pym Yeatman]]'s ''The Shemetic Origin of the Nations of Western Europe'' (1879).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Foundation===
British Israelism arose in England, then spread to the United States.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parfitt|first1=Tudor|title=The lost tribes of Israel : the history of a myth|date=2003|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1842126653|edition=1st pbk. ed., 2nd impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–65}}  British-Israelists cite various medieval manuscripts to claim an older origin, but British Israelism as a distinct movement appeared in the early 1880s:

{{Quote|Although scattered British Israel societies are known to have existed as early as 1872, there was at first no real move to develop an organization beyond the small groups of believers which had arisen spontaneously. The beginnings of the movement as an identifiable religious force can, therefore, be more accurately placed in the 1880's when the circumstances of the time were particularly propitious for the appearance of a movement so imperialistically-orientated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.|title=British Israelism|journal=The Sociological Review|date=March 1968|volume=16|issue=1|pages=41–57|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.1968.tb01291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Peak adherence, end of the 19th and early 20th centuries===
[[Image:William Pascoe Goard.jpg|thumb|[[William Pascoe Goard]]]]
The extent to which the clergy in Britain became aware of the movement may be gauged from the comment made by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Henry Newman]] (1801–1890) when asked why he had left the [[Church of England]] in 1845 to join the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. He said that there was a very real danger that the movement "would take over the Church of England."&lt;ref name=Strong1986&gt;{{cite book|first=Patience|last=Strong|title=Someone had to say it|publisher=Bachman &amp; Turner, London|year=1986|isbn=978-0859741323}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}

In the later 19th century, [[Edward Hine]], [[Edward Wheeler Bird]], and [[Herbert Aldersmith]] developed the British Israelite movement.  Hine and Bird would achieve a degree of "doctrinal coherence" by seeing off competing forms of the ideology: in 1878 the Anglo-Ephraim Association of London, which followed Wilson in embraced the broader community of western European [[Germanic peoples]] among those they believed were favored by God, would be absorbed into Bird's Metropolitan Anglo-Israel Association, espousing the Anglo-exclusive view promoted by Hine.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

By the 1890s, the "Anglo-Israel Association" had 300 members; it was based in Britain and founded in 1879 by physician [[George Moore (physician)|George Moore]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Hine later departed for the United States where he promoted the idea.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|56}}

The 1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' stated that British Israelism's adherents "are said to number 2,000,000 in England and the United States",&lt;ref name=TJE600&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Anglo-Israelism|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|title= Jewish Encyclopedia: Anglo-Israelism |editor-first1= Isidore |editor-last1= Singer |editor-link= Isidore Singer |date= 1901 |publisher= [[Funk and Wagnalls]] |location=New York|page= 600 |url= http://d2b4hhdj1xs9hu.cloudfront.net/BJ1J6JJS.jpg |ASIN= B01K2CBAKE |ISBN= 978-1117918952}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unreliable figure if association membership and journal subscription numbers are any guide, though there would have been a broader, unmeasurable sympathy towards the views of the movement among Protestants globally.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Between 1899 and 1902, adherents of British Israelism dug up parts of the [[Hill of Tara]] in the belief that the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was buried there, doing much damage to one of [[Ireland]]'s most ancient royal and archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Indy media | place = [[Ireland|IE]] | url = http://www.indymedia.ie/article/71184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, British Israelism became associated with various pseudo-archaeological [[pyramidology]] theories, such as the notion that the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Khufu]] contained a prophetic numerology of the [[British peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Moshenska, G. (2008). 'The Bible in Stone': Pyramids, Lost Tribes and Alternative Archaeologies". ''Public Archaeology''. 7(1): 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the thirty-fourth year of its publication, the ''Anglo-Israel Almanac'' listed details of a large number of Kingdom Identity Groups operating independently throughout the British Isles and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1919, the [[British-Israel-World Federation]] (BIWF) was founded in London, and [[Covenant Publishing]] was founded in 1922. [[William Pascoe Goard]] was the first director of the publishing house. During this time, several prominent figures patronized the BIWF organization and its publisher; [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]] was Patron-in-chief in pre-World War II days. One of the highest profile members was [[William Massey]], then Prime Minister of [[New Zealand]]. Due to the expansive nature of the [[British Empire]], believers in British Israelism spread worldwide and the BIWF expanded its organization to the commonwealth. Howard Rand promoted the teaching and became National Commissioner of the [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]] in 1928. He published ''The Bulletin'', later renamed ''The Messenger of the Covenant''.  More recently, it has been renamed ''Destiny''.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|57}}

During its peak in the early 20th century, British Israelism was also supported by [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} A prolific author on British Israelism during the later 1930s and 40s was [[Alexander James Ferris]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Contemporary movement==
The BIWF continues to exist, with its main headquarters located in [[Bishop Auckland]] in [[County Durham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishisrael.co.uk/contact.php |title=Contact Us |website=The British-Israel-World Federation |publisher=The British-Israel-World Federation |access-date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has chapters in Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, New Zealand and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishisrael.co.uk/otherbiwfs.php |title=Other British-Israel Organisations |website=The British-Israel-World Federation |publisher=The British-Israel-World Federation |access-date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, one source estimated that there were between 3,000 and 5,000 British Israelites in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.|title=British Israelism: A Revitalization Movement in Contemporary Culture|journal=Archives de sociologie des religions|date=1 January 1968|volume=13|issue=26|pages=73–80|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/assr_0003-9659_1968_num_26_1_1808.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, the theology of British Israelism has been taught by a few small [[Pentecostal]] churches.  The espousal of British Israelism by [[George Jeffreys (pastor)|George Jeffreys]], founder of the [[Elim Pentecostal Church]], led to a [[schism]], precipitating his 1939 resignation and the formation of the [[Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship]],&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Allan Heaton|title=An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity|edition=2nd|year=2014|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to teach the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=B. R.|title=Contagious Conflict: The Impact of American Dissent on European Life|article=American Religion: Its Impact on Britain|editor-last=den Hollander|editor-first=A. N. J.|year=1973|location=Leiden|publisher=E. J. Brill|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbert Armstrong===

The teaching of British Israelism was vigorously promoted beginning in the 1960s by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]],&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|57}} founder and former Pastor General of the [[Grace Communion International#Worldwide Church of God|Worldwide Church of God]]. Armstrong believed that the teaching was a key to understanding [[biblical]] prophecy: "One might ask, were not biblical prophecies closed and sealed? Indeed they were—until now! And even now they can be understood only by those who possess the master key to unlock them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Armstrong | first = Herbert | title = The United States and Britain in Prophecy|year= 1967|page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong believed that he was called by God to proclaim the prophecies to the [[10 lost tribes|Lost Tribes]] of Israel before the "[[end-times]]".&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gci.org/prophecy/usb | last = Orr | first = R | title = How Anglo-Israelism Entered Seventh-day Churches of God: A history of the doctrine from John Wilson to Joseph W. Tkach | year = 1999 | accessdate = July 19, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} Armstrong's belief caused his separation from the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)|Church of God Seventh Day]] because of its refusal to adopt the teaching.

Armstrong created his own church, first called the "Radio Church of God" and later renamed the "[[Worldwide Church of God]]".&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;  He described British Israelism as a "central plank" of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Tkach, Jr.|Joseph Tkach]], [https://www.gci.org/aboutus/truth "Transformed by Truth: The Worldwide Church of God Rejects the Teachings of Founder Herbert W Armstrong and Embraces Historic Christianity. This is the Inside Story"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Armstrong's death, his former church abandoned its belief in British Israelism and changed its name to [[Grace Communion International]] (GCI) in 2009.  It offers an explanation for the doctrine's origin and its abandonment by the church at its official website.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt; Church members who disagreed with such doctrinal changes left the Worldwide Church of God/GCI to form offshoot churches. Many of these organizations still teach British Israelism, including the [[Philadelphia Church of God]], the [[Living Church of God]], and the [[United Church of God]]. Armstrong promoted other genealogical history theories, such as teaching the belief that modern-day [[Germany]] represents ancient [[Assyria]], writing "The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendants of the ancient Assyrians.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Herbert|title=Mystery of the Ages|year=1985|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==

===All Israelites Are Not Jews===
Adherents believe the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] are the twelve sons of the patriarch [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel). Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the tribe of Joseph.
A division occurred among the twelve tribes in the days of [[Jeroboam]] and [[Rehoboam]], with the three tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] and partially [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]], forming the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and the remaining ten tribes forming the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|page=vol. 15, p. 373|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they argue, "the great bulk of Israelites are not the Jews".&lt;ref name=Allen1917&gt;{{Cite book|last=Allen|first=J.H.|title=Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright|publisher=Destiny Publishers|year=1917|isbn=|edition=16|location=Haverhill, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmsworth’s History Volume 3|pages=1781–1782, 1784–1785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The DNA of Western European Nations|url=http://www.british-israel.com/dna-and-british-israel.html|website=British Israel Basics|publisher=Canadian British-Israel Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  W. E. Filmer, writing in 1964, suggested that the fact that some Jews continue to search for the ten lost tribes implies that their representatives are not found among modern, historically multi-ethnic, Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Filmer|first1=W. E.|title=A Synopsis of the Migrations of Israel|date=1964|publisher=Covenant Books|isbn=0852050615|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of British-Israelites quote [[Josephus]] to support their claim that the lost tribes of Israel are not the Jews: "the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephus|first1=Flavius|title=Antiquities|page=11:133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|247}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-israel.ca/answers.htm|title=British-Israel Answers its Critics|last=|first=|date=|website=The British-Israel Church of God|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=William Henry|title=Anglo-Israel; Or, The British Nation the Lost Tribes of Israel|date=1879|publisher=Bengough Bros.|isbn=1330950690|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British descent from the Lost Tribes===
[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]] kneeling at the feet of [[Shalmaneser III]] on the [[Black Obelisk]].]]
The key component of British Israelism is its representation of the migrations of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]]. Adherents suggested that the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Goths]] were representatives of these lost tribes, and progenitors of the later invaders of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|publisher=The Scarecros Press, Inc.|location=Lanham|year=2012|page=65|isbn=9780810861947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}  John Wilson would argue for the inclusion of all Western European Gothic peoples among the descendants of the Israelites, but under the later influence of Edward Hine the movement would come to view only the peoples of the British Isles as having this ancestry.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

[[File:Declaration of arbroath.jpg|thumb|The 'Tyninghame' copy of the Declaration from 1320 AD]]

Bede (died 735) had linked the [[Picts]] to the Scythians, but British Israelists suggested that he had confused the two tribes of Scotland, and that it was the ''Scotti'' (Scots) who were one with the ''Scoloti'' (Scyths) of Herodotus.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first=A. H.|title=History and Geography in Late Antiquity|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2005|pages=284–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They drew particular support from the derivation of the Scots from the Scythians found in the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]],&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|262}} reflecting a tradition related in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' that the Scots descended from the union of a Scythian exile with Scota, daughter of a [[Pharaoh]], a tale found in some form in several other early-14th-century historical and poetic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broun|first=Dauvit|title=The Irish Identity of the Kingdom of the Scots in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, England|year=1999|pages=78–79,119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most Holy Father and Lord, we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the Scots, has been graced with widespread renown. They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and the [[Pillars of Hercules]], and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by any race, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Arbroath - English Translation|url=http://www.constitution.org/scot/arbroath.htm|website=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British-Israel Associations cite the Declaration as evidence for the link between the Scots and the Scythians, and hence the Lost Tribes,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Cite book|title="Lost Israelite Identity": The Hebraic Ancestry of Celtic Races|last=Davidy|first=Yair|publisher=Brit-Am|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=240-242}}, {{cite book|last1=Ogwyn|first1=John H.|title=The United States and Britain in Prophecy|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as had been proposed by the early British Israelist etymologists.&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|285–296}}

Other [[Celts|Celtic invaders]] would be given an analogous descent.  In the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (''Cymry'') the British Israelists would see a direct connection through the [[Cimbri]] to the [[Cimmerians]], the ''Gimirri'' of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] annals,&lt;ref name=Pierard1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierard|first=Richard V.|contribution=The Contribution of British-Israelism to anti-Semitism within conservative Protestantism|title=Holocaust and church struggle: religion, power and the politics of resistance|editor-last=Locke|editor-first=Hubert G.|editor-last2=Littell|editor-first2=Marcia Sachs|publisher=University Press of America|year=1996|pages=44–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} a name sometimes also given by the ancient [[Babylonians]] to the Scythians and Saka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gershevych|first=Ilya|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, volume 2: The Median and Achaemenian Periods|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1985|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived similarity between this and the name by which the Assyrian annals referred to Israel, ''Beth Khumbree'', would lead the British Israelists to claim that the Welsh too were members of the Lost Tribes.&lt;ref name=Pierard1996/&gt;{{rp|57}}

According to the Anglo-Israelists, these claimed connections would make the British the literal descendants of the Lost Tribes, and thus inheritors of the promises made to the Israelites in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{book cite|last=Katz|first=David S.|contribution=Israel in America: The Wanderings of Lost Ten Tribes from ''Mikveigh Yisrael'' to Timothy McVeigh|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1450 to 1800|editor-last=Bernardini|editor-first=Paolo|editor-last2=Fiering|editor-first2=Norman|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|location=New York|year=2001|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adherents further claim that the [[British Royal Family]] is directly descended from the line of [[David|King David]].  Citing the ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'', they claim that the daughters of [[Zedekiah]] fled to Egypt, then 'the isles' in the sea, which they interpret as Ireland.  The descendants of these princesses are said to have crossed to England where they became ancestors of the monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hexham|first=Irving|contribution=British Israelism|title=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology|edition=2|editor-last=Elwell|editor-first=Walter A.|publisher=Baker Book House Company|location=Grand Rapids, MI|year=2001|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Stone of Scone]], used in coronations of Scottish, English and British monarchs for centuries, is claimed to be none other than the [[Stone of Jacob|pillow stone]] used by biblical patriarch, Jacob.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012" /&gt;

Adherents believe that these blessings have continued down through the ages to modern times, with the British Monarchy identified as the continued blessing upon Judah, and both Britain (Ephraim) and the USA (Manasseh) as recipients of the national birthright blessing. 
They cite passages such as 1 Chron 5:1-2 and  Gen 48:19-20 as supporting this.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Relation to Christian Identity==

Early British Israelites such as [[Edward Hine]] and [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]] were [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semites]].&lt;ref name=Gardell&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|year=2003|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|33}} British Israelism itself had several Jewish members and it received support from [[rabbi]]s throughout the 19th century.  Within British politics, the movement supported [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who was descended from [[Sephardi Jews]],&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|13–19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Life From The Dead'', 1875, Vol. III, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; while they also favoured [[Theodor Herzl]] in his advocacy of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardell /&gt;  Still, below the surface there had existed an anti-semitic strain such as in the [[scientific racialism]] that led Wilson to deny the 'racial purity' of modern Jews, leading to the view more broadly within the movement that modern Jews were 'un-Semitic impostors'.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006&gt;

{{quote|Once on American shores, British-Israelism began to evolve. Originally, believers viewed contemporary Jews as descendants of those ancient Israelites who had never been "lost." They might be seen critically but, given their significant role in the British-Israel genealogical scheme, not usually with animosity.

== Claims and criticism {{anchor|Claims and criticism}} ==
British Israelism has been criticized for poor research and scholarship. The ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' summarises in 1910 that: "The theory [of British-Israelism] rests on premises which are deemed by scholars - both theological and anthropological - to be utterly unsound".&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Britannica. 11th edn. 1910. Vol.II, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current scholarship is not consistent with the claims of British Israelism, with scholars drawing attention to its "historical and linguistic inaccuracies" in addition to its links to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012" /&gt;  Hale (2015) refers to "the overwhelming cultural, historical and genetic evidence against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Amy|editor1-last=Parker|editor1-first=Joanne|title=The Harp and the Constitution: Myths of Celtic and Gothic Origin|date=2016|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=9789004306370|language=English|chapter=Reigning with Swords of Meteoric Iron: Archangel Michael and the British New Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}}

===Research standards===
Critics of British Israelism note that the arguments presented by promoters of the teaching are based on unsubstantiated and highly speculative amateur research. [[Tudor Parfitt]], author of ''The Lost Tribes: The History of a Myth'', states that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is "of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre."&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Historical linguistics===
Some proponents of British Israelism have claimed numerous links in [[historical linguistics]] between ancient Hebrew and various European place names and languages.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|62}} This can be traced to the works of John Wilson in the 19th century. Wilson, who was self-trained, looked for similarities in the sounds of words and argued that many Scottish, British and Irish words stemmed from ancient Hebrew. Wilson's publications inspired the development of British Israel language associations in Europe.&lt;ref name=Quarles&gt;{{cite book | last = Quarles | first = Chester L | title = Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion | publisher = McFarland &amp; co | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=r5BzY2eeyngC | isbn = 978-0-78641892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

Modern scholarly linguistic analysis shows conclusively that the languages of the British Isles ([[English Language|English]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]) belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, while Hebrew is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warf|first=Barney|title=Encyclopedia of Human Geography|article=Language, Geography of|year=2006|location=Thousand Oaks CA|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, T. R. Lounsbury stated that “no trace of the slightest real connection can be discovered” between English and ancient Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lounsbury | first= T|title=History of the English Language|year= 1906|pages= 1, 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Michael Friedman in 1993 wrote of the claims that Hebrew was closely related to [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] that "the actual evidence could hardly be any weaker".&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Others have addressed the specific word relationships proposed.  Russell Spittler (1973) says of the "disputable" etymological claims made by the British Israelists that they "have no ample basis in linguistic scholarship and are based on coincidences only."&lt;ref name=Spittler /&gt;  William Ingram (1995) would present arguments made by British Israelism as examples of "tortured etymology".&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt;{{rp|121}}

===Scriptural interpretation===
Adherents of British Israelism cite various scriptures in support of the argument that the "lost" Northern Israelite Tribes migrated through Europe to end up in Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Dimont (1933) argues that British Israelists misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimont|first1=Charles T. |title=The legend of British-Israel|publisher=Society For Promoting Christian Knowledge|location=London|year=1933|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–7}}

One such case is the distinction that British Israelists make between the “[[Jews]]” of the Southern Kingdom and the “[[Israelites]]” of the Northern Kingdom. They believe that the [[Bible]] consistently distinguishes the two groups.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Dimont says that many of these scriptures are misinterpreted because the distinction between “Jews” and “Israelites” was lost over time after the captivities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

British Israelists believe that the Northern Tribes of Israel lost their identity after the captivity in Assyria and that this is reflected in the Bible. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Dimont disagrees with this assertion and argues that only higher ranking Israelites were deported from Israel and many Israelites remained.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|5}} He cites examples after the Assyrian captivity, such as [[Josiah]], King of Judah, who received money from the tribes of ''“Manasseh, and Ephraim and all the remnant of Israel”'' (2 Chronicles 34:9), and Hezekiah, who sent invitations not only to Judah, but also to northern Israel for the attendance of a [[Passover]] in [[Jerusalem]]. (2 Chronicles 30);&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|6}} British Israelites interpret 2 Chronicles 34:9 as referring to "Scythians".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dimont is also critical of the interpretations of biblical prophecy embraced by the movement, saying, "Texts are torn from their context, and misapplied without the slightest regard to their original meaning."&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Historical speculation===
British Israelism rests on linking different ancient populations. This includes linking the "lost" tribes of Israel with the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Celts]], and modern [[Western Europe]]ans such as the British. To support these links, some adherents believe that similarities exist between various cultural aspects of these population groups, and they argue that these links demonstrate the migration of the "lost" Israelites in a westerly direction. Examples given include [[burial]] customs, metalwork, clothing, dietary customs, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = UCG | url = http://www.ucg.org/booklets/US/archaelogical.htm | title = The United States and Britain in Bible Prophecy | accessdate = 2009-01-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205163627/http://www.ucg.org/booklets/us/archaelogical.htm# | archive-date = 2008-12-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimont argues that the customs of the Scythians and the Cimmerians are in contrast with those of the Ancient Israelites,&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|7–10}} and he further dismisses the connection between these populations and the Saxons and Celts, particularly criticing then-current formulations of British Israelism that would interject Semites between the closely related English and Germans.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

The Scythian origin of the Scots has been referred to as mythical.&lt;ref name=Todd1848&gt;{{cite book|last=Todd|first=James Henthorn|title=The Irish Version of the Historia Britonum of Nennius|year=1848|publisher=Irish Archæological Society|location=Dublin|p=xcvii|chapter=Editor's Preface|url=https://archive.org/details/irishversionhis00socigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klieforth&gt;{{cite book|last=Klieforth|first=Alexander Leslie|last2=Munro|first2=Robert John|title=The Scottish invention of America, Democracy and Human Rights: A History of Liberty and Freedom from the Ancient Celts to the New Millennium|publisher=University Press of America, Inc.|location=Dallas|year=2004|page=5|isbn=978-0761827917}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Algernon Herbert, writing in 1848, characterized the linguistic derivation of Scots from ''Scoloti'' as "strictly impossible",&lt;ref name=Todd1848 /&gt; and Merrill (2005) referred to it as [[false etymology]].&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

Addressing their view on the fate of the exiled tribes, Frank Boys would refer to their volumous output, "All the effort to write these volumes might well have been saved on the premise that 'they were never lost,' which we believe to be the correct one."&lt;ref name=Spittler /&gt;

===Ideology===
Parfitt suggests that the idea of British Israelism was inspired by numerous ideological factors, such as the desire for ordinary people to have a glorious ancestral past, pride in the British Empire, and the belief in the "racial superiority of [[white Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s",&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|62}}    and Aikau characterized the movement as "fundamentally about providing a rationale for Anglo-Saxon superiority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aikau|first= Hokulani K.|title=A Chosen People, a Promised Land: Mormonism and Race in Hawai'i|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|year=2012|page=38|isbn=978-0-8166-7462-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Kidd, its theology represents a "quasi-[[heresy]]", serving to "blunt the universalist message apparent in the [[New Testament]]".&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|204}}  Its role in fostering [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] in conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]] has been highlighted,&lt;ref name=Pierard1996/&gt;{{rp|57}} as has a "racial [[chauvinism]]" that is "not always covert".&lt;ref name=Ingram/&gt;{{rp|121–122}}

Separately, the mythology of British Israelism has been cited as fostering "nationalistic bellicosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Meic|last=Pearse|title=The Gods of War: Is Religion the Primary cause of Violent Conflict?|publisher=[[InterVarsity Press]]|year=2007|pages=104–105|isbn=978-0830834907}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To some adherents, British Israelism served as a justification for British [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], and perhaps even [[genocide]], while also feeding American [[Manifest Destiny]].&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|212–213}}

The Cantigny First Division Oral Histories [http://libx.bsu.edu/collection.php?CISOROOT=/CtgnyOrHis] are a collection of video [[oral history]] interviews with [[veterans]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]], commonly known as the Big Red One.  The First Division was the first permanent division in the regular Army, and is recognized by its ability to improve battlefield performance through learning experiences and its exceptional “[[esprit de corps]].”

The project preserves the memories of soldiers whose military service occurred around the globe. These oral histories provide first-hand resources for scholarly research in [[military history]] and [[US history]].  They address veterans’ experiences during the time periods of the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Cold War]].

In 2008, [[Ball State University]] History professors Dr. Michael William Doyle and Dr. David Ulbrich trained [[Ball State University]] students in oral history techniques and military history.  Under their supervision, students J. Chris Reidy, Steven Brown, and Rachel (Fulton) Coleman conducted interviews with forty First Division veterans residing in [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Kentucky]].  The Ball State University Teleplex videotaped the interviews and they were transcribed by [[Ball State University]] Libraries staff.

[[High-definition video]] and [[:wikt:transcript|transcripts]] of the interviews are available online via the Ball State University Libraries’ [[Digital Media Repository]] (DMR).  The online video,  [http://dvisweb1.bsu.edu/media/library/digital_media_repository/cantigny/reidy.asx Conversations across Generations: The Cantigny First Division Oral History Project Summer 2008], summarizes the project.

The Cantigny First Division Oral Histories project was funded by a grant from the Chicago-based McCormick Foundation with administrative support from the staff of the First Division Museum at [[Cantigny]].  Copies of the interviews and transcripts are also available at the Robert R. McCormick Research Center at the First Division Museum in [[Wheaton, Illinois]]. and Ball State University Libraries Archives and Special Collections in [[Muncie, Indiana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Chronological synchronism''' is an event that links two [[chronology|chronologies]]. For example, it is used in [[Egyptology]] to ground [[Egyptian chronology]]. The main types of chronological synchronism are synchronisms with other historical chronologies and synchronisms with precisely datable astronomical events.

Synchronisms with other chronologies often rely on some form of recorded communication between regions. For example, in Egyptology, the earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC, during the [[Amarna Period]] by the considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Akhenaten]] and various [[Near Eastern]] monarchs; that links Egyptian chronology with other Near Eastern chronologies.

Astronomical synchronisms rely on precise identification of astronomical events recorded in the historical record. The best known of these is the [[Sothic cycle]] whose careful study led [[Richard Anthony Parker]] to argue that the dates of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] could be fixed with absolute precision.&lt;ref&gt;Set forth in "Excursus C: The Twelfth dynasty" in his ''The Calendars of ancient Egypt'' (Chicago: University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has eroded that confidence and questioned many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle. As a result, experts have moved away from relying on it.&lt;ref&gt;One example is Patrick O'Mara, "Censorinus, the Sothic Cycle, and calendar year one in ancient Egypt: the Epistological problem", ''Journal of Near Eastern studies'', '''62''' (2003), pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">A '''concert party''', also called a '''Pierrot troupe''', is the collective name for a group of entertainers, or [[Pierrot#England 2|Pierrots]], popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the first half of the 20th century. The [[variety show]] given by a Pierrot troupe was called a '''Pierrot show'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb029ms225 |title=Papers relating to English concert parties and pierrot shows |publisher=[[Archives Hub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-end-of-the-pierrot-show-1087139.html |title=Theatre: End of the pierrot show |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert parties were travelling shows of songs and comedy, often put on at the seaside and opening with a Pierrot
number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English filming, English writing |last=Jefferson Hunter |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= |page=226 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbnHvxuby54C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=A+concert+party,+also+called+a+Pierrot+troupe,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iM3dTq-xJ4n54QSD28XTBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex returned from France, having admired the Pierrots he had seen there, and decided to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus began the tradition of seaside Pierrots in [[pointed hat]]s and black or coloured costumes who sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of [[Brighton]], [[Margate]] and [[Blackpool]] from the 1890s until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See Pertwee.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of performance attracted artists from [[music hall]] and variety theatre. Some performers, such as [[Neville Kennard]], were known as specialists in the field.

Immensely popular in Great Britain from the 1920s to the 1940s, concert parties were also formed by several countries' [[armed forces]] during the First and [[Second World War]]s. During the Second World War, the British Armed Forces' concert party became known as the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA), later succeeded by the [[Combined Services Entertainment]] (CSE).

As other forms of entertainment (particularly [[television]]) replaced variety shows in general, concert parties largely died out during the 1950s. This form of entertainment has been described by [[Roy Hudd]] as long-gone and much lamented.&lt;ref name="Hudd"&gt;Roy Hudd, Philip Hindin, ''Roy Hudd's cavalcade of variety acts: a who was who of light entertainment, 1945-60'', 1997, p94&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous fictitious concert party outside the armed forces was ''[[The Good Companions]]'' in [[J. B. Priestley]]'s eponymous novel. In the novel [[Sylvia Scarlett]], the main characters ([[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the film version) form a concert party, The Pink Pierrots.

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5253">[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Criterion of multiple attestation:  [[Last Supper]]]]
The '''criterion of multiple attestation''' or ''independent attestation'' is a tool used by [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] to help determine whether certain actions or sayings by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] are from [[Historical Jesus]]. Simply put, the more independent witnesses that report an event or saying, the better. See [[Criteria of authenticity and the Historical Jesus]].

== Examples of its use ==
The gospels are not always independent of each other. Matthew and Luke, for example, are likely dependent on Mark. The ''criterion of multiple attestation''  focuses on the sayings or deeds of Jesus that are attested to in more than one independent literary source such as [[Apostle Paul]], [[Josephus]], [[Q source|Q]] and/or the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]. The force of this criterion is increased if a given motif or theme is also found in  different literary forms such as parables, dispute stories, miracle stories, prophecy, and/or aphorism.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine M. Murphy, ''The Historical Jesus For Dummies'', For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14, 61-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple attestation has a certain kind of objectivity. Given the ''independence'' of the sources, satisfaction of the criterion makes it harder to maintain that it was an invention of the Church. Still, this criterion, however useful, is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of discontinuity]] and the [[criterion of embarrassment]], along with the [[historical method]].

For example the "[[Kingdom of God]]" ''motif'' appears in "Mark, Q, the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', special Lucan tradition, and John, with echoes in Paul, despite the fact that 'Kingdom of God' is not Paul's preferred way of speaking." It also appears in an array of literary genres.
The ''words'' attributed to Jesus on the bread and wine during the [[Last Supper]] (found in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], the [[Didache]] and arguably in [[Gospel of John|John]]) and on divorce (found in Mark and Paul) are examples of sayings that are multiply attested.
An example of an ''event'' that is multiply attested is Jesus's meeting with [[John the Baptist]] (found in Mark and John). &lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]],'' Oxford, 1999. pp  90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'',  Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals'' Sheffield Academic Press,  2000.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Gerd Thiessen|Thiessen, &amp; Dagmar Winter.  ''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
This criterion cannot be used for sources that are not independent. For example, a saying that occurs in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] may only represent one source. Under the [[two-source hypothesis]], both the authors of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] used the Gospel of Mark in their writings; therefore, triple-tradition material represents only a single source, Mark. (The [[Augustinian hypothesis]] posits that Mark and Luke used Matthew, so once again triple-tradition material would have originated in a single source). Another limitation is that some sayings or deeds attributed to Jesus could have originated in the first Christian communities early enough in the tradition to be attested to by a number of independent sources, thus not representing the [[historical Jesus]]. Finally, there are some sayings or deeds of Jesus that only appear in one form or source that scholars still consider historically probable. Multiple attestation is not always a requisite for historicity, nor is it enough to determine accuracy by itself. 

The criterion is one of a number of factors that have been developed by scholars to assess whether a tradition is likely to be historical; the widely-recognized criteria were distinguished by Stanley E. Porter as [[Criterion of dissimilarity|dissimilarity]], [[Criterion of coherence|coherence]], multiple attestation, least distinctiveness and Aramaic linguistic background. Porter suggests three new criteria in the search for the words of the [[Historicity of Jesus|historical Jesus]] (Porter 2000), which have not yet found broad acceptance: a criterion of Greek language, of Greek textual variance and of "discourse features" at variance with the text's usual style. Of the criterion of multiple attestations, Porter makes the point, which has been expressed before, that multiple attestations identify common motifs rather than absolute wording, and speak only to the independence of documents and not their reliability (Porter 2000:86).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5294">'''Critical historiography''' approaches the [[history of art]], [[history of literature|literature]] or [[history of architecture|architecture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. Critical [[historiography]] is used by various scholars in recent decades to emphasize the ambiguous relationship between the past and the writing of history. Specifically, it is used as a method by which one understands the past and can be applied in various fields of academic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuyorganics: Organic Intellectualism, the Search for Racial Identity, and Nuyorican Thought|last=Bernard-Carreño|first=Regina|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=9781433106101|location=New York|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Concept ==
While historiography is concerned with the theory and history of historical writing, including the study of the developmental trajectory of history as a [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]], critical historiography addresses how historians or historical authors have been influenced by their own groups and loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historiography of Persian Architecture|last=Gharipour|first=Mohammad|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138915022|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is an assumption that historical sources should not be taken at face value and has to be examined critically according to scholarly criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures of Wissenschaft des Judentums at 200|last=Thulin|first=Mirjam|publisher=Universitätsverlag Potsdam|year=2018|isbn=9783869564401|location=Potsdam|pages=70-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some authors trace the origin of this field in nineteenth-century [[Germany]], particularly with ''[[Leopold von Ranke]]'', one of the proponents of the concept of ''[[Wissenschaft]]'', which means "critical history" or "scientific history", which viewed historiography as a rigorous, critical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing: A-J|last=Woolf|first=Daniel|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=0815315147|location=New York|pages=819}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the application of ''Wissenschaft'' to the study of [[Judaism]], it is maintained that there is an implied criticism of the stand of those advocating Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said to reveal the tendency of nationalist historians to favor the pious affirmation of the orthodox in attempts to restore pride in Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-history|last=Biale|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1982|isbn=0674363329|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of critical historiography can be seen in the work of [[Harold Bloom]].  In ''Map of Misreading'', Bloom argued that poets should not be seen as autonomous agents of creativity, but rather as part of a history that transcends their own production and that to a large degree gives it shape. The historian can try to stabilize poetic production so as to better understand the work of art, but can never completely extract the historical subject from history. 

Also among those who argue for the primacy of historiography is the architectural historian [[Mark Jarzombek]]. The focus of this work is on disciplinary production rather than poetic production, as was the case with Bloom. Since psychology – which became a more or less official science in the 1880s – is now so pervasive, Jarzombek argued, but yet so difficult to pinpoint, the traditional dualism of subjectivity and objectivity has become not only highly ambiguous, but also the site of a complex negotiation that needs to take place between the historian and the discipline. The issue, for Jarzombek, is particular poignant in the fields of art and architectural history, the principal subject of the book. [[Pierre Nora]]'s notion of "ego-histories" also moves in the direction of critical historiography. The idea of these histories is to bring into focus the relationship between the personality of historians and their life choices in the process of writing of history.

A critique of critical historiography cites the risk of judging the realities of the past by the yardstick of what is true in the present so that it becomes illusory and can obscure identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FeVdNxyFiKsC&amp;pg=RA3-PT326&amp;dq=Critical+historiography+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp6umXqdDeAhUDFYgKHZDDDqYQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Critical%20historiography%20definition&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of History and Historiography|last=Tucker|first=Aviezer|date=2011-06-28|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444351521|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22723">[[File:Lambrechtshagen Kirche Empore4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail from the church of Lambrechtshagen, Germany, 1759: [[Daniel in the lions' den]] with Darius the Mede above.]]
'''Darius the Mede''' is mentioned in the [[Book of Daniel]] as king of [[Babylon]] between [[Belshazzar]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], but he is not known to history, and no additional king can be placed between the known figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}} Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or [[Gubaru|Ugbaru]], the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}}

==In the Book of Daniel==
Darius the Mede is first mentioned in the story of [[Belshazzar's feast]] (Daniel 5). Belshazzar, king of [[Babylon]], holds a great feast, during which a hand appears and writes on the wall: "''MENE'', ''MENE'', ''TEKEL'', and ''PARSIN''" ({{Hebrew|מנא מנא תקל ופרסין}}). Daniel interprets the words: Belshazzar has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom is to be divided between the [[Medes]] and Persians. The story concludes: "That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom."{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=74-75}} 

In the story of [[Daniel in the lions' den]] (Daniel 6), Daniel has continued to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but to Darius himself, on pain of death. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and Darius, although deeply distressed, must condemn him to be thrown into the lions' den because the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and Daniel tells him that his God sent an angel to save him. Darius commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=85-86}}

The final appearance of Darius is in [[Daniel 9]], which presents a vision of Daniel relating to the end-time travails and triumph of the Israelites over their enemies. The mention of Darius is used as a chronological marker, placing the vision in "the first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]]".{{sfn|Knibb|2006|p=435}}

==Historical and literary background==
[[Image:Cyrus invasion of Babylonia.svg|right|thumb|250px|The Persian invasion of Babylonia, September–October 539 BC, showing Gutium, Opis, and Babylon.]]

===The Medes and the fall of Babylon===
The [[Medes]] came to prominence in 612 BCE when they joined with the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonians]] in overthrowing [[Neo-Assyrian empire|Assyria]]. Little is known about them, but they were possibly a significant power in the Middle East for several decades thereafter. The fall of their empire is recorded in a Babylonian inscription from around 553 BCE  (a second report puts the event in 550 BCE) reporting that the Median king has been conquered by "[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], king of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]," in south-western Iran: this is the first appearance of Cyrus in the historical record, and the beginning of the rapid rise of the [[Achaemenid empire|Persians]].

After extending his empire from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, Cyrus turned his attention to Babylonia. The most important ancient sources for his conquest of Babylon are the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] ([[Nabonidus]] was the last Babylonian king, and [[Belshazzar]], who is described as king of Babylon in the Book of Daniel, was his son and crown prince), the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], and the Verse Account of Nabonidus&amp;mdash;which, despite its name, was commissioned by Cyrus.{{sfn|Waters|2014|p=38-39,43}}

Cyrus' Babylonian campaign began in 539 BCE, although there were presumably previous tensions. On 10 October Cyrus won a battle at [[Battle of Opis|Opis]], opening the way to Babylon, and on 12 October "[[Gubaru|Ugbaru]], governor of the district of [[Gutium]], and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon without a battle" (Babylonian Chronicle). Ugbaru is presumably the same person as the Gorbyras mentioned by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]], a Babylonian provincial governor who switched to the Persian side. Cyrus made his entrance into the city a few days later; Nabonidus was captured and his life spared, but nothing is known of the fate of Belshazzar.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=41-42}}

===The Book of Daniel===
The [[Book of Daniel]] is not regarded by scholars as a reliable guide to history.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=1}} The broad consensus is that Daniel never existed, and that the author appears to have taken the name from a legendary hero of the distant past mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219-220}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3-4}} The book that bears his name is an [[apocalypse]], not a book of prophecy, and its contents form a cryptic allusion to the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (reigned 175–164 BCE).{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=29}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=74}} There is broad agreement that the stories making up chapters 1&amp;ndash;6 are legendary in character, and that the visions of chapters 7&amp;ndash;12 were added during the persecution of Antiochus, the book itself being completed soon after 164 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}

[[Daniel 5]] and [[Daniel 6]] belong to the folktales making up the first half of the book.{{sfn|Mobley|2012|p=135-136}} The language of Daniel 5 ("Belshazzar's Feast"), for example, follows ancient Near Eastern conventions which are in some cases precisely those used in Daniel.{{sfn|Paul|2002|p=59}} Daniel 6 ("Daniel in the Lions' Den") is based on the classic Babylonian folk-tale "Ludlul-bel-nemeqi", telling of a courtier who suffers disgrace at the hands of evil enemies but is eventually restored due to the intervention of a kindly god (in the story in Daniel, this is the God of Israel): in the Babylonian original the "pit of lions" is a metaphor for human adversaries at court, but the biblical tale has turned the metaphorical lions into real animals.{{sfn|Van Der Toorn|2001|p=43}}

In [[Daniel 9]] Daniel, pondering the meaning of [[Jeremiah]]'s prediction that [[Jerusalem]] would remain desolate for seventy years, is told by the angel [[Gabriel]] that the 70 years should be taken to mean seventy weeks (literally "sevens") of years.{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=75}} Verse 1 sets the time of Daniel's vision as the "first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]], by birth a Mede",{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=1251 fn.9.1-19}} but no Darius is known to history, nor can any king of Babylon be placed between the genuine historical figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}}

==Identity==
[[Image:Achaemenid coin daric 420BC front.jpg|thumb|right|Gold [[Persian daric]] (with a purity of 95.83%) issued by Darius the Great, c. 490 BCE).]]
[[H. H. Rowley]]'s 1935 study of the question (''Darius the Mede and the Four World Empires of Darius the Mede'', 1935) demonstrated that Darius the Mede cannot be identified with any king,{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} and he is generally seen today as a literary fiction combining the historical Persian king [[Darius I]] and the words of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 51:11 that God "stirred up" the Medes against Babylon.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}} Nevertheless, numerous attempts have been made to identify him with historical figures, with the following being perhaps the best-known candidates:{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} 
 
*[[Darius the Great]] (Darius I Hystaspes), c. 550–486 BCE. This historically known Darius was the third Persian emperor, and an important figure for Jews in the early Persian period because of his role in the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=95}} At the beginning of his career Darius had to (re)conquer Babylon to remove a usurper, before expanding the empire and dividing it into satrapies.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=115}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}} The author of Daniel, mindful of certain prophecies that the Medes would destroy Babylon (Jeremiah 51:11,28 and Isaiah 13:17), and needing a Median king to complete his four-kingdom schema (see the story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in [[Daniel 2]]), appears to have taken the historic Darius and projected him into a fictional past.{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}
*[[Astyages]]. Astyages was the last king of the Medes; he was defeated by Cyrus in 550 (or 553), his father was named Cyaxares (not Ahasuerus/Xerxes), and there is no record of him being present at the fall of Babylon. Consequently, he gets little attention in modern apologetics, but the 1st century CE Jewish historian Josephus, followed later by the early Christian Church Father [[Jerome]], harmonised Daniel with the historical sources by claiming that Darius the Mede was a son of Astyages.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}
*"[[Cyaxares II]]". The Greek writer [[Xenophon]] tells of a Median king called Cyaxares who was the son of Astyages - other Greek historians say that Astyages had no son. According to Xenophon, Cyrus became king of Media through marriage to Cyraxares' daughter – contradicting all other sources, notably the Babylonian, which say Cyrus won Media by conquest from Astyages. Xenophon is not given credence by historians, and he does not, in any case, say that his otherwise unknown Cyaxares ruled Babylon.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231-232}}
*[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]. This argument hinges on a reinterpretation of Daniel 6:28, ""Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian", to read "Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, even the reign of Cyrus the Persian", making them the same individual. William Shea, a conservative scholar, comments that it would be strange to refer to Cyrus the Persian, son of [[Cambyses I]], as Darius the Mede, son of Ahasuerus, and strange also to refer to the same king as Cyrus in some passages and Darius in others.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=232-233}}
*[[Cambyses II]]. Cambyses was Cyrus' son and his successor as emperor. The Babylonian records indicate that Cyrus installed him as regent in Babylon, but he was not a Mede, his father was not Ahasuerus, and he was probably not 62 years old.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=233}}
*[[Gubaru]] (or Ugbaru, called Gobryas in Greek sources), the general who was the first to enter Babylon. Ugbaru was the Babylonian governor of Gutium (an area closely associated with Media in Babylonian sources) before switching sides to the Persians, and Cyrus seems to have given him administrative responsibility for Babylon after its capture, but he never held the title "King of Babylon".{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}}

Proponents of deep history argue for a definition of [[history]] that rests not upon the invention of [[writing]], but upon the evolution of [[anatomically modern humans]]. According to [[Daniel Lord Smail]], perhaps the most prominent advocate of Deep History, the concept of prehistory is recast as an arbitrary boundary that limits the ''[[longue durée]]'' perspective of historians, and which rests upon assumptions that history follows a teleological path beginning with the origins of [[civilization]] in [[Ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lord Smail, ''On Deep History and the Brain'' (University of California Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smail suggests that advances in disciplines such as [[neurobiology]] and [[neurophysiology]] and [[genetics]] mean that there are more possibilities for understanding the distant past, and offer opportunities to explain how events such as biological evolution, global environmental change, and patterns of the spread of disease have affected humanity today.&lt;ref name=twsMedHistory&gt;Stephen T Casper (reviewer); Med Hist. 2009 Apr; 53(2): 318–319; {{PMC|2668893}}; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668893/ Book Reviews -- On deep history and the brain]; Review of book by: Daniel Lord Smail, ''On deep history and the brain'' published by Berkeley and London,  University of California Press,  2008, pp. xiv, 271, 978-0-520-25289-9, Accessed January 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of Deep History generally do not acknowledge what they claim to be the traditional barrier between conventional history, generally based on written documentation such as ancient scrolls or hieroglyphs on pyramids, and unwritten prehistory, based on archaeology, in the human past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History Manifesto|last = Guldi, Armitage|first = Jo, David|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-107-43243-7|location = Cambridge|pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Smail's book by [[Steven Mithen]], professor of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Reading]], is sympathethic to some parts of his thesis, but says  "Smail may not be as closely acquainted with the ongoing debates in prehistoric archaeology as he might be", and on Smail's critical description of historians: "I have to take Smail’s word for it that such historians still exist, as after more than a century of prehistoric archaeology they would be an astonishing throwback to another age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mithen, Steven|Steven Mithen]], [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/steven-mithen/when-we-were-nicer "When We Were Nicer"], a review of ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, ''[[London Review of Books]]'', Vol. 30 No. 2, 24 January 2008, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emiran culture''' was a culture that existed in the [[Levant]] ([[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) between the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and the [[Upper Paleolithic]] periods.

Emiran culture apparently developed from the local [[Mousterian]] without rupture, keeping numerous elements of the Levalloise-Mousterian, together with the locally typical [[Emireh point]]. The Emireh point is the type tool of stage one of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], first identified in the Emiran culture.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 48 &amp; Figure IV, 4, p. 150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous stone blade tools were used, including curved knives similar to those found in the [[Chatelperronian]] culture of Western Europe.

The Emiran eventually evolved into the [[Antelian]] culture, still of Levalloise tradition but with some [[Aurignacian]] influences.

According to [[Dorothy Garrod]], the Emireh point, known from several sites in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],  is the hallmark of this culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vROM3JrrRa0C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=emireh+point+israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KwCNSnaJb6&amp;sig=8QNCT80dYEbXlgEumNarGonX02o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_7RBUbD0GLLY4QTXg4DABQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=emireh%20point%20israel&amp;f=true Archaeology in Cultural Systems, Sally R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15772">{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}

The process that has been described as the '''genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil''' began with the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], when [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] made landfall in what is now the country of Brazil in 1500. This started the process that led to the depopulation of the [[indigenous peoples in Brazil]], because of disease and violent treatment by European settlers, and their gradual replacement with colonists from Europe and Africa. This process has been described as a genocide, and continues into the modern era with the ongoing destruction of indigenous peoples of the Amazonian region.&lt;ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherrer 2003 p294" /&gt;

Over eighty indigenous tribes were destroyed between 1900 and 1957, and the overall indigenous population declined by over eighty percent, from over one million to around two hundred thousand.&lt;ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" /&gt;  The [[Constitution|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognises indigenous peoples' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their "traditional lands", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;Federal Constitution of Brazil. [http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleVIII.html Chapter VII Article 231].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, Brazil's indigenous people still face a number of external threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="US DoS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Human Rights Report: Brazil|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119150.htm|publisher=United States Department of State: Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of demarcation is slow—often involving protracted legal battles—and [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] do not have sufficient resources to enforce the legal protection on indigenous land.&lt;ref name="ISA Intro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Lands &gt; Introduction &gt; About Lands|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/c/terras-indigenas/introducao/o-que-sao-terras-indigenas|work=Povos Indígenas no Brasil|publisher=Instituo Socioambiental (ISA)|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US DoS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borges|first=Beto|last2=Combrisson|first2=Gilles|title=Indigenous Rights in Brazil: Stagnation to Political Impasse|url=http://saiic.nativeweb.org/brazil.html|publisher=South and Meso American Indian Rights Center|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartzman|first=Stephan|last2=Valéria Araújo|first2=Ana|last3=Pankararú|first3=Paulo|title=Brazil: The Legal Battle Over Indigenous Land Rights|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|year=1996|volume=29|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=95702149|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian Indians 'win land case'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7774895.stm|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s there has been a boom in the exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging and cattle ranching, posing a severe threat to the region's indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for indigenous peoples' traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations and spread disease.&lt;ref name="US DoS" /&gt; Peoples such as the [[Akuntsu]] and [[Kanoê]] have been brought to the brink of extinction within the last three decades.&lt;ref name="ISA Akuntsu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction &gt; Akuntsu|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/akuntsu|work=Povos Indígenas no Brasil|accessdate=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISA Kanoe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction &gt; Kanoê|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/kanoe|work=Povos Indígenas no Brasil|accessdate=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2012, the national indigenous peoples association from Brazil APIB submitted to the United Nation a human rights  document with complaints about new proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2866 |title=English version of human rights complaint document submitted to the United Nations by the National Indigenous Peoples Organization from Brazil (APIB) |publisher=Earth Peoples |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed due to the ongoing persecution of the indigenous peoples in Brazil, and international pressure has been brought to bear on the state after the release of the [[Figueiredo Report]] which documented massive human rights violations.

The abuses have been described as [[genocide]], [[ethnocide]] and [[cultural genocide]].

== Affected tribes ==
{{See|List of extinct indigenous peoples of Brazil}}

In the 1940s the state and the [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|Indian Protection Service]] (IPS) forcibly relocated the [[Aikanã]], [[Kanôc]], [[Kwaza people|Kwazá]] and [[Salamái]] tribes to work on rubber plantations. During the journey many of the indigenous peoples starved to death, those who survived the journey were placed in an IPS settlement called Posto Ricardo Franco. These actions resulted in the near extinction of the Kanôc tribe.&lt;ref name="Van Der Voort 2004 p5" /&gt;

The ethnocide of the Yanomami has been well documented, there are an estimated nine thousand currently living in Brazil in the Upper Orinoco drainage and a further fifteen thousand in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013 p628" /&gt; The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.&lt;ref name="Kopenawa Yanomami 2013" /&gt;

The [[Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau]], whose territory has been protected by law since 1991, saw an influx of an estimated 800 people in 2007. The tribal leaders met with the civil authorities and demanded the trespassers be evicted. This tribe, initially contacted in 1981, saw a severe decline in population after disease was introduced by settlers and miners. Their numbers are now estimated at a few hundred.&lt;ref name="Survival International 2007" /&gt;

== Portuguese colonization ==

During the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], Cabral made landfall off the atlantic coast. Over the following decade the indigenous [[Tupí people|Tupí]], [[Tapuya]] and other tribes which lived along the coast suffered large depopulation due to disease and violence. A process of miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Ribeiro – O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that of the 2.5 million indigenous peoples who had lived in the region which now comprises Brazil, less than 10 per cent survived to the 1600s.&lt;ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /&gt; The primarily reason for depopulation was diseases such as smallpox that advanced far beyond movement of European settlers.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=''BBC Four''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State reaction ==

In 1952 Brazil ratified the [[Genocide Convention|genocide convention]] and incorporated into their penal laws [[Genocide Convention#Definition of_genocide|article II]] of the convention.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /&gt; While the statute was being drafted, Brazil argued against the inclusion of cultural genocide, claiming that some minority groups may use it to oppose the normal assimilation which occurs in a new country. According to professor of law at [[Vanderbilt University]] Larry May, the argument put forward by Brazil was significant, but cultural genocide should not be cast aside, and this type of genocide should be included within the definition of genocide.&lt;ref name="May 2010 p103" /&gt;

In 1967 public prosecutor Jader de Figueiredo Correia, submitted the Figueiredo Report to the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]] which was then ruling the country. The report, which ran seven thousand pages, remained hidden for over forty years. Its release caused an international furore. The rediscovered documents are being examined by the [[National Truth Commission]] which has been tasked with the investigations of human rights violations which occurred in the periods 1947 through to 1988. The report reveals that the IPS had enslaved indigenous people, tortured children and stolen land. The Truth Commission is of the opinion that entire tribes in [[Maranhão]] were completely eradicated and in [[Mato Grosso]], an attack on thirty [[Cinta Larga people|Cinturão Largo]] left only two survivors. The report also states that landowners and members of the IPS had entered isolated villages and deliberately introduced [[smallpox]]. Of the one hundred and thirty four people accused in the report the state has as yet not tried a single one.&lt;ref name="Watts 19 May 2013" /&gt; The report also detailed instances of mass killings, rapes, and torture. Figueiredo stated that the actions of the IPS had left the indigenous peoples near extinction. The state abolished the IPS following the release of the report. The [[Red Cross]] launched an investigation after further allegations of [[ethnic cleansing]] were made after the IPS had been replaced.&lt;ref name="Garfield 2001 p143" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren 2001 p84" /&gt;

In 1992 a group who had been prospecting for gold were tried for the attempted genocide of the Yanomami tribe. A report from an anthropologist, which was submitted as evidence during the trial, stated that the prospectors' entry into Yanomami territory had an adverse effect on their lives, as the prospectors carried diseases. They had also contaminated the rivers which the Yanomami used as a source of food.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /&gt; The UN reported that thousands of the Yanomami have been killed as the Brazilian government failed to enforce the law, and that even after though the Yanomami peoples territory had been demarcated the state had not provided the necessary resources to stop the illegal incursion of gold prospectors. These prospectors have caused massive forest fires which have led to the destruction of extensive areas of both croplands and rainforest.&lt;ref name="Travis 2013 pp147-148" /&gt;

== International reaction ==

At the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in Brazil the [[Kari-Oka Declaration]] and the [[Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter]] were presented by the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world. The Kari-Oka Declaration states "We continue to maintain our rights as peoples despite centuries of deprivation, assimilation and genocide". The declaration also asserted that the genocide convention must be amended so as to include the genocide of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Totten 2010 p4" /&gt; The [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs]] (IWGIA) was founded in 1968 in response to the genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil and [[Paraguay]], and in 1969 [[Survival International]] was founded in London as a response to the atrocities, theft of land and genocide occurring in the [[Amazônia Legal|Brazilian Amazon]]. In 1972 anthropologists from [[Harvard university]] founded [[Cultural survival]].&lt;ref name="Morgan 2011 p65" /&gt;

The World Bank has been subject to criticism over loans which have been used to help fund the dislocation of indigenous peoples and environmental destruction. The Polonoreste project caused  wholesale [[Deforestation in Brazil|deforestation]], ecological damage on a wide scale, as well as the forced relocation of indigenous communities. The project led to an international campaign which resulted in the World Bank suspending loans.&lt;ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" /&gt;

'''''Head in Flames''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by Chiasmus Press in 2009.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''Head in Flames'' is a collage novel built on a triadic structure. First [[Vincent van Gogh]] speaks briefly (sometimes only a sentence, sometimes a handful) in the first person in a [[Times New Roman|Times font]]. Next [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] does the same in the third person in Times bold. Last [[Mohammed Bouyeri]] speaks in the second person in a [[Courier (typeface)|Courier font]]. This pattern repeats for the length of the text. The effect is more musical than narrative in a conventional sense.

Van Gogh finds himself standing in a field in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] in July 1890, debating whether or not to commit suicide. Theo finds himself riding to work on the day he was assassinated in [[Amsterdam]] in November 2004 by Mohammed, an extremist outraged by the filmmaker's collaboration with controversial politician [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] on a 10-minute experimental short critiquing Muslim subjugation and abuse of women.

The consequence of such a structure is a complex investigation into art's multiplicity of purpose, religion's increasingly dominant role as engine of politics and extremism in the contemporary world, the complexities involved in foreignness/assimilation, and the limits of cultural tolerance.

==Reception==
''[[Rain Taxi]]'' wrote that ''Head in Flames'' is "distinguished both by its inventive, playful form and its evocative content,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=O Muse of Fire…|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2010summer/olsen.shtml|accessdate=8 December 2012|journal=Rain Taxi|date=Summer 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Review of Contemporary Fiction'' called Olsen's novel "an important book" whose "structure is a tour de force of formal innovation calling to mind [[Robert Pinget|Pinget]]'s ''That Voice,'' [[Juan Rulfo|Rulfo]]’s [[Pedro Páramo]], and [[Julio Cortazar|Cortázar]]’s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortazar novel)|Hopscotch]]''…. Olsen’s real success lies not in his critique of the many forms of intolerance but rather in his affirmation of art as salvation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Head in Flames|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&amp;GCOI=15647100710110&amp;extrasfile=7DBDDA4C-1D09-67E0-43C6D06F82918E8F.html|accessdate=8 December 2012|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hispanismo''' or '''Hispanicism''' is an [[ideology]], [[school of thought]] and [[historiography|historiographic current]] centered on [[Spain|Spanish]] heritage. In [[Hispanic America]] it is similar but unlike most times to [[indigenismo]].&lt;ref name=Montoya1998&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montoya Iriarte |first=Urpi |date=1998 |title=Hispanismo e Indigenismo: o dualismo cultural no pensamento social peruano (1900-1930).

In the case of [[Hispanic America]] these cultural roots are Spanish and indigenous. An important detail is that in hispanismo the Spanish roots are implicitly more important than the indigenous roots. Hispanismo consist of Hispanic American countries building upon their "own heritage" which would be the same as Spanish heritage.&lt;ref name=Gong&gt;{{cite book |last=Góngora |first=Alvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |date= |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |url= |language=Spanish |location= |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=224–225 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''Because of that the Spaniard is not yet another element in the ethnic conglomerate. He is the decisive factor, the only one that could attract them all... Because of this any attempt to forget the Spanish name in these lands and oppose to him a hyperbolic renewed value of the indigenous, would go straight to attack the lifeblood that unite our peoples. Anything worthy that the ancient civilizations could have had at the moment of decadence when they faced the Spanish conquest was saved and defended by the Spaniards themselves who took with them just in time the instrument of writing, unknown to the indigenous peoples, to perpetuate the history and the traditions of the conquered ones. Whatever the Spaniards destroyed was not comparable with what they contributed with in terms of culture.''| [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rojas Mix |first=Miguel |date=1991 |title=Los cien nombres de América: eso que descubrió Colón |url= |location= |publisher=Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica |page=186 |isbn=84-264-1209-2 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hispanistas==
The ranks of notable supporters of hispanismo include Chilean historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]], who rejected liberal historiography in favor of [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] hispanismo.&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;{{Cite journal| url   = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-656.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was a state agency in Florida that participated in the restoration and preservation of St. Augustine, Florida from 1959-1997.
== Overview ==
[[File:HSAPB logo.jpg|thumb|HSAPB logo]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board (HSAPB) was a seven-member state commission, created by [[LeRoy Collins|Governor LeRoy Collins]] in 1959 "to acquire, restore, preserve, maintain, reconstruct, reproduce, and operate" historic structures in the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. The HSAPB set out to restore and reconstruct Spanish colonial era buildings in a focused area of downtown St. Augustine in anticipation of the city's Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965, and maintained a research library of documentary evidence to support their preservation and interpretation efforts. The HSAPB was sundowned by the ''State of Florida'' in June 1997.

== St. Augustine Restoration and Preservation Commission ==
In March 1958, a group from St. Augustine made a presentation to Governor LeRoy Collins to propose a [[historic preservation]] program for the city’s historic downtown. House Bill 774 was signed into law on June 11, 1959, establishing the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1959/vol1/FlaStat1959v1OCR_Part24.pdf|title=Florida Statutes, 1959, Chapter 266: St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1959|website=Florida State University College of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill also granted $150,000 of state funds to begin their work. The primary objective of their program was to recreate [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish colonial architecture]] and culture of St. Augustine during the period of 1565 to 1821 in advance of the city’s Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965. The buildings restored and reconstructed represent structures of the [[History of Florida|First Spanish Period]] (to 1763), British Period (1763-83), Second Spanish Period (1783-1821, and the early American Period (after 1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Division of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=5-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the Commission included H.E. Wolfe, Leonard Usina, William F. Rolleston, William L. Sims, II, and Henrietta Poynter. Wolfe, a resident of St. Augustine, was the Commission’s first chairman. The Commission hired consultant Earle Newton to help them develop a strategic plan for restoration and preservation, and soon began historical and archaeological research for the properties they proposed to restore.

The Commission’s first restoration project was the Arrivas House on St. George Street. Then-Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited St. Augustine on March 11, 1963 to dedicate the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Big Day in St. Augustine|last=|first=|date=March 12, 1963|work=The Florida Times-Union|access-date=|location=Jacksonville, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission used the second floor of the Arrivas House as their administrative offices until 1970, when they moved operations to [[Government House (St. Augustine)|Government House]].

== San Agustín Antiguo ==
The Commission opened a [[Living museum|living history museum village]] in its restored area in 1963, calling it San Agustín Antiguo. Costumed interpreters gave tours of restored buildings and demonstrated a variety of arts and crafts typical of the First and Second Spanish Periods, as well as of the British Period. These included [[Blacksmithing|blacksmithing,]] [[weaving]], [[printing]], [[History of candle making|candle dipping]], [[silversmithing]], [[pottery]], [[baking]], and [[Leather|leather making]]. Today a portion of the original museum village still demonstrates early Spanish life in St. Augustine at the [[Colonial Quarter]].

== Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board ==
On May 5, 1970, the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission was renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, enacted by Florida Statute Section 266.01-07.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1970/vsupp/FlaStat1970Supp_OCR_Part4.pdf|title=Florida Statutes 1970, Chapter 266.01: Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board of Trustees, creation.|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1970|website=Florida State University School of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board continued to fulfill their mission until 1997.

== Sundown and Aftermath ==
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was abolished by the State of Florida in June 1997 in accordance with the [[Sunset provision|Sundown Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=preservation+board&amp;URL=Ch0267/Sec171.HTM|title=Florida Statute Title XVII, Chapter 267.171|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=|website=Online Sunshine: The Official Internet Site of the Florida Legislature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the City of St. Augustine took over management of the historic properties. Today, the legacy of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board lives on through [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc.]] (UFHSA), a direct support organization of the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staugustine.ufl.edu/governance.html|title=UF Historic St. Augustine Governance|last=|first=|date=10/25/2018|website=UF Historic St. Augustine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/13/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the properties restored or reconstructed by the Board are owned by the State of Florida and managed by UFHSA on its behalf. The remaining records and research materials of the Board are held at Governor’s House Library in Government House Cultural Center and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/govhouse/Index.aspx|title=Governor's House Library|last=University of Florida|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historiometry''' is the historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, using statistics to analyze [[reference]]s to [[genius]]es,&lt;ref name=Simonton2008/&gt; their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts. Historiometry combines techniques from [[cliometrics]], which studies the history of economics and from [[psychometrics]], the [[psychology|psychological]] study of an individual's [[personality psychology|personality]] and abilities.

==Origins==
Historiometry started in the early 19th century with studies on the relationship between age and achievement by [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] [[mathematician]] [[Adolphe Quetelet]] in the careers of prominent French and English playwrights &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Historiometry is defined by Dean Keith Simonton as: a quantitative method of statistical analysis for [[retrospective]] data. In Simonton's work the [[raw data]] comes from [[psychometric]] assessment of famous personalities, often already deceased, in an attempt to assess [[creativity]], [[genius]] and [[talent development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Charles Murray's ''[[Human Accomplishment]]'' is one example of this approach to quantify the impact of individuals on [[technology]], science and the arts. This work tracks many famous innovators in these areas, and quantifies how much attention to them has been paid by past historians, in terms of the number of references and the number of pages of reference material devoted to each subject. However, this work has been criticized for manipulating its data to derive conclusions that would not follow from unmanipulated data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Book Review: Human Accomplishment, by Charles Murray|journal=Tech Law Journal|date=November 20, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of research==
Since historiometry deals with subjective personal traits as [[creativity]], [[charisma]] or [[Five factor model#Openness to experience|openness]] most studies deal with the comparison of scientists, artists or politicians. The study (''[[Human Accomplishment]]'') by Charles Murray classifies, for example, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] as the most important [[physicist]]s and [[Michelangelo]] as the top ranking western artist.&lt;ref name="Human Accomplishment"/&gt; As another example, several studies have compared charisma and even the IQ of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Her strategy of repertoire selection was guided by extremely traditionalistic tendencies.

==Critique==
Since historiometry is based on indirect information like historic documents and relies heavily on statistics, the results of these studies are questioned by some researchers, mainly because of concerns about ''over-interpretation'' of the estimated results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Industrial Revolution''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from [[craft production|hand production methods]] to [[machine]]s, new [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|iron production]] processes, the increasing use of [[steam power]], the development of [[machine tool]]s and the rise of the [[factory system]].

[[Textile]]s were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and [[capital (economics)|capital]] invested.

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"/&gt;

Although the [[structural change]] from agriculture to industry is widely associated with Industrial Revolution, in United Kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Keibek |first=Sebastiaan A.J. |date=2016 |title=The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850 |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and [[social change]]s.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lorenzen"/&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; while [[T.

[[Textile industry|Mechanized textile production]] spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging [[#Belgium|in Belgium]] and the United States and later textiles in France.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, [[Hot blast|hot blast iron smelting]] and new technologies, such as the [[electrical telegraph]], widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.&lt;ref  name="David S.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the term "Industrial Revolution" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [[Louis-Guillaume Otto]], announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.&lt;ref name="The industrial revolution in national context: Europe and the USA"/&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for "Industry": "The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the [19th] century." The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]]'s description in 1837 of ''la révolution industrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;BLANQUI Jérôme-Adolphe, ''Histoire de l'économie politique en Europe depuis les anciens jusqu'à nos jours'', 1837, {{ISBN|978-0-543-94762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution13"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]], have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term ''revolution'' is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians.

==Important technological developments==
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Innovations"/&gt; beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:
* '''Textiles''' – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [[power loom]] increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cotton gin]] increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;!--[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[James Watt]] improved on [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s 1712 steam engine with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1781]]--&gt;
* '''Steam power''' – the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.
* '''Iron making''' – the substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of [[pig iron]] and [[wrought iron]] production.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|89–93}}  Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1= Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Pres|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[economies of scale]].  The steam engine began being used to pump water to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [[blast furnace]] temperatures.  The [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [[finery forge]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969 91"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [[Hot blast]] (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.
* '''Invention of machine tools''' – The first [[machine tools]] were invented.  These included the [[screw cutting lathe]], cylinder boring machine and the [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]].   Machine tools made the economical manufacture of [[Interchangeable parts|precision metal parts]] possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Textile manufacture===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

====British textile industry statistics====
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization and Society|last=Hopkins|first=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

Wages in [[Lancashire]], a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in India in 1770, when overall [[productivity]] in Britain was about three times higher than in India.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Cotton====
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing [[cotton]] textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Trade and textiles====
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution, imposed upon modern political boundaries.]]

The [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Pre-mechanized European textile production====
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.  Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The [[Moors]] in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014" /&gt;

British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of Britain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton Textiles and the  Great Divergence: Lancashire, India and Shifting Competitive  Advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed [[Calico Acts]] in order to [[Protectionism|protect]] the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;

The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around [[Lancashire]] that produced [[fustian]], a cloth with flax [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and cotton [[weft]].  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the [[putting-out system]].  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the [[spinning wheel]], it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|823}}

====Invention of textile machinery====
The [[flying shuttle]], patented in 1733 by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|821–22}}

[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].
[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ray Gehani (1998). "Management of Technology and Operations". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|825–27}}

The [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|827–30}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]

[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|Interior of Marshall's [[Temple Works]]]]

Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

These advances were capitalised on by [[entrepreneur]]s, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (1986). "The Transformation of Britain, 1830–1939". p. 25. Routledge, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Wool====
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name=David_Landes_1999/&gt;

====Silk====
[[File:Silkmill1.jpg|thumb|Lombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [[Derby Silk Mill]]]]
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

===Iron industry===
[[File:Reverberatory furnace diagram.png|thumb|right|The [[reverberatory furnace]] could produce [[cast iron]] using mined coal. The burning coal remained separate from the iron and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and silica. This opened the way to increased iron production.]]

====UK iron production statistics====
Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.

In  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

====Iron process innovations====
A major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= American Iron 1607–1900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}  By 1750 [[coke (fuel)|coke]] had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in making glass.  In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|122–125}} A minority of coals are coking.

Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

Use of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)

By 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}

Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder. (August 19, 2018 - 10:00 ET)[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1808/19/fzgps.01.html Fareed Zakaria - GPS]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].&lt;ref name="Iron bridge"/&gt;  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].

Europe relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.

[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
 
The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute|url={{Google books|_tijGo0WWHMC|page=PA20|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1879|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.

[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics

Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.

===Steam power===
{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its "brand name", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.

The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]

A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton &amp; Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.

By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.

Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

The development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine tools===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]

Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen – [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.

The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.

Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|392–95}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|31, 36}}

Maudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.&lt;ref name="faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu"&gt;Economics 323–2: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
The large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52"/&gt; and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''
the co-evolution of firms, technology, and national institutions ''(2003) pp&amp;nbsp;53–54''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cement===
[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).&lt;br /&gt;[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]
In 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|°C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt; Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.

===Gas lighting===
{{Main|Gas lighting}}
Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton &amp; Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.

===Glass making===
{{Main|Glass production}}
[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]
A new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.

===Paper machine===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-Léger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.

The method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Industrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [[Swing Riots]].

[[Machine tools]] and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Mining===
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[South Wales]], started early. Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].

Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}
{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe's 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history's view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Canals and improved waterways====
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
[[File:Barton-on-Irwell 11.05.02R.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Bridgewater Canal]], famous because of its commercial success, crossing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], one of the last canals to be built.]]

Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]s.  Britain had over 1000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China, "the world's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence," parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is {{convert|1121|mi|0|abbr=out}} long and links [[Hangzhou]] with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Langmead|title=Encyclopedia of Architectural and Engineering Feats|url={{Google books|T5J6GKvGbmMC|page=PA37|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-112-0|page=37|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[North West England]], which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].  From [[Worsley]] to the rapidly growing town of [[Manchester]] its construction cost £168,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|2013|r=-1}}}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1860|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] and the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.

By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which upon opening in 1894 was the largest [[ship canal]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |quote=Six years in the making, the world's largest navigation canal gives the city direct access to the sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened Manchester as a [[Port of Manchester|port]]. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[Toll road|turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and most notably [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]], with the first '[[macadam]]ised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown (1991). "Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850" p. 136. Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of [[Packhorse|pack horse]]. Stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [[Un-sprung cart|carriers carts]].

====Railways====

[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830, the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned [[Railway Mania]] due to its success.]]

Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] after 1800, the [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]

Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].

On 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Sussman (2009). "Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].

Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

Other developments included more efficient [[water wheel]]s, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [[John Smeaton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Social effects==
{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}

===Factory system===
{{Main|Factory system}}
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;	Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])

The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Standards of living===
Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&amp;nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt; Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625–58|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szreter &amp; Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. Real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küchenhoff |first1=Helmut |date=2012 |title=The Diminution of Physical Stature of the British Male Population in the 18th-Century |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/afc/cliome/v6y2012i1p45-62.html |journal=Cliometrica |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=45–62 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snowdon |first1=Brian |date=April–June 2005 |title=Measures of Progress and Other Tall Stories: From Income to Anthropometrics |url=https://www.worldeconomics.com/Journal/Papers/Measures%20of%20Progress%20and%20Other%20Tall%20Stories.details?ID=209 |journal=World Economics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–136 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;

The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.&lt;ref name="Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="econlib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwell"/&gt;

====Food and nutrition====
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the [[Antebellum Puzzle]].&lt;ref name="The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100"/&gt;

Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].

The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2000"/&gt; In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Housing====
The very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory  Clark,  "Shelter from the storm: housing and the industrial revolution, 1550–1909." ''Journal of Economic History'' 62#2 (2002): 489–511.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11 (1968): 641–90.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825462 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Powell, ''The British building industry since 1800: An economic history'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kemp, "Housing landlordism in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Environment and Planning A'' 14.11 (1982): 1437–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. [[Cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The Slums of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11.1 (1967): 5–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825891 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S. Wohl, ''The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Daunton, ''House and home in the Victorian city: working-class housing, 1850–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.

Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].

====Sanitation====
In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.

In 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.

====Water supply====
Pre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"/&gt;

====Increase in literacy====
The invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

===Clothing and consumer goods===
[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]
Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Population increase===
The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.
|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-7131-6531-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt; compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).&lt;ref name="prb6"/&gt; Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="britannica7"/&gt;

===Impact on women and family life===
Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was "voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"/&gt;

====Factories and urbanisation====
{{Main|Factory system}}
[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]

Industrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed "[[Cottonopolis]]", and the world's first industrial city.&lt;ref name="Industrial city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester – the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/industrial_revolution_towns.htm|title=Life in Industrial Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of Europe's population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.

For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

In other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

By 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

====Child labour====
{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.&lt;ref name="From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life"/&gt; In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation"/&gt; There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref name="galbithink"/&gt;

[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,&lt;ref name="victorianweb"/&gt; 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children as young as four were employed.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt;

Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines&lt;ref name="Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission"/&gt; and textile factories,&lt;ref name="The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England"/&gt; and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

====Organisation of labour====
{{See also|Trade union#History}}
The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as "the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.

Working people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.

Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;

Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

====Luddites====
{{Main|Luddite}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]

The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.

Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.

====Shift in production's center of gravity====
The traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

The Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.

====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====
Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

The Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert

===Impact on environment===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
The origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie  Tomory, "The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812–1830." ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. Tarr,  "Toxic Legacy: The Environmental Impact of the Manufactured Gas Industry in the United States." ''Technology and culture'' 55#1 (2014): 107–47. [http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=history online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==

===Continental Europe===
The Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

====Belgium====

[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref name="publishing"/&gt;

Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word "houille" was coined in Wallonia),&lt;ref name="language"/&gt; the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.&lt;ref name="ugent"/&gt; Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain."&lt;ref name="philippe"/&gt; "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]]."&lt;ref name="erih"/&gt; Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Liège|Université de Liège]] wrote also: "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." &lt;ref name="linguistiques"/&gt;

=====Demographic effects=====
Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] [...] Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.&lt;ref name="stereotypes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====France====
{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.&lt;ref name="marczewski" /&gt; Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer:
* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),
* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),
* economic slowdown (1860–1905),
* renewal of the growth after 1905.

====Germany====
{{main|Economic history of Germany}}

Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.

During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.

During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.

During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.

===Japan===
{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the [[cotton gin]] and the development of a system for making [[interchangeable parts]], the latter aided by the development of the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.

[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.

[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,&lt;ref name="manufacturers"/&gt; and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.&lt;ref name="publication"/&gt;

In 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768–1835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.&lt;ref name="britannica8"/&gt; [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of "America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.

[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.

A major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].  The Blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanized the shoe industry.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"&gt;{{cite book

The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
&lt;!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.--&gt;    
[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men, Machines and Modern Times"/&gt;  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [[open hearth furnace]] near the end of the 19th century.

This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the [[automotive industry]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.

The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

A new revolution began with electricity and [[electrification]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industries]]. The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England"/&gt; The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=13–16|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.&lt;ref name="industrial10"/&gt; However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="association"/&gt;

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the [[Early Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates.&lt;ref name="Technics &amp; Civilization"/&gt; He explains that the model for standardised [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.&lt;ref name="google11"/&gt; Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia until 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.

Governments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.&lt;ref name="industrialisation"/&gt; Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.&lt;ref name="dklevine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mott-smith"/&gt;

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]&lt;ref name="j-bradford-delong"/&gt; or the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="historyguide"/&gt; A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=Pier|date=2001|title=Are Coal and Colonies Really Crucial?|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes&lt;ref name="google12"/&gt; (see [[scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Causes"/&gt;

China was the world's most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern estimates of per capita income in Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in [[purchasing power parity]] (and Britain had a [[per capita income]] of nearly 2,000 dollars&lt;ref name="iisg"/&gt;) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars.

Historians such as [[David Landes]] and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|pages=20–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christianity]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Fei]]zi ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]), resulting in very different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merson|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the considerable distance of China's coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable [[Yellow River]] that connects these deposits to the sea.&lt;ref name="professor"/&gt;

Regarding India, the Marxist historian [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] said: "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain."&lt;ref name="india_resource"/&gt; In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], with the major ones in its aftermath including the [[Maratha]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Bengal Subah]], and [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India by providing "an insurance against economic and technological stagnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|last=Jones|first=Eric|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

In addition, Europe's monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state.

===Causes in Britain===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|upright=1.35|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies.]]

Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled [[entrepreneur]]s to pioneer the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution," ''Journal of British Studies'' (April 2011) 50#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;307–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=24%|align=left|quote="An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself." |source = – British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] on the BBC's ''Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here''.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|332}}

There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an [[entrepreneurial]] spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;Kiely, Ray (November 2011). "Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis". UGL Press Limited: 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History"/&gt; Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution by Pat Hudson, pg. 198"/&gt;
[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[William Bell Scott]] ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60]]

Instead, the greater [[liberalisation]] of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name="manufacturing"/&gt;). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="dictatorship"/&gt; (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)

The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. "Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

Britain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.

In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.&lt;ref name="continuity"/&gt;

Economic historian [[Robert C. Allen|Robert Allen]] has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, two 2018 studies in ''[[The Economic History Review]]'' showed that wages were not particularly high in the British [[Spinning wheel|spinning]] sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on Allen's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Jane|last2=Schneider|first2=Benjamin|date=2018-05-23|title=Spinning the industrial revolution|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|doi=10.1111/ehr.12693|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Judy Z.|date=2017-05-13|title='Real' wages?

===Transfer of knowledge===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]
Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

====Protestant work ethic====
{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.&lt;ref name="Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation"/&gt; The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

==Opposition from Romanticism==
{{Main|Romanticism}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to "monstrous" machines and factories; the "Dark satanic mills" of Blake's poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]". [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.&lt;ref&gt;AJ George, ''The development of French romanticism: the impact of the industrial revolution on literature'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="manufacturing"&gt;The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain's industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Democracy}}

This is an incomplete list of wars between entities that have a [[constitution]]ally [[democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]] and actually practice it. Two points are required: that there has been a war, and that there are democracies on at least two opposing sides. For many of these entries, whether there has been a war, or a democracy, is a debatable question; all significant views should be given. For example, see [[list of types of democracy]].

==Definition dependence==
:''See also: [[List of types of democracy]], [[History of democracy]],  and [[Democratic peace theory]].''
Almost all of these depend on the definition of "democracy" (and of "war") employed. As James Lee Ray points out, with a sufficiently restrictive definition of democracy, there will be no wars between democracies: define democracy as true universal suffrage, the right of all – including children – to vote, and there have been no democracies, and so no wars between them.

On the other hand, Ray lists the following as having been called wars between democracies,  with broader definitions of democracy: The [[American Revolution]] including the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Belgian Revolution]], the [[Sonderbund War]], the war of 1849 between the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] and the [[Second French Republic]], the [[American Civil War]], the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[Second Philippine War]], the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] (as a whole, and also the [[Continuation War]] by itself), the [[Israeli War of Independence]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]–1948, the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lee Ray: "Wars between democracies: Rare, or nonexistent?", ''International Interactions'' Volume 18, Issue 3 February 1993, pages 251–276; child suffrage and  from Ray, ''Democracy and International Conflict'' p.88. Restricted definitions of democracy can also be constructed which define away all wars between democracies, and yet include many regimes often held to be democratic; Ray finds this more rhetorically effective than saying that ''full-scale'' international war between ''established'' democracies with ''wide'' suffrage is less likely than between other pairs of states.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes also had democratic forms of government, and they often fought each other up until the late 19th century, as did many tribes of [[Norsemen]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Similarly, the school of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], founder of the [[Polity IV]] dataset, divides regimes into three classes: democracies, autocracies, and "[[Anocracy|anocracies]]"; the last being the sort of weak or new states which are marginal democracies or marginal autocracies; many of the wars below involve weak or marginal democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ze'ev Maoz, Nasrin Abdolali, "Regime Types and International Conflict, 1816–1976", ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''  vol. 33, no. 1 (March 1986) pp. 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early democracy==

===Greek democracies===
{{See also|Athenian democracy}}
The [[Peloponnesian war]] included a great many conflicts among Greek city-states. The principal war was between Athens and her allies (most of them democracies) on one side, and Sparta and her allies (most of them oligarchies—although most of them held elections among a citizen body{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}) on the other. But the war lasted for twenty-seven years, with a brief armistice, and a great many side-conflicts occurred; and states changed from democracy to oligarchy and back again. Most notable of the wars between democracies was the [[Sicilian Expedition]], 415–413 BC, in which Athens went to war with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Bruce Russett]] finds 13 conflicts between "clear" democratic pairs (most of these being Athens and allies in the Sicilian Expedition) and 25 involving "other" democratic pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Russett, ''Grasping the Democratic Peace'', p. 47–71; Russett, one of the few to consider the democratic peace before 1750, thinks it likely that the norm of interdemocratic peace developed gradually through the centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; Classicist [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] thinks one of Russett's examples unlikely, but adds several instances of wars between democracies before and after the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen ''et al.'': ''An inventory of archaic and classical poleis'' (2005), p. 85 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Republic===
{{See also|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The constitution of the [[Roman Republic]], before its collapse in the late 1st century BC, is amply documented; its magistrates (including the [[Roman Senate]], which was composed of current and former magistrates) were elected by universal suffrage by adult (male) citizens; all male citizens were eligible. There was a political class of wealthy men; most successful candidates belonged to this class, and all of them were supported by a party drawn from it, but this does not distinguish Rome from other democracies—nor, indeed, from non-democratic states; freedom of speech was, however, a characteristic difference between the Republic and the later [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Roman Revolution'' (1939, repr. and revised 1962), including the view on the oligarchy behind ''all'' constitutions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;David Churchman, ''Why We Fight: Theories of Aggression and Human Conflict'', University Press of America (2005), p.143, who discusses Rome ''and'' Carthage.&lt;/ref&gt; The old constitution of Carthage, before the [[First Punic War]], was described by Aristotle as a mixture of democracy and oligarchy; after the disastrous end of that war, about 240&amp;nbsp;BC, there was a democratic change, the direct election of a pair of executives, and the [[Second Punic War]] was fought under that constitution; there continued to be an oligarchic party.  There were several further changes of party, and democratic reforms; the election of the democratic party, which favored a less passive foreign policy, in 151&amp;nbsp;BC provoked Rome to begin the [[Third Punic War]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel: ''History of Carthage'' (1993, Eng. tr. 1995) pp. 116–120, 411; Richard Miles ''"Carthage must be destroyed"'' (2010): 214, 318, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
* The [[Quasi War]]*, a naval conflict from 1798 to 1800 between the United States and the French Republic. Neither side declared war.

==19th century==
* [[War of 1812]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Russett, ''Controlling the Sword: the Democratic Governance of National Security'' (1990), p.123; George Modelski, "Is America's Decline Inevitable?" ''The Bridge'' 19:2, pp. 11–18, (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mexican–American War]]&lt;ref&gt;Reiter, D. and Stam, A.C., ''Democracies at War''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sonderbund War]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated51"&gt;John Mueller, "Is War Still Becoming Obsolete?" paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Washington, DC, August–September 1991, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Siege of Rome (1849)|War of 1849]] between the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] and the [[French Second Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;Small, Melvin; Singer, David J. (1976). "The War Proneness of Democratic Regimes, 1816–1965". ''Jerusalem Journal of International Relations'' 1: 50–69; Bruce Russett, ''Controlling the Sword: the Democratic Governance of National Security'' (1990), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Civil War]], the United States was a republic and the Confederate States was nominally a republic as well
* [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857–1860|War of 1859]] between [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, David E. (1994). "Give Democratic Peace a Chance? The Insignificance of the Liberal Peace". ''International Security'', Vol. 19, No. 2. (Autumn, 1994): 50–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spanish–American War]]&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Gowa, ''Ballots and Bullets: the Elusive Democratic Peace'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Russett, ''Controlling the Sword: the Democratic Governance of National Security'' (1990), p.123; on the [[Orange Free State]] as direct democracy, see also ''The Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics'' 2:74; in general, see  Dean V.  Babst. "Elective Governments — A Force For Peace." ''The Wisconsin Sociologist'' 3 (1, 1964): 9–14 (he writes of, and defines, ''freely elective governments'', but his papers have been taken as the founding of democratic peace theory, and cited as being about democracies); Raymond Cohen, "Pacific unions: a reappraisal of the theory that 'democracies do not go to war with each other'", ''Review of International Studies'' 20 (3, 1994) 207–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
* [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13): The [[Young Turks]] had re-established constitutional government in Ottoman Turkey in 1908, and continued to struggle for greater liberalization;&lt;ref&gt;Ayhat Kansu, ''Politics in post-revolutionary Turkey, 1908-1913'', passim&lt;/ref&gt; the "relatively democratic" Constitution of Serbia had been restored in 1903, and attained complete openness of executive recruitment. Serbia and its allies, the constitutional monarchies of Greece and Bulgaria, won the war; Turkey suffered a military coup as a result of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 210-11, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First World War]]: The Polity IV dataset does not rank any of the [[Central Powers]] as democracies, although the component of democracy for Germany had been higher than that of autocracy since the 1890s, when Bismarck was replaced by [[Leo von Caprivi]];&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; neither does the somewhat controversial&lt;ref&gt;Vanhanen calls his own methodology of ranking democracies approximate, and subject to short-term variation; others call it "unacceptable", and using "invalid" or "controversial" indicators; see Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p. 36,61. He primarily uses it to measure and compare long-term trends in the democracy of single countries, in which such fluctuations will cancel out.&lt;/ref&gt; ranking of [[Tatu Vanhanen]];&lt;ref&gt;Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p72&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, all of the Central Powers had elected parliaments; the Reichstag had been elected by universal suffrage, and voted on whether a credit essential to the German conduct of the war should be granted. Whether this is democratic control over the foreign policy of the Kaiser is "a difficult case"; [[Michael W. Doyle]] concludes, however, that the government was not absolutely dependent on the Reichstag - and that Germany was a [[dyarchy]], effectively a mixture of two different constitutions, and democratic on internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael W. (1983a). "Kant, Liberal Legacies, and Foreign Affairs". Philosophy and Public Affairs 12 (Vol. 12, No. 3. (Summer, 1983)): p216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Queen of Scots reenactor.jpg|right|thumb|A reenactress playing the role of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] at a Scottish fair in 2003.]]

'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0703-021, Schwerin, Indianistiktreffen.jpg|thumb|Eastern German Living history at an "Indianistikmeeting" 1982 in [[Schwerin]]]]
[[File:Guédelon - mai 2014 - 24.JPG|thumb|The [[Guédelon Castle]] in France is a castle currently built using only medieval construction techniques, tools, costumes and local materials.]]
Living history approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),&lt;ref Name="Ban"&gt;Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem Häkelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer Überblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, Köln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beiträgen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander Häusler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt;

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Landshut Wedding]] or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt; started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: 2008, S. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Borries, Jens-Uwe Fischer: ''Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/ Main 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
That sort of 'second hand' living history&lt;ref name=gf&gt;Volkskultur aus fremder Hand - Indianer- und Westernhobby in Deutschland zwischen Amerikanisierung, " Anti-Imperialismus" und popularisierter Ethnologie, doctorate Albert - Ludwigs - Universität zu Freiburg i. Br, Gabriele Wilczek 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is as well part of western Germany folklore and tries for a high level of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/zu-besuch-bei-deutschen-indianern/a-16716293 Zu Besuch bei deutschen "Indianern"] Deutsche Welle 07.05.2013, Ananda Grade&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
[[File:Vikingtent.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Viking encampment.]]

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In education==
[[File:Highlander-actor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A reenactor from a living history group.]]
[[File:Lincoln living.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Abraham Lincoln in present time.]]
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  “Interpreters” are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual’s personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered “folk artifacts,” which are grouped under the heading of “material culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Experiential learning]], "About"&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], “That the Future May Learn from the Past,” proclaims the site’s commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled “Applied History,” in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.&lt;ref&gt;James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by the 19th-century [[England|English]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]. Traditional English fairytales depicting [[elves]], [[fairy|fairies]] and [[pixie]]s are set on a "Merrie England" setting of woodland and cottage gardens.]]

"'''Merry England'''", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "'''Merrie England'''" (also styled as "'''Merrie Olde England'''"), refers to an [[England|English]] [[autostereotype]], a [[utopia]]n conception of [[English culture|English society and culture]] based on an [[idyll]]ic [[pastoral]] way of life that was allegedly prevalent in [[Early Modern Britain]] at some time between the [[Middle Ages]] and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. More broadly, it connotes a putative [[essentialism|essential]] [[Englishness]] with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such [[cultural icon|cultural symbols]] as the [[thatched cottage]], the [[country inn]] and the [[Sunday roast]].

"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which [[Oxford]] [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" ''Folklore'' '''102'''.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental [[nostalgic]] imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of ''Merry England'' originated in the Middle Ages, when [[Henry of Huntingdon]] around 1150 first coined the phrase ''Anglia plena jocis''.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], who claimed that "England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Ronald Hutton]]'s study of churchwardens' accounts&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700''.&lt;/ref&gt; places the real consolidation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, [[boy bishop]]s and decorated [[rood loft]]s. Hutton argued that, far from being [[Paganism|pagan survivals]], many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: "Merry England" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hodgkinson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/17/merryenglandwasrealenough 17 November 2006] - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The same concept ''may'' have also been used to describe a [[utopia]]n state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see [[Cockaigne]]).{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} Peasant revolts, such as those led by [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]] invoked a [[visionary]] idea that was also [[egalitarian]] – [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] arguing for "wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. B. Bury ed, ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term "[[Norman yoke]]" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom.  The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – [[Lawrence Stone]] describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (London 1979) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''Th stripping of the Altars'' (London 1992) p. 42;L. Marcus, ''The Politic of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game”&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 95, p. 192 and p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. [[William Langland|Langland]] might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a ''Hey-nonny-nonny''”.&lt;ref&gt;J. F Goodridge ed., ''Piers the Ploughman'' (Penguin 1966) p. 41 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The wandering scholar, or [[goliard]], who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose,&lt;ref&gt;H. Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking,&lt;ref&gt;D. Baker ed., ''The Early Middle Ages'' (London 1966) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Berners, quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, [[mummers]], morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers,&lt;ref&gt;S Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (London 2005) pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly ''merriment'' in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the [[Black Death]] when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and [[serfdom]] was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''History of England'' (London 1926) pp. 242, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the "lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days",&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Alatars'' (London 1992) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, ''1599'' (London 2005) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400–1700'' (Oxford 1994) Ch II. For methodological criticism, see however Katherine L. French, ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1995), 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and including such customs as [[Parish ale|church ales]], may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

However a reaction quickly set in, [[John Caius]] in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called "the old world, when this country was called merry England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; James I in 1618 issued his [[Book of Sports]], specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service;&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of "Merry England" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War.  Unsurprisingly, the [[Long Parliament]] put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove [[Christmas]] underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural revivals==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Gate of Calais|O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais)]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] contrasts English plenty with French and Jacobite Highlander misery.]]

At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving illustrating the patriotic song "[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]" (''see illustration''), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

[[William Hazlitt]]'s essay "Merry England", appended to his ''Lectures on the English Comic Writers'' (1819),&lt;ref&gt;It was often reprinted in collections of Hazlitt's essays, and, tellingly, included in Ernest Rhys' compilation of sentimental patriotism ''The Old Country: a Book of  Love and Praise of England'', first published in  1917, as the First World War was coming to an end, and republished in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an [[allusion]] to the iconic figure of [[Robin Hood]], under the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] "St George for merry England!":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of [[Sherwood Forest|'Merry Sherwood']], and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to ''Merry England''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England'' (1844: translated as ''The Condition of the Working Class in England''), [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote sarcastically of [[Young England]] (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore "the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ..."  The phrase "merry England" appears in English in the German text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_486.htm|title=Friedrich Engels - Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England - Die Stellung der Bourgeoisie zum Proletariat|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CRANE a garland for mayday 1895.jpg|thumb|left|"A Garland for May Day 1895" woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

[[William Cobbett]] provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and ''mores'' of an industrialising nation&lt;ref&gt;William Sambrook, ''William Cobbett'' (1973), ch. I "Merry England?"&lt;/ref&gt; by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] also subscribed to some extent to the "Merry England" view. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' by [[Thomas Love Peacock]]  contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social  unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. "Hurrah for Merry England", was set twice to music and printed in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the [[Gothic revival]] promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—"Norman" for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], "[[Early English Period|Early English]]", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically ''English'' style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named "[[Jacobethan]]". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by [[Joseph Nash]] (1839–1849), illustrating ''The Mansions of England in the Olden Time'' in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and [[farthingale]]s, who personified a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.

Children's storybooks and [[fairytales]] written in the [[Victorian period]] often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as [[elves]] and [[fairy|fairies]], as well as [[Robin Hood]]. In popular culture, the adjective ''Dickensian'' is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but [[Charles Dickens]]'s view of the rural past evoked [[nostalgia]], not [[fantasy]]. [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]]'s world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the [[stagecoach]] before the advent of the [[railway]]s.

The London-based [[Anglo-Catholic]] magazine of prose and verse ''Merry England'' began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by [[William Wordsworth]] as epigraph, beginning "They called thee 'merry England' in old time" and characterizing ''Merry England'' "a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief":
&lt;poem&gt;
'''...Can, I ask,'''
    This face of rural beauty be a mask
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime?—
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?—
    Forbid it, Heaven! —that Merry England still
    May be they rightful name, in prose or rhyme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late Victorian era, the Tory [[Young England]] set perhaps best reflected the vision of "Merry England" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to [[political conservatism]], the vision of "Merry England" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane [[clergy]]; an interested and [[altruism|altruistic]] [[Squire#Present status (England)|squirearchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[royal family|royalty]]. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of [[yeoman farmer]]s, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s and [[Catholicism]], as a version of life's generosity; for example [[Alice Meynell|Wilfrid Meynell]] entitled one of his magazines ''Merrie England''. The pastoral aspects of [[William Blake]], a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. [[G. K. Chesterton]] in part adapted it to urban conditions. [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and other left-inclined improvers. [[Walter Crane]]'s "Garland for May Day 1895"  is lettered "Merrie England" together with progressive slogans ("Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life", "The Land for the People", "No Child Toilers") with socialism ("Production for Use Not for Profit"). For a time, the ''Merry England'' vision was a common reference point for rhetorical [[Tories]] and utopian [[socialist]]s, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross [[social inequality]].
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the ''Clarion'', in his booklet ''Merrie England'' (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably {{what?|date=November 2018}} more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. 

Another variant of ''Merry England'' was promoted in the ''organic community'' of [[F. R. Leavis]] by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan R. R. (1979) ''The Literary Criticism if F. R. Leavis'' (Cambridge University Press) pages 14–18, {{ISBN|978-0-521-22324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve "this hard core of Merriment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.&lt;ref&gt;D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Little England'' and propaganda==

In Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding "[[Little Englander|Little England]]" during the [[Second World War]] in ''The Myth of the Blitz'', he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime [[propaganda]] operations within the [[United Kingdom]], and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster [[J. B. Priestley]] whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime [[BBC]] radio "chats" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in its [[London Underground|Underground]] stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars." (Angus Calder, ''The Myth of the Blitz'', London 1991)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in ''Journey Through England'', Priestley identified himself as a [[Little Englander]] because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song "[[There'll Always Be an England]]" seems to be derived from the same source:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a country lane,
:Wherever there's a cottage small
:Beside a field of grain.

The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a busy street,
:Wherever there's a turning wheel,
:A million marching feet.

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

Some of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalism]] which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology.  However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of ''Merry England'' to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet [[William Blake]] to the evangelical Christian [[Arthur Mee]]. The [[Rudyard Kipling]] of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. The 1890 [[News from Nowhere]] by [[William Morris]] portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Betjeman]] (more interested in [[Victoriana]]), and the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whose [[hobbit]] characters' culture in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]", [[Michael Moorcock]] opined:

{{quote|The little hills and woods of that [[Surrey]] of the mind, [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], are 'safe', but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond the Shire are 'dangerous'. Experience of life itself is dangerous. The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a declining nation with a [[morally bankrupt]] class whose cowardly self-protection is primarily responsible for the problems England answered with the ruthless logic of [[Thatcherism]]. Humanity was derided and marginalised. Sentimentality became the acceptable substitute. So few people seem to be able to tell the difference.}}

Here the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region within [[Middle-earth]], but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', both [[Gandalf]] and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in ''Concerning Hobbits'' the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness.  Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Furthermore, in the chapters "Homeward Bound" and "The Scouring of the Shire" of Tolkien's "The Return of the King" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as "This is worse than Mordor." Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where "The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture."

''[[The Pyrates]]'', the 1983 spoof historical novel by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]]:
{{quote|It began in the old and golden days of England, in a time when all the hedgerows were green and the roads dusty, when hawthorn and wild roses bloomed, when big-bellied landlords brewed October ale at a penny a pint ...}}

The novel ''[[England, England]]'' by [[Julian Barnes]] describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England.  The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's "Merrie England" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; [[The Kinks]] and their leader [[Ray Davies]] crafted ''[[The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as an album "lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions";&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11011|pure_url=yes}} ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'']. Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' also contains similar elements. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs ([[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the band's namesake]] was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' is a [[comic opera]] by [[Edward German]].

[[Richmal Crompton]]'s "William the Bad'" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch',  about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at "the morning of the world", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal.  The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say,  on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. "The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves [[St. George and the Dragon]] ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwilliamnotes.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Just William|author=Pip|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{creationism2}}

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him. Your life or mine is but a half-sentence in the book of the world. Tear it from its place, and it cannot be read; or if it can be read, it signifies nothing".&lt;ref name="Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite"&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/files/christchair/Hebblethwaite%20In%20Defence%20of%20Christianity.pdf Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], In Defence of Christianity March 6, 2005, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Brian Hebblethwaite]]|source=}}

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the Universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], an author whose works have been banned by several [[Haredi]] rabbis for going against the tenets of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Safran, [http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm "Gedolei Yisroel Condemn Rabbi Nosson Slifkin's Books"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229212121/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm |date=2007-12-29 }}. Dei'ah veDibur, January 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

{{quotation|God essentially created two conflicting accounts of Creation: one in nature, and one in the [[Torah]]. How can it be determined which is the real story, and which is the fake designed to mislead us? One could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story, and that the Torah was devised by God to test us with a fake history!

One has to be able to rely on God's truthfulness if religion is to function. Or, to put it another way—if God went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old, who are we to disagree?&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin, p167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Similar formulations==

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme [[philosophical skepticism]] with regard to memory.&lt;ref name=russell5&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Russell | first1 = Bertrand | authorlink1 = Bertrand Russell | title = Analysis of Mind | year = 1921 | publisher = G.

===Borges's ''Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius''===
[[Jorge Luis Borges]], in his 1940 work, ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', describes a fictional world in which some essentially follow as a religious belief a philosophy much like Russell's discussion on the [[logical extreme]] of Gosse's theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://interglacial.com/~sburke/pub/Borges_-_Tlon,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius.html#backto2 Borges - Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to prehistoric technology.

'''[[Prehistoric technology]]''' – [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records; it is also the record itself. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] (meaning "before history"), including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, cut food, and bury their dead.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Nature of prehistoric technology ==
{{Human timeline}}
Prehistoric technology can be described as:
* [[Prehistoric]] – "before we had written records," from the Latin word for "before," præ. Prehistory is the span of time before recorded history, that is, before the invention of writing systems.
* [[Technology]] – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function.

== Old World prehistoric technology ==
* [[Three-age system]] – in archaeology and physical anthropology, the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, each named after the main material used in its respective tool-making technologies: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.
* Beginning of prehistoric technology – the earliest technology began (2.5 million years) before recorded history, that is, at the beginning of the Stone Age.
* Latest prehistoric technology – the level of technology reached before true writing was introduced differed by region (and usually included proto-writing)...
** Latest prehistoric technology in the Near East – cultures in the Near East achieved the development of writing first, during their Bronze Age.
** Latest prehistoric technology in the rest of the Old World: Europe, India, and China reached Iron Age technological development before the introduction of writing there.

=== Stone Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Stone Age]] – broad prehistoric period, lasting roughly 2.5 million years, during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period began with hominids and ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.

==== Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Paleolithic]] – prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory.

==== Lower Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Lower Paleolithic]] – earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million years]] ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominids]] appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].
** [[Stone tools|Stone tool use]] – early human (hominid) use of stone tool technology, such as the [[hand axe]], was [[Tool use by animals|similar to that of primates]], which is found to be limited to the intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years. Ancestors of homo sapiens (modern man) used stone tools as follows:

=== End of prehistory and the beginning of history ===
* Development of true writing systems – in the Old World, true writing systems developed from [[neolithic]] writing in the [[Early Bronze Age]] ([[4th millennium BC]]).  The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic (pre-[[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]) writing and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest true writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]].

====Transition from proto-writing to true writing====
* General developmental stages leading from proto-writing to true writing:
** ''Picture writing system'': glyphs directly represent objects and ideas or objective and ideational situations. In connection with this the following substages may be distinguished:
**# The mnemonic: glyphs primarily a reminder;
**# The pictographic (pictography): glyphs represent directly an object or an objective situation such as (A) chronological, (B) notices, (C) communications, (D) totems, titles, and names, (E) religious, (F) customs, (G) historical, and (H) biographical;
**# The ideographic (ideography): glyphs represent directly an idea or an ideational situation.
** ''Transitional system'': glyphs refer not only to the object or idea which it represents but to its name as well.
** ''Phonetic system'': glyphs refer to sounds or spoken symbols irrespective of their meanings. This resolves itself into the following substages:
**# The verbal: glyph ([[logogram]]) represents a whole word;
**# The syllabic: glyph represent a syllable;
**# The alphabetic: glyph represent an elementary sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Molière]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953–72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;—is considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychoanalysis]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]], and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

==Description==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22). Psychohistory holds that ritual child sacrifice  once  occurred  in most cultures.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[parenting]] practice and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the roots of violence|year=1980|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780374522698}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistorians, on the other hand, suggest that social behavior such as [[crime]] and [[war]] may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and  social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===Areas of study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The history of childhood – which looks at such questions as:
::*How have children been raised throughout history
::*How has the family been constituted
::*How and why have practices changed over time
::*The changing place and value of children in society over time
::*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed
:2. [[Psychobiography]] – which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
:3. Group psychohistory – which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the [[Loaded language|loaded terms]], [[metaphor]]s and repetitive words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
{{OR-section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- Only one of the people Wikipedia articles linked in this section makes any use of the word "psychohistory" in its body. That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the "Tanka prose" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of "practitioners" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the "history" of the "discipline" of "psychohistory" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. --&gt;
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of "psycho-history" to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

Psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of modern psychohistorical research, which uses different methods.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
[[Lloyd deMause]] has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Joseph F.|year=2009|title=Psychohistory: Creating a New Discipline|url=|journal=Journal of Psychohistory|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.

The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsFoundations"&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132–146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

! Historical manifestations
|-
| rowspan="2" valign="top" | Infanticidal
| valign="top" | ''[[Early infanticidal childrearing]]:''&lt;br /&gt;Ritual sacrifice. High infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape and tortures.
| rowspan="2" | [[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies ("late" infanticidal childrearing).
|-
| valign="top" | ''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Infant exposure|exposed]] to death.
|-
| valign="top" | Abandoning
| valign="top" | Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name="EMOL" /&gt;
| valign="top" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].
|-
| valign="top" | Ambivalent
| valign="top" | The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.
| valign="top" | The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries.  early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].
|-
| valign="top" | Intrusive
| valign="top" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.
|-
| valign="top" | Socializing
| valign="top" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.
| valign="top" | Use of guilt, "mental discipline", [[humiliation]], [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | Helping
| valign="top" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than "[[socialize]]" them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | [[Children's rights movement]], [[natural childbirth]], the abandonment of [[circumcision]], [[attachment parenting]], [[Taking Children Seriously]], unconditional parenting, [[Parent Effectiveness Training]], [[deschooling]] and [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]].

Psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the "helping mode") are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.  An example of this are reports of [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Gettis, J. Getis, and J. D. Fellmann (2004). ''Introduction to Geography, Ninth Edition''. New York:  McGraw-Hill, pp. 200f.&lt;/ref&gt;  regions in which  millions of women are "missing".&lt;ref&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2584811 Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy]. ''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected in political contrasts – for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W. Bush's Second Term: Saving the World, Saving the Country | journal = [[Journal of Psychohistory]] | volume = 33 | pages = 117–124 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = deMause | first = Lloyd | title = [Book review of] Jonathan Schell's ''The Seventh Decade'' | journal = Journal of Psychohistory | volume = 35 | pages = 308–309 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and in civil wars.

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{cite book

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay "The Evolution of Childhood" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of "helping mode" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] – deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to "psychohistory" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, facing criticism in the academic community,&lt;ref name="OnWriting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367–388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics referring to it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies, and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance.

DeMause has received criticism on several levels. His formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = "Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective". In ''Past, Present and Personal: The Family and The Life Course in American History''  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1986  | location = NY  | pages = 68–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the "black legend" view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been called a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources, e.g. Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800''. However, deMause received criticism for his repeated, detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical "abuses." There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336–354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories are not representative of the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |author=Marc Comtois | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061651/http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html|archivedate=March 12, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Institute for Psychohistory'' was founded by [[Lloyd deMause]]. It has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. Also the ''International Psychohistorical Association'' was founded by Lloyd deMause (in 1977) as a professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. The association hosts an annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title= Conference and Membership |url= http://www.psychohistory.us/conference-and-membership.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Psychohistory Forum'', publishes the quarterly journal ''Clio’s Psyche''.  It was founded in 1983 by historian and psychoanalyst Paul H. Elovitz. This organization of academics, therapists, and laypeople holds regular scholarly meetings in New York City and at international conventions. It also sponsors an [http://groups.google.com/group/cliospsyche online discussion group].

In Germany, scientists taking an interest in psychohistory met annually since 1987. In 1992, the ''Gesellschaft für Psychohistorie und politische Psychologie e.V'' (“Society for Psychohistory and Political Psychology”) was founded. This society issues the ''Jahrbuch für Psychohistorische Forschung'' (“Annual of Psychohistorical Research”)

The '''Pulitzer Prize for History''', administered by [[Columbia University]], is one of the seven American [[Pulitzer Prizes]] that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It has been presented since 1917 for a distinguished book about the [[history of the United States]]. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1917 "1917 Winners"]. The Pulitzer Prizes (pulitzer.org). Retrieved 2013-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pulitzer Prize program has also recognized some historical work with its [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Biography prize]], from 1917, and its [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|General Non-Fiction prize]], from 1952.

Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner.&lt;ref name=prize/&gt;

==Winners==
In its first 97 years to 2013, the History Pulitzer was awarded 95 times. Two prizes were given in 1989; none in 1919, 1984, and 1994.&lt;ref name=prize/&gt; Four people have won two each, [[Margaret Leech]], [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Paul Horgan]] and [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]].

The '''Qing conquest theory''' is a theory proposed by Chinese academics that attempts to explain the [[Great Divergence]], the overtaking of [[China]] by the [[Western world]] as the major economic and industrial world power. Specifically, the theory seeks to explain how Europe could experience an [[industrial revolution]], but China did not. Theory supporters claim that although the prosperous [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasties]] moved China toward a modern age, the restrictions placed on commerce and industry and the persecution of non-orthodox thought after the [[Manchu conquest of China]] caused the country to stagnate and fall behind the West.

==Background==
Carl Dahlman and Jean-Eric Aubert of the [[World Bank]] argue, based on [[Angus Maddison]]'s data, that China was the world's largest and most advanced economy for the most of the past two millennia and among the wealthiest and most advanced economies until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlman, Carl J; Aubert, Jean-Eric. China and the Knowledge Economy: Seizing the 21st Century. WBI Development Studies. World Bank Publications. Accessed January 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] has claimed that China's [[GDP]] per capita exceeded Europe by a substantial margin from the 5th century BC onwards, but economic historian [[Angus Maddison]] believes that did not happen until the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddison|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which drastically increased GDP per capita even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elvin|1973|pp=7, 113–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; China experienced an [[economy of the Song dynasty|economic revolution]] in which the economy became [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialized]] and experienced large increases in industrial and agricultural output. At the same time, overseas and domestic trade increased, along with the use of currency. Some scholars have termed the phenomenon China's "medieval urban revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ni|Chen|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although China suffered large population loss and a devastated economy during the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol conquest]], the succeeding [[Ming dynasty]] brought economic growth, with per capita incomes and economic output surpassing its highest point during the Song dynasty. Late Ming [[laissez-faire]] policies such as nonintervention in markets and [[taxation in premodern China|low taxes]] further stimulated commerce and trade. During the Ming dynasty, the Chinese economy became very commercialised, as market agriculture replaced subsistence farming.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"&gt;{{harvnb|Xu|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wage labour]] became increasingly common, as large-scale private industry developed, displacing and often buying out government workshops.&lt;ref name="Zhang Xianlin"&gt;{{harvnb|Zhang|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert Allen estimates that family incomes and labor productivity of the Ming-era Yangtze Delta Region, the richest province of China, was far higher than contemporary Europe and exceeded the later Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|2009}}, figure 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a period of wealth and economic growth, the late Ming dynasty also brought intellectual fervor and liberalization. New thinkers like [[Wang Yangming]] and [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]] challenged orthodox Confucianism and argued that the words of [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]] were fallible and that wisdom was universal. They also questioned government power over the economy and personal rights.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt; Scholars of the [[Donglin school]] protested increases in government taxation during the [[Wanli Emperor]], and restrictions on freedom of speech, advocating a program similar to [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Zhang Xianlin"/&gt;

Ming dynasty scholars also adopted western science, including that of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt; Additional scientific advancement also flourished during the late Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt; Supporters of the theory contend that the economic and social developments during the late Ming paralleled the development of Europe in the 18th and the 19th centuries and would have allowed China to enter a modern age without the Manchu conquest and then the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang Xianlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"&gt;{{harvnb|Mao|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Supporters of the theory believe that the policies of the Qing Dynasty slowed China's advancement, which allowed Western nations to surpass China's prosperity during the [[medieval]] and the [[early modern]] eras. Specific Qing policies cited include literary persecution, interventions in foreign trade and domestic policies and restoration of serfdom as well as the devastation of the initial conquest itself.

=== Restrictions on foreign trade ===
Supporters most often point to Qing restriction on foreign trade as evidence of the theory.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang Xianlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"/&gt; During the Ming dynasty, considerable commerce existed between China, Japan and Western Europe, estimated by [[Joseph Needham]] at nearly 300 million taels of silver from 1578 to 1644 (for comparison, the total Ming state revenues were from 20 to 30 million taels).

However, during the Qing dynasty, foreign trade was prohibited completely from 1644 to 1683, and it later restricted to only one port at [[Guangzhou]]. In addition, commerce had to be conducted by 13 guilds approved by the government, with competition prohibited.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;

The government also refused to provide protection to overseas Chinese. The emperor did not protest of the massacres carried out by the Spanish and Dutch colonial authorities against the Chinese, such as what happened in the [[Spanish Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;

===Restoration of serfdom===
The restoration of [[serfdom]] is cited as another policy that greatly hampered the Chinese economy. After the conquest of China was completed, Manchu forces expropriated huge amounts of land, turning millions of people from tenant farmers into hereditary serfs.&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"/&gt; The amount of land requisitioned amounted to nearly 16 million mou, or nearly 10,666 km², of farmland.&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"/&gt; Serfdom was so common in the early Qing that slave markets were set up to buy and sell those who had been enslaved during the conquest.&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"/&gt;

=== Literary persecution ===
While literary persecution existed in China prior to Qing rule, it was rare and never widespread. During the late Ming dynasty, protests by scholars forced the government to declare that "speech will not be criminalized".&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt; However, the Qing government frequently used literary persecution to destroy Chinese opposition to Manchu rule. Several cases of literary persecution saw hundreds of intellectuals and their families executed, often for minor offenses such as referring to Manchus as "barbarians" and using the Qing character in areas that was deemed offensive by the government. Thousands of ancient texts deemed subversive were burned in the persecutions.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt; Protests by scholars, which had been common during the late Ming period, were also suppressed.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;

The persecutions extended to non-orthodox thought as well; scholars who disagreed with the standard [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] theories were executed along with a scientist who argued that the brain, rather than the heart, was the centere of thought.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;

===Domestic intervention===
The Qing dynasty intervened in the economy far more than its predecessors.&lt;ref name= "Li and Zheng pg 1017"&gt;{{harvnb|Li|Zheng|2001|p=1017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Ming dinasty, who had adopted laissez-faire policies, there was frequent intervention in the economy by restricting the number of merchants allowed to operate. The official edicts discouraged the cultivation of commercial crops, in favour of subsistence agriculture. Also, most new mines were prohibited.&lt;ref name="Myers and Wang"&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|Wang|606-609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the theory claim that such policies greatly damaged the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name="Xu Suming"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Li and Zheng pg 1017"/&gt;

===Devastation of initial conquest===
The initial conquest of China by the Manchus was one of the most devastating wars ever fought in Chinese history, and it set back Chinese progress decades. Examples of the devastation include the [[Yangzhou massacre]] in which some 800,000 people, including women and children, were massacred by the Manchus.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Shochu, Records of the Ten Day massacre in Yangzhou. Available in Chinese at Wikisource: [[wikisource:zh:揚州十日記|揚州十日記]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whole provinces, such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Jiangnan]], were thoroughly devastated and depopulated  by the Manchu conquest, which killed an estimated 25 million people. Some scholars estimate that the Chinese economy did not the regain the level reached in the late Ming dynasty until 1750, nearly a century after the foundation of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="Mao peiqi"/&gt; According to economic historian Robert Allen, family incomes in the [[Yangtze]] delta, China's richest province, was actually below Ming levels in 1820 but equal to that of contemporary Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|2009}}, table 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The destructive effects of the Manchu invasion were felt economically for decades. In the 1690s, Tang Chen, a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;More than fifty years have passed since the founding of the Ch’ing dynasty, and the empire grows poorer each day. Farmers are destitute, artisans are destitute, merchants are destitute, and officials too are destitute. Grain is cheap, yet it is hard to eat one’s fill. Cloth is cheap, yet it is hard to cover one’s skin. Boatloads of goods travel from one marketplace to another, but the cargoes must be sold at a loss. Officials upon leaving their posts discover they have no wherewithal to support their households. Indeed the [[four occupations]] are all impoverished!&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|Wang|2002|p=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Kenneth Pomeranz]], a noted critic of the theory, rejects the assertion that "certain Asian societies were headed toward an industrial breakthrough until Manchu or British invaders crushed the 'sprouts of capitalism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeranz|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds that the Qing "revitalization of the state" had a positive effect on the Chinese economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeranz|2000|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Quantitative history''' is an approach to [[history|historical research]] that makes use of [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], [[statistical]] and [[computer]] tools. It is considered a branch of ''social science history'' and has four leading journals: ''Historical Methods'' (1967- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heldref.org/hm.php Historical Methods online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043317/http://www.heldref.org/hm.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]'' (1968- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jih/ Journal of Interdisciplinary History online]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Social Science History'' (1976- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/ Social Science History online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''] (2010- ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative historians start with databases. Large quantities of economic and demographic data are available in print format. Quantifiers move these into computerized databases. The largest repository is the [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]] (ICPSR) at the [[University of Michigan]], which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the [[United States]] and the world.

== Data bases: economic ==

[[Economic historian]]s use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

''[[Content analysis]]'' is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby newspapers, magazines or similar sources are numerically coded according to a standardized list of topics. [Neuendorf, ''The Content Analysis Guidebook'' (2002)]

== Political history ==

Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.  '''Collective biography'' uses standardized information on a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

== New social history ==

The "new [[social historian]]s" (new in the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, and migrations and population changes.

An especially challenging technique is linking names ("nominal record linkage") of the same person whose information appears in multiple source such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

== Cliodynamics ==
[[Cliodynamics]] employs a scientific approach to the study of history and combines insights from [[cultural evolution]], [[macrosociology]], and [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]] to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

== Topics ==

In 2007-2008, the most viewed articles in ''Social Science History'' represented the breadth and style of the field. The five most viewed were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/reports/mfr1.dtl Reports], dukejournals.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--not working, 5 May 20019--&gt;

'''Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth''' model is one of the major historical models of [[economic growth]]. It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

# Traditional society
# Transitional society 
# Take-off
# Drive to technological maturity
# High mass consumption 

Rostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the "[[backwardness]]" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.

Rostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the "initial" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].

== Overview ==

Below is an outline of Rostow's Five Stages of Growth:
* '''Traditional Society'''
** characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a "primary" sector economy
** limited technology
** Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively 
** This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth
** No centralized nations or political systems.
* '''Pre-conditions to "take-off"'''
** External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.
** Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.
** Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)
** Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies
** Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux
** Individual social mobility begins
** Development of national identity and shared economic interests.
*'''Take-off'''
** Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.
** "Secondary" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.
** Textiles and apparel are usually the first "take-off" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic "[[Industrial Revolution]]"
** An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.
* '''Drive to Maturity'''
** Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly
** Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption
** Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.
** Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)
* '''Age of Mass Consumption'''
** the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in economy and society
** widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)
** consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods
** Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)
*'''Beyond consumption'''
**age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods
**large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption 
**a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth

Rostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?"&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.&lt;ref&gt;Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that "the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also—and equally—the uniqueness of each nation's experience."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical Framework ==

Rostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get "locked in", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of Development Process ==

=== Traditional Societies ===

An economy in this stage has an unlimited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production.

Wars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a "backward" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.

In settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission.  This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..

=== Pre-conditions for Take-off ===

In the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).

There are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.

Social overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.

All these changes effectively prepare the way for "take-off" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.
According to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which "set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; 

Referring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of "Pre Take-off" till "Drive to Maturity:" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the "Take-off" stage and far beyond.

=== Take-off ===

This stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's "second nature" and a shared goal.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt; In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term "transition", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.

Per Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off.&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The third requirement implies that the needed capital must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption.Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.  Rostow says that this transition does not follow a set trend as there are a variety of different motivations or stimulus which began this growth process.
Take off requires a large and sufficient amount of loanable funds for expansion of the industrial sector which generally come from two sources which are:
#Shifts in income flows by way of taxation, implementation of land reforms and various other fiscal measures.
#Re-investment of profits earned from foreign trade as has been observed in many East Asian countries.  While there are other examples of "Take-off" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based "take-off"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

[[File:table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]

The take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of "delayed gratification", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.

The ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:
*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.
*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.
*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.
*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.

An example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.

In the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.

=== Drive to Maturity ===

After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources."&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt; Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.

[[File:table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]
On comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.

The structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:
* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.
* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced
* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.
During this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.

A prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.

This diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

=== Age of High Mass Consumption ===

The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

Historically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

=== Dark Matter Consumption ===

This step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism of the model ==

# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.
# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.
# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.
# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.
# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.
# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic there is need for push always.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the "era of high mass consumption." The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Another assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].

Another criticism of Rostow's work is that it consideres large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass consumption is nigh.This does leave a potential "grim meathook future" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;"Grim Meathook Future" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Dependency theory]])

'''Rural history''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of historical research which focuses on the history of rural societies. At its inception, the field focused on the [[economic history]] of agriculture. Since the 1980s it has become increasingly influenced by [[social history]]. It can be considered an equivalent of [[urban history]].

A number of [[academic journal]]s and [[learned society|learned societies]] exist to promote rural history.

==History==
Rural history emerged as a distinct discipline from [[History of agriculture|Agricultural history]] in the 1980s and was inspired by the French [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] which favoured integrating economic, social and political history.{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=469}} Initially focused predominantly on the social history of rural life and later became increasingly interested in [[cultural history]].{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=477}}

In [[Europe]], the study of rural history is supported by the European Rural History Organisation (ERHO).

==National studies==

===Britain===
Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on  an "orthodox" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made "impressive progress" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History''. Led by Alun Howkins,&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside since 1900'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?" ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:03 sendia.jpg|thumb|Farmers from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]
{{main|History of agriculture in the United States}}
In the U.S. most rural history has focused on the South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old [[Frontier Thesis|frontier history]] as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History  of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization came in the 20th century, with the arrival of mechanization, the model T, and the agricultural agent—as well as radio.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Craig, ''Out of the Dark: A History of Radio and Rural America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Rural history has been a major specialty of French scholars since the 1920s, thanks especially to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised journals==
A number of [[academic journal]]s exist with a specific focus on rural history. These include:

*''[[Agricultural History (journal)|Agricultural History]]'' (1927–). United States.
*''[[Agricultural History Review]]'' (1953–). United Kingdom.
*''[[Histoire &amp; Sociétés Rurales]]'' (1990–). France.
*''[[Rural History (journal)|Rural History. Economy, Society, Culture.]]'' (1990–). United Kingdom.

[[File:HasekuraBookItalian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scipione Amati]]'s ''[[History of the Kingdom of Voxu]]'' (1615)  an example of a secondary source.]]
In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - The Close of the Silver Age (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''The Close of the Silver Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], c. 1527-35]]
A '''silver age''' is a name often given to a particular period within a history coming after a historical [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] whereby the Silver Age is a replication, being similarly prestigious and eventful but less so than the prior Golden Age. In many cultures the metal [[silver]] is generally valuable but less so than [[gold]].

==Greek myth==
The original silver age (Αργυρόν Γένος) was the second of the five "[[Ages of Man]]" described by the ancient poet [[Hesiod]] in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'', following the [[Golden age]] and preceding the Bronze Age. These people lived for one hundred years as children without growing up, then suddenly aged and died. [[Zeus]] destroyed these people because of their impiety, in the [[Ogygian Deluge]].

After [[Cronus|Kronos]] was exiled, the world was ruled by Zeus. As a result of Pandora releasing the evils upon the world, a second generation of men and the age was called silver because the race of man was less noble than the race of the Golden Age.

In the silver age Zeus reduced the spring, and reconstructed the year into four seasons, so that men for the first time sought the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food.

The first seeds of grain were placed in the ground since now man had to gather their own food. A child grew up at his mother's side a hundred years, but adulthood lasted a short time. Being less noble than the Golden Age, humanity could not keep from fighting with one another, nor would they properly honor and or serve the immortals. The actions of the second generation infuriated Zeus, so in punishment he destroyed them.

==Other silver ages==
The term has been applied to a number of other periods following a "Golden Age", including:

* The [[Silver Age of Latin literature]]
* The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the 2000 DC Comics series ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age]]'' was named after the period
* The [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]
* The [[Silver age of alpinism|Silver Age of Alpinism]]
* The [[Treta Yuga]] of Vedic philosophy of the ages.

'''Social cycle theories''' are among the earliest [[social theories]] in [[sociology]]. Unlike the theory of [[social evolutionism]], which views the [[evolution of society]] and [[human history]] as progressing in some new, unique direction(s), sociological cycle theory argues that events and stages of society and history are generally repeating themselves in cycles. Such a theory does not necessarily imply that there cannot be any [[social progress]]. In the early theory of [[Sima Qian]] and the more recent theories of long-term ("secular") political-demographic cycles&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=299&amp;Itemid=1 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Law of Social Cycle|Varnic theory]] of [[P.R. Sarkar]] an explicit accounting is made of social progress.

==Historical forerunners==
Interpretation of [[history]] as repeating cycles of Dark and Golden Ages was a common belief among ancient cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance By Daniel W. Rossides. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTYAGD7aKBkC&amp;lpg=PA69 Pg. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more limited cyclical view of history defined as repeating cycles of events was put forward in the academic world in the 19th century in [[historiosophy]] (a branch of [[historiography]]) and is a concept that falls under the category of [[sociology]]. However, [[Polybius]], [[Ibn Khaldun]] (see [[Asabiyyah]]), and [[Giambattista Vico]] can be seen as precursors of this analysis. The [[Saeculum]] was identified in Roman times. In recent times, P. R. Sarkar in his [[Social cycle theory (Sarkar)|Social Cycle Theory]] has used this idea to elaborate his interpretation of history.

==19th and 20th century theories==
Among the prominent historiosophers&lt;!--(?) (removed the question mark from the article, "historiosopher" yields a bunch of results on google, for whatever it's worth. if the term is correct feel free to remove this comment)--&gt;, [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Nikolai Danilewski]] (1822–1885) is important. In ''Rossiia i Evropa'' (1869) he differentiated between various smaller [[civilization]]s (Egyptian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, Roman, German, and Slav, among others). He wrote that each civilization has a life cycle, and by the end of the 19th century the Roman-German civilization was in decline, while the Slav civilization was approaching its [[Golden Age]]. A similar theory was put forward by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) who in his ''[[The Decline of the West|Der Untergang des Abendlandes]]'' (1918) also argued that the [[western world|Western civilization]] had entered its final phase of development and its decline was inevitable.

The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by [[Italy|Italian]] sociologist and economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) in his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an [[elite]] [[social class]], which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the [[power (sociology)|power]] constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.

Sociological cycle theory was also developed by [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] (1889–1968) in his ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (1937, 1943). He classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be ideational (reality is spiritual), sensate (reality is material), or idealistic (a synthesis of the two). He interpreted the contemporary West as a sensate civilization dedicated to [[technological progress]] and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era.

[[Alexandre Deulofeu]] (1903–1978) developed a mathematical model of social cycles that he claimed fit historical facts. He argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles in his book  ''Mathematics of History'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], published in 1951). He claims that each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of [[Romanesque art]], during the 9th century, in an area between [[Empordà]] and [[Roussillon]], which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization.

==Contemporary theories==
One of the most important recent findings in the study of the long-term dynamic social processes was the discovery of the political-demographic cycles as a basic feature of the dynamics of complex [[agrarian system]]s.

The presence of political-demographic cycles in the pre-modern history of [[Europe]] and [[China]], and in [[chiefdom]] level societies worldwide has been known for quite a long time,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Michael Postan|Postan]] 1950, 1973; [[Marshall Sahlins|Sahlins]] 1963; Abel 1974, 1980; [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|Ladurie]] 1974; Hodder 1978; [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]] 1973; Chao 1986; H. T. Wright 1984; Cameron 1989; [[Jack Goldstone|Goldstone]] 1991; Kul'pin 1990; [[David G. Anderson|Anderson]] 1994; Mugruzin 1986, 1994, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and already in the 1980s more or less developed [[mathematical models]] of demographic cycles started to be produced (first of all for Chinese "[[dynastic cycle]]s") (Usher 1989). At the moment we have a considerable number of such models (Chu and Lee 1994; Nefedov 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004; S. Malkov, Kovalev, and A. Malkov 2000; S. Malkov and A. Malkov 2000; Malkov and Sergeev 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Malkov et al. 2002; Malkov 2002, 2003, 2004; [[Peter Turchin|Turchin]] 2003, 2005a; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] et al. 2006).

Recently the most important contributions to the development of the [[mathematical]] models of long-term ("secular") sociodemographic cycles have been made by Sergey Nefedov, [[Peter Turchin]], [[Andrey Korotayev]], and Sergey Malkov.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Turchin|Turchin, P.]] (2003) ''Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147; [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; What is important is that on the basis of their models Nefedov, Turchin and Malkov have managed to demonstrate that sociodemographic cycles were a basic feature of complex agrarian systems (and not a specifically Chinese or European phenomenon).

The basic logic of these models is as follows:
* After the population reaches the ceiling of the [[carrying capacity]] of land, its growth rate declines toward near-zero values.
* The system experiences significant stress with decline in the living standards of the common population, increasing the severity of [[famine]]s, growing rebellions etc.
* As has been shown by Nefedov, most complex agrarian systems had considerable reserves for stability, however, within 50–150 years these reserves were usually exhausted and the [[system]] experienced a [[demographic]] collapse (a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]), when increasingly severe famines, [[epidemics]], increasing internal [[war]]fare and other disasters led to a considerable decline of [[population]].
* As a result of this collapse, free resources became available, per capita production and consumption considerably increased, the [[population growth]] resumed and a new sociodemographic cycle started.
It has become possible to model these dynamics mathematically in a rather effective way. Note that the modern theories of political-demographic cycles do not deny the presence of trend dynamics and attempt at the study of the interaction between cyclical and trend components of historical dynamics.

'''''The Heartland Series''''' is a series of [[television program]]s about the culture of [[Appalachia]], produced by [[WBIR-TV]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], over the 25-year period 1984 through 2009. The series has been produced on a limited basis since 2010.

==Production history==
''The Heartland Series'' was conceived in 1984 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] with a special series celebrating the people and land of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Actor [[Bill Landry]] was hired to host the series. He had previously been a teacher, had written and begun performing a one-man [[Play (theater)|play]] based on the life of [[Albert Einstein]] called "Einstein the Man," and had portrayed a fictional [[Tennessee River]] boat captain named "Captain Nat" as part of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) exhibit at the [[1982 World's Fair]] in Knoxville. Following the fair, he had continued to play the role of Captain Nat on a months-long [[barge]] tour of the Tennessee, [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]], and [[Mississippi River]]s that TVA conducted for its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutLandry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tva.gov/heritage/worldsfair/index.htm When the World Came to TVA], Tennessee Valley Authority website, accessed October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV series was initially scheduled to run for just three months.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;Leean Tupper, [http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations Goodbye: 'Heartland Series' melded the generations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025646/http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations |date=2011-09-28 }}, ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', August 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Landry, the original concept, formed by WBIR creative services director Steve Dean and station general manager Jim Hart, was "to take a [[video camera|camera]] and interview the last remnants of the old mountain people and go on location.”&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Each episode was three minutes and 40 seconds long,&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; designed to air in five-minute time slots during and after daily news broadcasts.

The series continued past the short run that was originally planned. Subject matter included [[geology]], wildlife, native plants, [[invasive species]], and other aspects of the region's [[natural history]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lifeways and [[archeology]], re-enactments and remembrances of historical events ranging from events in the [[American Revolutionary War]] to [[coal mining]] disasters and the early years of TVA, and feature stories about regional culture.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/wbir_stops_prod.shtml WBIR stops production of 'The Heartland Series'], Tele-Buddy's Tinseltown Tales, knoxnews.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his work on the series, host Bill Landry told an interviewer that he had learned to “[[Tanning (leather)|tan hides]], make jelly butter, saw logs, eat tree bark, carve [[soapstone]], build a [[log cabin]], cut timber, run a [[sawmill]], make [[moonshine]], [[Horseshoe|shoe a horse]], call a [[barred owl|hoot owl]], [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] like a [[deer]] and know when the [[American bison|buffalo]] runs.”&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; Traditional music was a perennial topic, including performances by and interviews with traditional musicians active in East Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=3&amp;StoryID=31 A Music Tale], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=1 Hardware Pickers], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrations by craftsmen who make musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=6&amp;StoryID=15 Artist in Residence - Fiddle Making], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and exploration of musical traditions such as [[old harp singing]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=2&amp;StoryID=17 Singing the Old Harp], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish and Irish influences on the region's music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=7&amp;StoryID=10 Ballads in Time], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two topics that the series generally avoided were [[politics]] and controversial religious practices such as [[snake handling]].&lt;ref name=Smyser&gt;Dick Smyser, Short takes and tall tales from Bill Landry's 'Heartland', ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', November 10, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Smokies national park, on-scene production locations in East Tennessee included the [[Museum of Appalachia]], where several episodes were taped, including the titles "1791," "Just Another Day," "The Music Tale," "The Toggins," "Frontier Music, Frontier Foods," and "Gift for Jacob,"&lt;ref name=Tupper/&gt; [[Rugby, Tennessee|Rugby]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=4&amp;StoryID=25 The Glory of Rugby], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roan Mountain State Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=28 Roan Mountain Pilgrimage], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Savage Gulf State Natural Area]] in [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=4 Wilderness Spared], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=2 Hensley], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Landry's skill as an [[interview]]er has been remarked upon by many observers. His folksy, rambling style made him effective at putting people at ease and drawing out the interesting stories of the people that he encountered in the "hills, hollows, small towns and major cities" of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smyser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venable/&gt;

In 1998, the series was expanded to include a 30-minute version airing each Saturday at 7:00 p.m., while it continued to run the original five-minute version during the morning news, after ''10 News at Noon'', and after ''10 News Nightbeat''.&lt;ref name=AboutLandry&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/b_landry.aspx About Bill Landry], WBIR website, accessed October 6, 1009&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, about 1,900 short episodes and 150 half-hour programs were produced in the show's 25-year history.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/apr/13/landry-concludes-25-years-sheartland-series/ 'Heartland Series' wrapping up after 25 years], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', April 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Landry was host and narrator for the entire series.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; He also served as co-producer and wrote and directed many episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridger.com/community/x1588597869/Heartlands-Bill-Landry-speaks-at-Arboretum-Society-meeting Heartland's Bill Landry speaks at Arboretum Society meeting], ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Dean was executive producer for 20 years, and Doug Mills was cameraman for all but one of the episodes.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesNews&gt;[http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=3759185 'Heartland Series' creator to speak at J.

The series has been successful with audiences, sometimes achieving [[Audience measurement|audience ratings]] of 7.0 or higher.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; In addition to being broadcast on WBIR, the series appeared on [[WTVC]] in [[Chattanooga]] during the 1980s and was shown on the [[Travel Channel]] (under the title ''Appalachian Stories'') for six years.&lt;ref name=Shearer&gt;John Shearer, [http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_156006.asp Former Chattanoogan Landry Had 25-Year Run With Popular Appalachian Features], The Chattanoogan,  August 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesNews/&gt;

===End of production===
In February 2009, WBIR announced plans to suspend production of the series in September 2009 after taking it "through to some sort of conclusion."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; WBIR general manager Jeff Lee cited economics as the reason for ending production, noting "it is a luxury for three people to produce 3-1/2 minutes of TV a week."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; He said that the station would continue to show the hundreds of episodes already produced "for as long as the viewers like them."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; More than 3,000 people signed an online [[petition]] asking for the series to be continued, but WBIR followed through with its plan to end it.&lt;ref name=Morrowprime/&gt; The last episode was taped at the [[Museum of Appalachia]] in [[Norris, Tennessee|Norris]] on August 8, 2009 before an audience estimated at 10,000 people, one of the largest crowds in the museum's history.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowfans&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml 10,000 fans turn out for last 'Heartland Series' taping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019224041/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml |date=2009-10-19 }}, Knoxnews.com, August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People seeking Landry's [[autograph]] waited in line for an hour.&lt;ref name=Morrowfans/&gt; The final show featured several [[Appalachian traditional music]]ians who had appeared previously in the series, including [[fiddler]] [[Danny Gammon]], [[Bobby Fulcher]], [[Tony Thomas (bluegrass musician)|Tony Thomas]] and [[Jimmy McCarroll]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/09/heartland-says-goodbye/  'Heartland Series' says goodbye; Many turn out to celebrate longtime WBIR series], Knoxville News Sentinel, August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode was scheduled for broadcast as an hour-long special on September 19, 2009, but  to avoid conflict with a [[Tennessee Volunteers]] football game the broadcast was postponed and rescheduled to be shown in a [[prime time]] slot at 8:00 p.m. on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/wbir_sets_date.shtml WBIR sets date for 'Heartland Series' finale], KnoxNews.com, September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/heartland_serie.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale postponed], KnoxNews.com, September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowprime&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/10/heartland_serie_1.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale to go primetime], KnoxNews.com, October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===

Public response to the cancellation of the series caused management to reconsider its demise. In 2010 producer Steve Dean was contracted to produce four more episodes, each an hour long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=116170 New Heartland Series program to air in March], WBIR-TV website, March 17, 2010.

==Recognition and influence==
During its 25-year history, ''The Heartland Series'' received four [[Emmy Award]]s, six [[Iris Award]]s from the [[NATPE|National Association of Television Program Executives]], one silver medal and two bronze medals from the [[New York International Film and Television Festival]], and a Theodore Roosevelt Award for Best Outdoor Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knoxvilletennessee.com/news.html Knoxville News / Knoxville Weather], KnoxvilleTennessee.com website, accessed October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day that the last episode was taped, former [[U.S. Senator]] [[Howard Baker]], who had appeared in one episode, called the series "the last iteration of our history and culture of a generation."&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Mark Brown, [[Carson Newman College]]'s director of news and media relations, described the series as "the nation's longest-running sociological video repository" and said "it did for Southern Appalachia what [[Studs Terkel]] did for [[Chicago]]."&lt;ref name=Venable&gt;Sam Venable, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/sep/18/whichever-way-the-wind-blows/ Whichever way the wind blows], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of hours of never-broadcast [[videotape]]s made during the show's 25-year history are being archived in the historical collection of the [[Frank H. McClung Museum|McClung Museum]] in Knoxville.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Episodes from the series have been incorporated into [[Appalachian studies]] curricula,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.east-tennessee-history.org/file/Appalachia%20Lesson%20Plans.pdf Teaching Tennessee History: Lesson Plans for the Classroom, Volume IV], East Tennessee Historical Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Heartland Series'' videos depicting Appalachian [[crafts]] and craftspeople are displayed in the "Appalachian Heritage" exhibit of the [[Children's Museum of Oak Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridger.com/entertainment/x1157493646/Appalachian-Heritage-Exhibit-grand-opening-Nov-8-at-Childrens-Museum Appalachian Heritage Exhibit grand opening Nov. 8 at Children's Museum], ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', October 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States embassies]] around the world keep tapes of ''The Heartland Series'' broadcasts as an information resource on life in Appalachia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gannett.com/about/map/ataglance/knoxvil.htm WBIR-TV], [[Gannett]] website, accessed October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme music==
The theme music for ''The Heartland Series'' is an arrangement of the ancient [[Gaels|Gaelic]] ballad "He Mandu," which is played on the [[hammered dulcimer]] by folklorist [[Guy Carawan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=9&amp;StoryID=6 The Hammer Dulcimer], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website.

'''''Translatio imperii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of rule") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]], in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an ''[[imperium]]'' that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an "[[emperor]]" (or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Western [[Holy Roman Empire]]). The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio studii]]'' (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[Jacques Le Goff]]&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;Le Goff, Jacques. ''La civilisation de l'Occident médieval''. Paris. 1964; English translation (1988): ''Medieval Civilization'', {{ISBN|0-631-17566-0}} &amp;ndash; "translatio imperii" is discussed in Part II, Chapter VI, section on "Time, eternity and history".&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ''translatio imperii'' concept as "typical" for the Middle Ages for several reasons:
* the idea of linearity of time and history was typical for the Middle Ages;
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea typically also neglected simultaneous developments in other parts of the world (of no importance to medieval Europeans);
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea didn't separate "divine" history from the history of "worldly power": medieval Europeans considered divine (supernatural) and material things as part of the same continuum, which was their reality. Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

Each medieval author described the ''translatio imperii'' as a succession leaving the supreme power in the hands of the monarch ruling the region of the author's provenance:
* [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]] (French area, 10th century): Roman Empire → [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Franks]] → '''[[Saxons]]'''&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto of Freising]] (living in German region): [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] → [[Byzantium]] → [[Franks]] → [[Longobards]] → '''[[Germany|Germans]]''' (=[[Holy Roman Empire]]);
* [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (living in medieval France): [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] → Rome → '''[[Medieval France|France]]'''&lt;ref&gt;De Troyes, Chrétien. ''[[Cligès]]''. Circa 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard de Bury]] (England, 14th century): "Athens" (Greece) → Rome → "Paris" (France) → '''[[England]]'''

Later, continued and reinterpreted by modern and contemporary movements and authors (some known examples):
* [[Fifth Monarchists]] (England, 17th century): [[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → [[Persian Empire|Persians]] → [[Macedonian Empire]] → Rome → '''England''' (and the '''[[British Empire]]''' later)
* [[António Vieira]] (Portugal, 17th century): [[Assyrian Empire|Assyro]]-[[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → Persians → Greeks → Romans → '''[[Portuguese Empire]]'''
* [[Fernando Pessoa]] (Portugal, 20th century): Greece → Rome → [[Christianity]] → [[Europe]] → '''[[Portugal]]'''

Medieval and Renaissance authors often linked this transfer of power by genealogically attaching a ruling family to an ancient Greek or Trojan hero; this schema was modeled on [[Virgil]]'s use of [[Aeneas]] (a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero) as progenitor of the city of [[Rome]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.  Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'') and [[Wace]] (in his ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'') linked the founding of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]] to the arrival of [[Brutus of Troy]], son of Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Bratu, Cristian. "Translatio, autorité et affirmation de soi chez Gaimar, Wace et Benoît de Sainte-Maure." The Medieval Chronicle 8 (2013): 135-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, the French Renaissance author [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] (in his ''Les Illustrations de Gaule et Singularités de Troie'') linked the founding of Celtic [[Gaul]] to the arrival of the Trojan [[Francus]] (i.e. [[Astyanax]]), the son of [[Hector]]; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of [[Priam]]; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] and [[Charlemagne]] (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for [[Ronsard]]'s epic poem, "La Franciade").

== From the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire ==
The cardinal point in the idea of the ''Translatio imperii'' is the link between the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire.
*[[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine I]] established [[Constantinople]], a [[New Rome]], as a second capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.
*After the death of [[Theodosius I|Emperor Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire is permanently divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire).
*With the demise of the Western Empire in 476, the Byzantine Empire remained as the sole Roman Empire.
*Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] married his son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] to [[Irene of Athens]] on 17 December 768, brought to [[Constantinople]] by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, [[Constantine VI|Constantine]]. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became [[regent]] for their nine-year-old son, [[Constantine VI]].
*As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of Frankish king Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. 
*As [[Constantine VI]] approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797 Irene deposed her son, who died soon afterwards.
*Some western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and many of the cities of the Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial name. [[Pope Leo III]], crowned Charlemagne as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire.
*Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], who alone mentions it, the scheme was frustrated by [[Aetios (eunuch)|Aetios]], one of her favourites.&lt;ref&gt;See Garland, p. 89, who explains that Aetios was attempting to usurp power on behalf of his brother Leo.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by [[Nikephoros I]]. She was exiled and died the following year.
* ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'',  a [[peace treaty]] in 803 between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] and [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]], [[Basileus]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].
* Recognition of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Emperor]] ([[Basileus]]) in 812 by Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]), after he reopened negotiations with the [[Franks]]. In exchange for that recognition, [[Venice]] was returned to the Byzantine Empire.
* On February 2, 962, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was solemnly crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope John XII]]. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto's desire, founded the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the [[pallium]] on the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[Archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[Bishop of Verona]]. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the famous ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the [[Donation of Pepin]].

The '''Twentieth Century Society''' ('''C20''') is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] which campaigns for the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of [[architectural]] heritage from 1914 onwards.&lt;ref name="C20about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society's interests embrace buildings and artefacts that characterise 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; It is formally recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[listed building]]s within its period of interest, and must be notified of any proposed work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was formed as The Thirties Society in 1979, the year in which the prominent "Thirties – British art and design before the War" exhibition was shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]].&lt;ref name=c20history&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gavin |last1=Stamp |authorlink1=Gavin Stamp |first2=Alan |last2=Powers |authorlink2=Alan Powers |title=A Brief History |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was inspired by and loosely modelled on the [[Victorian Society]], which aims to protect pre-1914 Victorian and Edwardian buildings. [[Bevis Hillier]] was the first president, and [[Clive Aslet]] the first honorary secretary.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; In 1992, the society changed its name to The Twentieth Century Society, as it was felt that "Thirties Society" failed to indicate its interest in the protection of buildings from other periods as well.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;

==Notable cases and campaigns==
*The catalyst for establishing the society in 1979 was the proposal to replace Sir [[Edwin Cooper (architect)|Edwin Cooper]]'s classical 1928 building for [[Lloyds of London]] with a new building by [[Richard Rogers]]. The society's protests were too late, and Rogers' [[Lloyd's building]] was completed in 1986 (and was itself [[listed building|listed]] Grade I in 2011).&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*The society's first serious high-profile case was that of the [[Art Deco]] [[Firestone tyre factory]] of 1928 on the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Great West Road]] in West London. The building was demolished by its owners over a [[bank holiday]] weekend in August 1980 in anticipation of its being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1985–6 the society campaigned against the wholesale replacement of the traditional K-series [[red telephone box]]es designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] between 1926 and 1936. The campaign attracted much public support, and led to a number of boxes being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1987, the society successfully campaigned for the listing of [[Bracken House, London]], the former home of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', designed by Sir [[Albert Richardson]] and built between 1955 and 1958. This was the first post-[[Second World War]] building to be listed, the previous cut-off date having been 1939.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; 
*In 1993–4, the society successfully persuaded the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] to take into care and open to the public [[2 Willow Road]], [[Hampstead]], completed in 1939, and designed by the Hungarian architect [[Ernő Goldfinger]] for his own occupation.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; 
* In the 1980s and 1990s the society campaigned repeatedly for the preservation and listing of [[Bankside Power Station]], designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], constructed in two phases in 1947–52 and 1958–63, and decommissioned in 1981. The campaign was ultimately successful, and the building reopened as the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2000.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt;

The '''Walam Olum''' or '''Walum Olum''', usually translated as "Red Record" or "Red Score," is purportedly a historical narrative of the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe. The document has provoked controversy as to its authenticity since its publication in the 1830s by [[botanist]] and [[antiquarian]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]]. [[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] studies in the 1980s and analysis in the 1990s of Rafinesque's [[manuscripts]] have produced significant evidence that the document is a hoax. Some Delaware people, however, believe Rafinesque based his writing on actual Lenape stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/lenape_culture.htm Lenape Nation: Lenape Culture], Native Languages&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Walamolum01.jpg|thumb|280px|Walam Olum pictograph]]

==The work==
In 1836 in his first volume of ''The American Nations'', Rafinesque published what he represented as an [[English (language)|English]] translation of the entire text of the ''Walam Olum'', as well as a portion in the [[Lenape language]].

The ''Walam Olum'' includes a [[creation myth]], a [[deluge myth]], and the narrative of a series of [[Human migration|migrations]]. Rafinesque and others claimed or interpreted the migrations to have begun in [[Asia]]. The Walam Olum suggested a migration over the [[Bering Strait]] took place 3,600 years ago.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;Jackson, Brittany and Mark Rose. [http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/hoaxes/walam_olum.html "Walam Olum Hokum."] ''Archaeology.'' 4 Dec 2009 (retrieved 26 Dec 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The text included a long list of chiefs' names, which appears to provide a timescale for the epic. According to Rafinesque, the chiefs appeared as early as 1600 [[BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rafinesque, C.S.,''The American nations; or, outlines of their general history, ancient and modern, including: the whole history of the earth and mankind in the western hemisphere; the philosophy of American history; the annals, traditions, civilization, lanuguages, &amp;c., of all the American nations, tribes, empires, and states '' 1836 p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XYlHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=rafinesque+chiefs+1600&amp;ei=QqR5S8WDLInwMozL4csE&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The story in summary===
The narrative begins with the formation of the universe, the shaping of the Earth, and the creation of the first people, by the Great [[Manitou]]. Then, as the Great Manitou creates more creatures, an evil manitou creates others, such as flies. Although all is harmonious at first, an evil being brings unhappiness, sickness, disasters and death. A great snake attacked the people and drove them from their homes. The snake flooded the land and made monsters in the water, but the Creator made a giant turtle, on which the surviving people rode out the flood, and prayed for the waters to recede. When land emerged again, they were in a place of snow and cold, so they developed their skills of house-building and hunting, and began explorations to find more temperate lands. Eventually, they chose to head east from the land of the Turtle to the land of the Snake, walking across the frozen ocean and first reaching a land of spruce trees.

After a few generations (from this point on, chiefs of the tribe are named), they began to spread into the adjoining territories. Many generations passed (the characteristics of each chief briefly described), until a large part of the nation decided to invade the territory of the Talegawi people, aided by the northern Talamatan. Although the invasion eventually succeeded, the Talamatan later became hostile, but were soon subdued, and a further long period of consolidation began. Slow expansion into the rich eastern lands eventually reached another sea, where, after generations, the first white men arrived in ships.

There the text ends, though Rafinesque did publish an additional "Fragment: On the History of the Linapis since abt. 1600, when the Wallamolum closes" which takes the story up to his own time. This (which incidentally names the composer of the original Walam Olum as one Lekhibit) exists only as a purported translation by John Burns, who has himself never been satisfactorily identified.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Leopold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVzI3z8NugkC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=%22rafinesque+%22john+burns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hskaj25aHs&amp;sig=UbjDpHu6erlO-ydJimuQ7PeEuVM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CU1KTdiLLcimhAem4MzlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rafinesque%20%22john%20burns%22&amp;f=false  ''Early nineteenth-century contributions to American Indian and general linguistics: Du Ponceau and Rafinesque''] Springer (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2506-2}}, p315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Rafinesque claimed the original narrative was recorded in pictographs on birch bark, or cedar wood tablets or sticks (Rafinesque explained that "Olum... implies a record, a notched stick, an engraved piece of wood or bark.")  He said "the late Dr. Ward of Indiana" acquired the materials in 1820 from a Lenape patient in return for a medical cure, and eventually passed them on to Rafinesque. From Rafinesque's personal notes and a family legend, this Dr. Ward was tentatively identified in 1954 as Dr John Russell Ward, a Kentucky physician who died in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;Weer, Paul (1954). "History of the Walam Olum Manuscript and Painted Records". In Voegelin, Charles F. (et al.) ''Walam Olum; or, Red Score, the Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape'', Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; but a potential Indiana candidate has been identified: Malthus A. Ward&lt;ref&gt;William Barlow and David O. Powell [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27790973 "The Late Dr. Ward of Indiana": Rafinesque's Source of the Walam Olum"] in ''Indiana Magazine of History'' Vol. 82, No. 2 (June 1986), pp. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; (1794–1863, so not "late" in the sense of "deceased") who spent some of his early career in Indiana, moved to New England in 1823 and from 1831 was professor of natural history at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2180 "Malthus Ward (1794-1863)"] in the ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Accessed 2010-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; He said the explanatory transcription of verses in the [[Lenape language]] came from a different source, in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Daniel G. (1885) ''The Lenâpé and their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum''&lt;/ref&gt; After his translation was published, Rafinesque said he lost the actual plaques.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

When Rafinesque wrote an essay on the Lenape language in October 1834, he did not mention the ''Walam Olum'' at all.  It was two months later that he submitted a supplement about it.  This was shortly after he acquired a list of authentic Lenape names compiled by [[John Heckewelder]].&lt;ref name="oestr"&gt;Oestreicher, David M. (1996) "Unraveling the Walam Olum", ''Natural History'' 105 (10):14–21. (also revised version in Boewe, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Rafinesque's translation of the 183 verses totals fewer than 3,000 words. In his manuscript he juxtaposed the pictographs with the verses in Lenape language that explained them. This material is now held at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and has been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Wallam-Olum: first and second parts of the painted and engraved traditions of the Linnilinapi / translated word for word by C. S. Rafinesque. [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/2571471 UPenn Ms. Coll. 700, Item 217]&lt;/ref&gt; Any items in Rafinesque's large collection of specimens, which did not find a ready sale after his death were apparently destroyed. There is no evidence other than Rafinesque's testimony that the original sticks existed. Scholars have only his work to study.

Twentieth-century archaeology has confirmed that by Rafinesque's time, Native Americans had been using birch bark scrolls for over 200 years.  In 1965 the archaeologist Kenneth Kidd reported on two finds of "trimmed and fashioned pieces of birch bark on which have been scratched figures of animals, birds, men, [[myth]]ological creatures, and esoteric symbols" in the [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Head-of-the-Lakes]] region of [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]]. Some of these resembled scrolls used by the [[Midewiwin|Mide Society]] of the [[Ojibwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll from one of these finds was later dated to about 1560 +/-70 [[common era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rajnovich, Grace. ''Reading Rock Art: Interpreting the Indian Rock Paintings of the Canadian Shield''. Dundurn Press Ltd., 1994. {{ISBN|0-920474-72-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 19th century==
While there was controversy about the ''Walam Olum'', it was treated as an accurate account by historians, [[anthropologist]]s, and archaeologists for many years.  [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim G. Squier]], widely regarded as an influential figure of American 19th-century [[archaeology]], republished the text in 1849. He accepted it as genuine, partially on internal evidence but also because the educated Indian chief (Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh) ([[George Copway]]), to whom he showed the manuscript, "unhesitatingly pronounced it authentic, in respect not only to the original signs and accompanying explanations in the Delaware dialect, but also in the general ideas and conceptions which it embodies. He also bore testimony to the fidelity of the translation." More recently, Barnhart noted that Copway was "fluent in his native dialect and knowledgeable of the traditions of the Ojibwa and other Algonquian groups such as the Lenape, but he was certainly not an expert on the traditions and language of the Delaware."&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1849, after the documented was republished, [[Henry Schoolcraft|Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] wrote to Squier that he believed the document is "well sustained by comparisons with such transcripts as I have obtained from bark scrolls, and the tabular pieces of wood called music boards".
 
In 1885, after the third printing,&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; the well-known [[ethnographer]] [[Daniel G. Brinton]] published a new translation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garrison Brinton, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 1885 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=jaZegQr677wC&amp;dq=rafinesque+walam+olum+&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f-A73ojqP2&amp;sig=OTQRiPltl-2am1E189ruL5lEV5E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ''The Lenâpé and Their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum. A New Translation, and an inquiry into its authenticity''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Brinton explained, "In several cases the figures or symbols appear to me to bear out the corrected translations which I have given of the lines, and not that of Rafinesque.  This, it will be observed, is an evidence, not merely that he must have received this text from other hands, but the figures also, and weighs heavily in favor of the authentic character of both."&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1885 edition may have been read by ethnographer and explorer [[James Mooney]]. Published in 1888, his ''[[Myths of the Cherokee]]'' references the ''Walum Olum.'' In his "Historical sketch of the Cherokee" at the beginning of the work he attempts to adduce the origins of the term 'Cherokee:' "...among other synonyms for the tribe are Rickahockan or Rechahecrian, the ancient Powhatan name, and Tallige', or Tallige'wi, the ancient name used in the ''Walam Olum'' chronicle of the Lenape'."&lt;ref name=Mooney1888&gt;Mooney, James. King, Duane (ed.). ''Myths of the Cherokee.'' Barnes &amp; Noble. New York. 1888 (2007). pp. 4 - 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 20th century==
In the 1930s, [[Erminie Voegelin]] attempted to find evidence of ''Walam Olum'' narrative elements in independent Lenni-Lenape and Delaware sources; the parallels were at best inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Erminie W., "Cultural parallels," pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts about the text's authenticity began to grow. In 1952 renowned archaeologist [[James Bennett Griffin]] publicly announced that he “had no confidence in the 'Walam Olum'.”  Historian [[William A. Hunter]] also believed the text a hoax. In 1954 archaeologist [[John G. Witthoft]] found linguistic inaccuracies and suspicious correspondences of words in the texts to 19th-century Lenape-English word lists.  He concluded that Rafinesque composed the narrative from Lenape texts already in print.&lt;ref name="witt"&gt;Witthoft, John, 1955. "The Walam Olum Project", ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' Vol. 21, p194.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, he announced in the ''Journal of American Linguistics'' the start of a ''Walam Olum'' project for further study, but this project did not take place.&lt;ref name="witt"/&gt;

In 1954, a multidisciplinary team of scholars from the [[Indiana Historical Society]] published another translation and commentary.  They stated, "The 'Red Score' is a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture." A reviewer noted that the team was not able to identify Dr. Ward, and he concluded that the document's origins "are undeniably clouded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of "Walam Olum or Red Score. The  Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians. A New Translation,  Interpreted by Linguistic, Historical, Archaeological, Ethnological, and  that Physical Anthropological Studies"|journal=American Antiquity|date=October 1955|first=Richard  B.|last=Woodbury|volume=21|issue=2|pages=191–192|id=  |format=|doi=10.2307/276869|publisher=American Antiquity, Vol. 21, No. 2|jstor=276869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthropologist [[Della Collins Cook]] commented on the 1954 study, "The scholarly essays are best read as exercises in stating one's contradictory conclusions in a manner designed to give as little offense as possible to one's sponsor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Buikstra, Jane]] and Lane Beck, eds. ''Bioarchaeology: The Contextual Analysis of Human Remains'', Academic Press (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-12-369541-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other translations and commentaries have followed, including translations into languages other than English.

[[Selwyn Dewdney]], art educator and researcher into [[Ojibwa]] art and [[anthropology]], wrote the only comprehensive study of the Ojibwa birch bark scrolls (''[[wiigwaasabak]]oon''). In it he wrote: "A surviving [[pictographic]] record on wood, preserved by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Delaware long after they had been shifted from their original homeland on [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shores at the mouth of the [[Delaware River]], offers evidence of how ancient and widespread is the [[myth]] of a flood (see [[Deluge (mythology)]]) involving a powerful water ''[[manitou]]''. The record is known as the ''Walum Olum'' (Painted Sticks), and was interpreted for [[George Copway]] by a Delaware Elder... Apart from the reference to man's moral wickedness, the mood and imagery of the ''Walum Olum'' convey an archaic atmosphere that surely predates European Influence."&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, Selwyn. 1975. ''The Sacred Scrolls of the Southern Ojibway''. Glenbow Museum &amp; University Of Toronto Press. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of his study by the anthropologist Edward S Rogers states "Dewdney is apt to rely upon ethnographic generalizations that were in vogue a quarter of a century ago, but in the intervening years have been modified or disproven...Dewdney handles ethnohistorical matters no better than he does ethnographic topics... Dewdney has deceived the unwary that do not realize that the exact distributions and certain proposed migrations of Ojibwa still remain unresolved. A final word, but one that is of paramount importance, must be voiced. How will the [[Ojibwa]] react to this book? Most likely, negatively, from the few comments received to date. The fact that "Sacred" information is being divulged will be resented."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Edward S., ''Ethnohistory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, (Winter, 1975), pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky-based writer [[Joe Napora]] wrote a modern translation of the text, which was published in 1992. At the time he thought the ''Walam Olum'' was genuine.  In his preface, he wrote, "My belief is that the Walam Olum is closely related to the [[Midewiwin#Teaching scrolls|Mide Scrolls]] that Dewdney wrote so eloquently about in 'Sacred Scrolls of the Ojibway.'"&lt;ref&gt;Napora, Joe. ''The Walam Olum / as translated by Joe Napora''. Greenfield Center, NY: Greenfield Review Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-912678-82-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, however, ethnologists had collected enough independent information "to discount the ''Walam olum'' completely as a tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert C. Kraft]], an expert on the Lenape,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDF1331F934A15752C1A96E948260 "Lenape Expert Assails Phone Flier"], ''New York Times'' online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnj.org/herbert_c.html "Archaeological Society of New Jersey Lifetime Achievement Award"]&lt;/ref&gt; had long suspected the document to be a fraud. He stated that it did not square with the archaeological record of migrations by the prehistoric ancestors of the Lenape.  In addition, he cited a 1985 survey conducted among Lenape elders by ethnologists David M. Oestreicher and James Rementer that revealed traditional Lenape had never heard of the narrative. The older Lenape people said that they "found its text puzzling and often incomprehensible." Oestreicher examined the Lenape language text with fluent native speaker, Lucy Parks Blalock, and they found problems such as frequent use of English idioms.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

In 1991 Steven Williams summarized the history of the case and the evidence against the document, lumping it with many other famous archaeological frauds.  The existence of genuine historic pictogram documents elsewhere does not overcome the textual and ethnological problems of the ''Walam Olum''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Steven. ''Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' since 1994==
In 1994, and afterwards, textual evidence that the Walam Olum was a hoax was supplied by David M. Oestreicher in “Unmasking the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Hoax.” Oestreicher examined Rafinesque's original manuscript and "found it replete with crossed-out Lenape words that had been replaced with others that better matched his English 'translation.' In other words, Rafinesque had been translating from English to Lenape, rather than the other way round".&lt;ref name="oestr"/&gt; In general, he found a variety of evidence that the ''Walam Olum'' was not an authentic historical record but was composed by someone having only a slight familiarity with the Lenape language. Oestreicher argued that Rafinesque crafted the linguistic text from specific sources on the Delaware Language published by the American Philosophical Society and elsewhere.  Further, he said that the supposedly "Lenape" pictographs were hybrids from published [[Egypt]]ian, [[China|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] sources.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; 
Barnhart concurs, stating that "the pictographs are in no way comparable to the figures found on the stone carvings or [[petroglyphs]] found in ''[[Lenapehoking]]'', the traditional homeland of the Lenape.&lt;ref&gt;Barton: 140&lt;/ref&gt;  David Oestreicher asserted that the stories were a conglomerate assembled from numerous sources from different cultures that spanned the globe.  Barnhart was of the opinion that Rafinesque created the ''Walam Olum'' in hopes of winning the international ''Prix Volney'' contest hosted in [[Paris]], and Barnhart thought that Rafinesque wanted to prove his long-held theories regarding the peopling of America. Oestreicher’s findings were summarized by Herbert Kraft in his study, "The Lenape-Delaware Indian Heritage: 10,000 BCE to 2000 CE.", and by Jennifer M. Lehmann in "Social Theory as Politics in Knowledge".

Later David Oestreicher wrote that he had received a direct communication from Joe Napora.  Oestreicher wrote that Napora wrote, "[H]e now recognises that the 'Walam Olum' is indeed a hoax...and was dismayed that the sources upon whom he relied had been so negligent in their investigation of the document and that the hoax should have been continued as long as it has".&lt;ref name="oest2"&gt;Oestreicher, "Hoax," pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oestreicher's very detailed analyses have not found a wide audience, but they have made it possible to go a step further, and study the thinking and cultural assumptions of earlier researchers (for example by examining how they treated features of the ''Walam Olum'' which should have been clear evidence that it was a fake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Walam Olum: An Indigenous Apocrypha and Its Readers|journal=American Literary History|year=2010|first=Andrew|last=Newman|volume=22|issue=1|pages=26–56|doi=10.1093/alh/ajp055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent biography of Rafinesque concluded: "There is now very good reason to believe that he fabricated important data and documents... The most egregious example is the Lenni Lenape migration saga, 'Walam Olum', which has perplexed scholars for one and a half centuries. Rafinesque wrote the 'Walam Olum' believing it to be ''authentic'' because it accorded with his own belief—he was merely recording and giving substance to what must be true. It was a damaging, culpably dishonest act, which misled scholars in search of the real truth, far more damaging than his childish creations, which could be easily dismissed; this was more than mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Leonard. 2005. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/081312316X ''Constantine Samuel Rafinesque: A Voice in the American Wilderness''.] Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2316-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional Lenape believe they have lived in their homeland (that is, in the [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] area) forever. The [[Delaware Tribe of Indians]], located in eastern Oklahoma, originally endorsed the document but withdrew their endorsement on February 11, 1997 after reviewing the evidence.&lt;ref name ="oest2"/&gt; The Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania emphasize their belief that they have been in the area for 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenapenation.org/lenapeculture.html Lenape Nation - A Tribal Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst concluding that the burden of proof lies on those who believe the ''Walam Olum'' to be authentic, Barnhart states that "whatever one's position on the 'Walam Olum', its controversial place in the history of American anthropology is most definitively secured."&lt;ref&gt;Barnheart, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference in literature ==
[[Paula Gunn Allen]]'s poetry collection, ''Shadow Country'', from 1982 contains a reference to the ''Walam Olum''. In Part II of the poem, ''ANOTHER LONG WALK'', it says:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quantify the myths''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''symbolic utterance of the Grandfather (Lenape)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count    /     years on the Red Score''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''wich does not''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count for history''&lt;/blockquote&gt;"the Red Score" is the reference, and is also related to the mention of ''[[Lenape]]'' in line 2.
