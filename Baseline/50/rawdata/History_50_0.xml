[[File:Jiahu writing.svg|thumb|150px|Jiahu symbols from 6600 BC, [[Henan]], [[China]]]]{{use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}
The '''7th millennium BC''' spanned the years 7000 through 6001 BC. During this time, [[agriculture]] spread from [[Anatolia]] to the [[Balkans]].

[[World population]] begins to grow at an exponential pace due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]], reaching perhaps 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25, estimates 40 million at 5000 BC and 100 million at 1600 BC, for an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. over the Chalcolithic to Middle Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the agricultural communities of the [[Middle East]], the [[cow]] was domesticated and use of [[pottery]] became common, spreading to [[Europe]] and [[South Asia]], and the first [[metal]] (gold and copper) ornaments were made.

==Cultures==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3207">'''Arnauld de Oihenart''' (7 August 1592{{snd}}14 January 1668) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] lawyer, politician, historian and poet.

Born at [[Mauléon-Licharre|Mauléon]], he studied law at [[Bordeaux]], where he took his degree in 1612. He practised first in his native town, and after his marriage to Jeanne d'Erdoy, the heiress of a noble family of [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], at the bar of the [[Parliament of Navarre and Béarn|Parliament of Navarre]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Oihenart, Arnauld de|volume=20|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a lawyer at the Estates of [[Soule]], where he was elected commoner representative in 1663.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

He spent his leisure and his fortune in the search for documents bearing on the old Basque and [[Béarn]]ese provinces; and the fruits of his studies in the archives of [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], [[Périgord]] and other cities were embodied in forty-five manuscript volumes, which were sent by his son Gabriel to [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]. Twenty of these are in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris]] (Coll. Duchesne).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In his quest for information, he attempted to scour the files of the Accountancy Chamber or ''Comptos'' in the Spanish Navarre, but was denied access by the viceroy to prevent his using it against the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|1512 Spanish military takeover]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Oihenart published in 1625 a ''Déclaration historique de l'injuste usurpation et retention de la Navarre par les Espagnols'' and a fragment of a [[Latin]] work on the same subject is included in {{Interlanguage link multi|Auguste Galland|fr|3=Auguste Galland|lt=Auguste Galland's}} ''Mémoires pour l'histoire de Navarre'' (1648). His most important work is ''Notitia utriusque Vasconiae, tum Ibericae, tum Aquitanicae, qua praeter situm regions et alia scitu digna'' (1638 and 1656), a description of [[Gascony]] and Navarre. His collection of 537 Basque proverbs or adages, ''Atsotizac edo Refravac'', included in a volume of his poems ''Gastroa Nevrthizetan'', printed in Paris in 1657 under the French title ''Les Proverbes Basques Recueillis Par Le Sr D’Oihenart, Plus Les Poesies Basques du mesme Auteur'', was supplemented by a second collection, ''Atizen Venquina''. The proverbs were edited by [[Francisque Xavier Michel]] (1847), and the supplement by [[P. Hariston]] (1892) and by [[V. Stempf]] (1894).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Bandele Omoniyi''' (6 November 1884&amp;nbsp;– 1913)&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&amp;pg=PA349 ''Encyclopedia of African History''], Volume 1, Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005, p. 596.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nigeria]]n [[nationalist]] who is best known for his book ''[[A Defence of the Ethiopian Movement]]'' (1908), which urged for political reforms in the colonies, warning that otherwise a revolution in Africa might end British rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPCKe-X7d3EC&amp;pg=PA109 David Killingray, ''Africans in Britain'', Frank Cass &amp; Company, 1994, p. 109.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hakim Adi]], he is one of the earliest examples of the politically active West African student in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hakim Adi, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/722845?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101341855267 "Bandele Omoniyi--A Neglected Nigerian Nationalist"], ''African Affairs'', Vol. 90, No. 361 (October 1991), pp. 581–605.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bandele Omoniyi was born in [[Lagos]], in present-day Nigeria, and his parents sold their land to finance his studies in Britain, where Omoniyi first went in 1905. Enrolling at [[Edinburgh University]] in 1906 to study law, he eventually gave up his studies as he became increasingly involved in political activities, taking up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperial]] journalism in socialist, Scottish and Nigerian publications.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Green, ''Black Edwardians: Black People in Britain 1901-1914'', Frank Cass Publishers, 1998, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to various British politicians, including the Prime Minister, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], and the future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]], demanding representation for [[Scramble for Africa#United Kingdom|Africans in the colonies]]. In 1907 Omoniyi criticised colonial rule in a series of letters to the ''[[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine|Edinburgh Magazine]]''. He also wrote articles for the West African press, and in 1908 published his major work, ''A Defence of the Ethiopian Movement'', in Edinburgh, dedicating it "to The Right Honourable and Honourable Members of the British Parliament".&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion"&gt;Hakim Adi, "Omoniyi, Bandele", in David Dabydeen. John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Black British History'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omoniyi later moved to [[Brazil]] around 1910, where he was subsequently arrested for his political activities. He refused assistance from the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adi|first=Kakim|title=Bandele Omoniyi – Student Politician|journal=''[[Black and Asian Studies Association|Association for the Study of African, Caribbean and Asian Culture and History in Britain Newsletter]]''| date=December 1991 |issue=2|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imprisoned, he contracted [[beriberi]] and died, aged 28.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">The '''Black Audio Film Collective''' ('''BAFC'''), founded in 1982 and active until 1998, comprised seven [[Black British]] and diaspora [[multimedia artist]]s and film makers: [[John Akomfrah]], Lina Gopaul, Avril Johnson, Reece Auguiste, Trevor Mathison, Edward George and Claire Joseph. Joseph left in 1985 and was replaced by David Lawson. The group initially came together as students at [[Portsmouth Polytechnic]] (their backgrounds included sociology, fine art and psychology),&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Clark, [http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/rep-diary-black-audio-film-collective "Rep Diary: Black Audio Film Collective"], Film Comment, 3 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and after graduation relocated to [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] in [[east London]].

==Background==
The formation of the Black Audio Film Collective, like that of [[Sankofa Film and Video Collective]], was a response to the social unrest in Britain in the 1980s: "Influenced by contemporary debate on post-colonialism and social theorists such as [[Homi_K._Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]] and [[Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)|Stuart Hall]], both groups centered around investigations of black identity/culture within the British experience and reworked the documentary to articulate new voices in British cinema."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinemaproject.org/screenings/fall/2004/black-audio-and-sankofa/ "Black Audio &amp; Sankofa Film Collectives"], Cinema Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The BAFC's output has been variously described as "an extraordinary body of poetic, allusive, and intensely personal films, videos, and 'slide-tape texts' that chronicled England’s multicultural past and present and pushed the boundaries of the documentary form",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bam.org/film/2014/black-audio-film-collective "Black Audio Film Collective"], BAMcinématek.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the expression of a generation of diasporic subjects that seized the idea of 'blackness' as an identity marker as well as a claim to political visibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cencia.gsu.edu/black-audio-film-collective/ “Black Audio Film Collective”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028180345/http://cencia.gsu.edu/black-audio-film-collective/ |date=October 28, 2014 }}, CENCIA, Georgia State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering films they produced are still considered influential.&lt;ref&gt;The Otolith Group, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/this_day_remains/ "This Day Remains"], Frieze, Issue 106, April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Celluloid Liberation Front, [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/film/2012/09/handsworth-1985-re-writing-riots "Handsworth, 1985: Re-writing the riots – The Black Audio Film Collective's film still resonates"], ''New Statesman'', 24 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' critic [[Adrian Searle]], "the works the BAFC made during the 80s and early 1990s are almost shocking in their range.... The collective was heavily informed by film and psychoanalytic theory, by political discussion and debate.... Perhaps the most significant achievement of the group was the formulation of a poetic, a tone of voice, a particular kind of filmic space that resisted categorisation."&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;Adrian Searle, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/27/art.features "Voices of the rising tide"], ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Kodwo Eshun]], they "projected a stance of high seriousness with seductive stylishness".&lt;ref name=Searle /&gt;

BAFC produced what the [[British Film Institute]] identifies as "some of the most challenging and experimental documentaries in Britain in the 1980s".&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;Paul Ward, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/502424/ "Black Audio Film Collective (1982-98)"], BFScreenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among their oeuvre is 1986's ''[[Handsworth Songs]]'', a [[essay#film|film essay]] that makes unconventional use of newsreel and archive material of the [[1985 Handsworth riots|autumn 1985 civil disturbances in Birmingham]] and London to explore memories of immigration and the different ways in which race was experienced and British society dealt with the black presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbohp.org.uk/node/20 "Handsworth Songs.

'''Bojnice Castle''' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Bojnický zámok'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Bajmóci vár'') is a [[medieval]] [[castle]] in [[Bojnice]], [[Slovakia]]. It is a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] castle with some original [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] elements built in the 12th century. Bojnice Castle is one of the most visited castles in Slovakia, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors every year and also being a popular filming stage for [[fantasy]] and [[fairy-tale]] movies.

== History ==
Bojnice Castle was first mentioned in written records in 1013, in a document held at the [[Zobor Abbey]]. Originally built as a wooden fort, it was gradually replaced by stone, with the outer walls being shaped according to the uneven rocky terrain. Its first owner was [[Matthew III Csák]], who received it in 1302 from the King [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Ladislaus V]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. Later, in the 15th century, it was owned by King [[Matthias Corvinus]], who gave it to his illegitimate son [[John Corvinus]] in 1489. Matthias liked to visit Bojnice and it was here that he worked on his royal decrees. He used to dictate them under his beloved linden tree, which is now known as the "Linden tree of King Matthias". After his death the castle became the property of the Zápolya family (see [[János Szapolyai|John Zápolya]]). The [[Thurzó]]s, the richest family in the northern Kingdom of Hungary, acquired the castle in 1528 and undertook its major reconstruction. The former fortress was turned into a [[Renaissance]] castle. From 1646 on, the castle's owners were the Pálffys, who continued to rebuild the castle.

Finally, the last famous castle owner from the Pálffy family, Count [[János Ferenc Pálffy]] (1829-1908), made a complex romantic reconstruction from 1888 to 1910 and created today's beautiful imitation of [[France|French]] castles of the [[Loire]] valley. He not only had the castle built, but also was the architect and graphic designer. He utilized his fine artistic taste and love for collecting pieces of art. He was one of the greatest collectors of antiques, tapestries, drawings, paintings and sculptures of his time. After his death and long quarrels, his heirs sold many precious pieces of art from the castle and then, on 25 February 1939, sold the castle, the health spa, and the surrounding land to [[Czechs|Czech]] entrepreneur [[Jan Antonín Baťa]] (owner the shoe company [[Bata Shoes|Bata]]).

After 1945, when Bata's property was confiscated by the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government, the castle became the seat of several state institutions. On 9 May 1950, a huge fire broke out in the castle, but it was rebuilt at government expense. After this reconstruction, a museum specializing in the documentation and presentation of the era of architectural neo-styles was opened here. Bojnice Museum is now part of the Slovak National Museum today.

== Description ==
The castle is renowned for its attractions, including the popular Castle Fairytale, the International Festival of Ghosts and Spirits and the Summer Music Festival. The romantic castle is also a popular location for filming fairy tale movies, such as ''[[Fantaghirò]]''. In 2006, the castle attracted about 200,000 visitors. It hosts the single most popular museum in Slovakia and has featured in many movies{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

[[File:Comtat d'Empúries.svg|thumb|upright|Location of the County of Empúries within the [[Principality of Catalonia]]]]
The '''County of Empúries''' ({{lang-ca|Comtat d'Empúries}}, {{IPA-ca|kumˈtad dəmˈpuɾiəs|IPA}}), also known as the '''County of Ampurias''' ({{lang-es|Condado de Ampurias}}),&lt;ref&gt;Both derive from the Latin ''comitatus Emporiarum''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a medieval county centred on the town of [[Empúries]] and enclosing the Catalan region of [[Peralada]]. It corresponds to the historic ''[[comarca]]'' of [[Empordà]]. 

After the [[Franks]] conquered the regions in 785, Empúries and Peralada came under the authority of the [[County of Girona]]. Around 813, Empúries, with Peralada, became a separate county under [[Ermenguer]]. He and the other early counts were probably of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] origin. In 817, Empúries was merged with the [[County of Roussillon]], a union which lasted until 989. One of the ninth-century counts of Empúries assembled a fleet powerful enough to conquer the [[Balearic Islands]], but only for a brief time.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Runyan (1985), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; From 835 to 844, [[Sunyer I of Empúries|Sunyer I]] ruled Empúries and Peralada while [[Alaric I of Roussillon|Alaric I]] ruled Roussillon and [[Vallespir]]. 

At the death of [[Gausfred I]] in 989, Roussillon and Empúries were separated. Gausfred's elder son [[Hugh I, Count of Empúries|Hugh I]] received Empúries while [[Giselbert I of Roussillon|Giselbert I]] received Roussillon. Hugh's comital dynasty lasted until 1322, when Empúries passed to a collateral branch of his family. The last count, [[Hugh VI, Count of Empúries|Hugh VI]], sold the county to [[Peter IV of Ribagorza]] in 1325 in exchange for the barony of [[Pego, Alicante|Pego]] and the towns of [[Xaló]] and [[Laguar]], all located within the [[Kingdom of Valencia]]. Peter later traded it with [[Raymond Berengar, Count of Empúries|Ramon Berenguer d'Aragona]] for the county of [[Prades, Baix Camp|Prades]] in 1341. From that point on, Empúries was an [[apanage]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In a letter of December 1002, [[Pope Sylvester II]] confirmed the county of Empúries and the "county of Pedralbes" as a part of the [[diocese of Girona]]. The latter is probably to be identified with the Peralada region in the north of Empúries. A portion of the "taxes of the port", consisting of dues and anchorage, were passed on to the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Letter 260 in Lattin (1961), 356–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">The '''criterion of dissimilarity''' (also called '''criterion of discontinuity''')&lt;ref&gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by Thomas P. Rausch (Jul 1, 2003) {{ISBN|0814650783}} page 36&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Biblical criticism]] to determine if a statement attributed to Jesus may be authentic. It is often used as a shorthand for the '''criterion of double dissimilarity'''.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 &gt;''The Historical Jesus and the Final Judgment Sayings in Q'' (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament) by Brian Han Gregg (Jun 30, 2006) {{ISBN|3161487508}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The criterion states that if a saying attributed to Jesus is different from the Jewish traditions of his time and also from the early Church that followed him, it is likely to be authentic.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 /&gt;

==Description==

The criterion of dissimilarity was introduced by [[Ernst Käsemann]], who in 1953 started the second [[quest for the historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name=GerdD122&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) {{ISBN|0664225373}} page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Käsemann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]here is an almost complete lack of satisfactory and water-tight criteria for this material. In only one case do we have more or less safe ground under our feet: when there are no grounds either for deriving a tradition from Judaism or for ascribing it to primitive Christianity, and especially when Jewish Christianity has mitigated or modified the received tradition, as having been too bold for its taste. (Käsemann, ''Essays on New Testament Themes'', p. 37)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tim Widowfield, [http://vridar.org/2014/04/23/defending-the-criterion-of-dissimilarity/ "Defending the criterion of dissimilarity"] (''Vridar'' blog post), 2014-04-23. Retrieved 2017-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the criterion postulates that traditions about Jesus derive from (only) three sources: extrapolation from earlier Jewish traditions, revisionism by the early Christian Church, and true historical accounts of Jesus's ministry. If some tradition cannot be adequately explained by extrapolation nor by revisionism, then it must necessarily be a trace of the historical Jesus.

== Limitations ==

The criterion has received criticism for leading to reconstructions of Jesus as being in implausible discontinuity with the early Jewish traditions that preceded him and the early Christian traditions that followed from him. One such critic writes: "The problem of the Criterion of Double Dissimilarity is that the more we know about early Jewish traditions and the more we know about early Christian post-Easter traditions, the less space there is for a reconstruction of the authentic sayings of Jesus, as by definition they have to differ from early Jewish and early Christian traditions. Therefore, in the end, no trace of a historical Jesus remains."&lt;ref&gt;Oegema, Gerbern S. ''Apocalyptic Interpretation of the Bible''. 2012. pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism of the criterion of dissimiliarity was identified by [[Richard Carrier]]. He identifies two fundamental flaws in the validity of the criterion:

# We are severely limited in our ability to know fundamental details about [[Second Temple Judaism|second-temple Judaism]] and the early Christian church due to an almost total destruction and neglect of documentary records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/747547724|title=The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research : previous discussion and new proposals|last=1956-|first=Porter, Stanley E.,|date=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=9780567520982|location=Sheffield, England|oclc=747547724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tuckett concurs: "The very existence of the tradition may thus mitigate against its being regarded as 'dissimilar' to the views of 'the early church.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60362885|title=The Cambridge companion to Jesus|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Bockmuehl, Markus N. A.|isbn=0521792614|location=Cambridge|oclc=60362885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is no valid method for distinguishing between a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was actually said and a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was invented by later authors. Any motivation to preserve a dissimilar statement is also motivation to invent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/764387191|title=Proving history : Bayes's theorem and the quest for the historical Jesus|last=1969-|first=Carrier, Richard,|date=2012|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781616145590|location=Amherst, N.Y.|oclc=764387191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Criticism===
Bose's study has been criticized by various indian historians and academics for numerous inaccuracies and excessive reliance on Pakistani military and government sources, thereby giving a low estimate of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergman|first1=David|title=Questioning an iconic number|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/questioning-an-iconic-number/article5940833.ece|accessdate=28 September 2016|agency=The Hindu|issue=1|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have accused her of flawed and biased methodology, [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] and downplaying&lt;ref name=BhaumikBook&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhaumik|first=Subir|title=Book, film greeted with fury among Bengalis|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/04/2011429174141565122.html|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=aljazeera|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|war crimes]].&lt;ref name=SahgalDisappearing&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|newspaper=The Daily Star|title=Dead Reckoning: Disappearing stories and evidence|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=214510|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Flying_Blind.pdf Naeem Mohaiemen, "Flying Blind: Waiting for a real Reckoning on 1971", Economic &amp; Political Weekly, vol xlvi no 36, September 3, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Bose_and_Naeem.pdf Sarmila Bose, "‘Dead Reckoning’: A Response"; Naeem Mohaiemen, "Another Reckoning"; Economic &amp; Political Weekly, vol xlvi no 53, December 31, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyStarThoughts&gt;{{cite news |last=Zeitlin |first=Arnold |date=17 November 2013 |title=Thoughts on Dead Reckoning |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-214413  |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, she misquoted her interviewees and other academics that she cites as reference.&lt;ref name=DailyStarFlying&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohaimen|first=Naeem|title=Flying Blind: Waiting for a Real Reckoning on 1971|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=205005|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose has been criticised for her bias towards Pakistani Army in the language she deploys – Bangladeshi accounts are labelled "claims", Pakistani officers' accounts are straightforward accounts.&lt;ref name=ButaliaTehelka&gt;{{cite news|last=Butalia|first=Urvashi|title=She Does Not Know Best|url=http://www.tehelka.com/she-does-not-know-best/|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Tehelka|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose's impartiality has also been questioned due to her role as an advocate of US arms sales to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=SundayGuardianBose&gt;{{cite news|last=Sobhan|first=Zafar|title=Bose is more Pakistani than Jinnah the Quaid|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/bose-is-more-pakistani-than-jinnah-the-quaid|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mookherjee|first=Nayanika|newspaper=The Guardian|title=This account of the Bangladesh war should not be seen as unbiased|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/bangladesh-liberation-war-sarmila-bose|date=7 June 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DhakaDebacle&gt;{{cite news|last=Raghavan|first=Srinath|title=A Dhaka Debacle|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-dhaka-debacle/824484|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=30 July 2011|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExpressReading&gt;{{cite news|last=Zia|first=Afia|title=Reading and writing 1971|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/319980/reading-and-writing-1971/|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NasirReturn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2011/03/14/return-of-sarmila-bose/|title=Return of Sarmila Bose|last=Nasir|first=ABM|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=bdnews24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSMonitorRight&gt;{{cite news|last=Milam|first=William|title=The right stuff: F-16s to Pakistan is wise decision|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0411/p09s02-coop.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=11 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Srinath Raghavan]], the author of ''1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh'', calls Bose's book a "disturbing misrepresentation of the 1971 war"&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-dhaka-debacle&lt;/ref&gt; and further writes that "it is impossible to review the entire catalogue of evasions, obfuscations, omissions and methodological errors that suffuses the book".&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-dhaka-debacle/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minimization of rapes ====

The most severe criticisms against Bose report that Bose's claims that allegations of genocide and rape by the [[Pakistan Army]] were exaggerated by [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson Center [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/book-event-idead-reckoning-memories-the-1971-bangladesh-wari Woodrow Wilson Center Book Launch event]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Anatomy_of_Violence_-_Analysis_of_Civil_War_in_East_Pakistan_n_1971.pdf Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971] by Sarmila Bose in the [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 8 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bricklanecircle.org/uploads/Losing_the_vitctims_-_Problems_of_Using_Women_as_Weapons_in_Recounting_the_Bangladesh_War.pdf Losing the Victims: Problems of Using Women as Weapons in Recounting the Bangladesh War] by Sarmila Bose in the [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 22 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She is alleged to have presented selective interviews of witnesses in favour of her opinions.&lt;ref name="SahgalDisappearing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NasirReturn" /&gt;

Bose has been criticized long before publishing the book for her research methodologies. She accepts the statement of Pakistani Brigadier Taj that no women were tortured in [[Rajarbagh|Rajarbag]] to be true even though Taj was not present during the operation. But she invalidates the testimony of an eye witness of the incidents of rape done by Pakistani Army as the witness is illiterate. In another case, she asserted that since one rape victim feared for her life, she must have consented to having sex with Pakistani soldiers.&lt;ref name="MashuqurContinuing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rahman|first=Mashuqur|title=The continuing rape of our history|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2007/december/rape.htm|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bose's book implies a claim to being the 'first' to dissect the death toll of 3 million in 1971, Zunaid Kazi had already documented 12 different media estimates of death tolls.&lt;ref name="LawsonControversial" /&gt;

'''Dunajská Streda''' ({{lang-sk|Dunajská Streda}}, {{IPA-sk|ˈdunajskaː ˈstrɛda|pron|Sk-Dunajskastreda.ogg}}; {{lang-hu|Dunaszerdahely}}; {{lang-de|Niedermarkt}}; {{lang-he|סרדאהלי}}) is a [[town]] in southern [[Slovakia]] ([[Trnavský kraj]]). Dunajská Streda is the most important town of the [[Žitný ostrov]] area. It has a Hungarian ethnic majority and its population is 22,477 (2011 census)

==Name==
The name of ''Syridahel'' was first mentioned in 1256. Other early orthographic forms of the name were ''Zeredahely'' (1270) and ''Zredahel'' (1358). Szerdahely means "Wednesday (market)place" in Hungarian and it indicates the town had the privilege to hold a market on Wednesdays (although it was later changed to Fridays). (The Hungarian word ''szerda'' is a loanword from [[Slavs|Slavic]] languages; the word ''streda'' means Wednesday for example in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], with related words existing in other Slavic languages, as it is the middle (''stred'') day in the week.) The attribute ''Duna-'' (''Dunajská''; i.e. [[Danube|Danubian]]) was added in the 19th century to distinguish it from other towns with similar names (in accordance with the "one town, one name" policy of [[Austria-Hungary]]). The German name ''Niedermarkt'' means "Lower Market".

==History==
According to archeological evidence the territory was inhabited in the Neolithic, Bronze, Roman and Great Moravian period. The region was part of the arising [[Principality of Hungary|Hungarian state]] since the 10th century.

In the Middle and Modern Ages the settlement was a little market town in the southern part of [[Bratislava county|Pozsony county]] and a commercial and administrative centre for the neighbouring villages. After 1808, after 1854, and in 1960 it was amalgamated with several smaller settlements.

The population of the town has been predominantly [[Magyars|Hungarian]] at least since the late Middle Ages. The first detailed description of the territory of the town is a charter of King [[Charles I of Hungary]] from 1341 when the king gave the estate of ''Pókafölde'' to [[comes]] Tamás. In the middle of the 15th century Szerdahely became an ''oppidum'', or market town. The first conscription of the population happened in 1574 (26 royal serf families and 3 noble families). The next conscription in 1646 indicates that most citizen were craftsmen. The town was under the feudal jurisdiction of the [[Pálffy]] family between 1600 and 1848. Many [[Jews]] came in the 18th century. In 1880 the town had 4182 inhabitants out of which were 3,531 Hungarian and 416 [[ethnic Germans|German]] by mother tongue. The number of the Jewish population was 1,874. In 1910 there were 4,679 Hungarian by mother tongue from a total 4,762. In 1930, the town had 5,706 inhabitants, including 2,944 Hungarians, 2,186 Jews (mostly Hungarian-speaking) and 503 Slovaks. According to the 2001 census, 18,756 [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], 3,588 [[Slovaks]], 353 [[Romani people]], 147 [[Czech people|Czechs]] and 24 [[Germans]] live in the city, meaning a Hungarian majority of over 80%, one of the highest proportions of any municipality in the country.

===After WWI===
In 1919 the town became part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. It was ceded to [[Hungary]] once again by the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938, but was returned to Czechoslovakia in 1945 after [[World War II]]. On June 15, 1944 2,970 Jews from Dunajska Streda and vicinity were sent on a transport to Auschwitz. 

In 1947-48, a portion of the town's Hungarian population was expelled to Hungary in accordance with Czechoslovakia's policies based on [[collective guilt]] and later by the [[Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange]]. These people also had their Czechoslovak citizenship and all their [[Estate (law)|estates]] and [[Personal property|movables]] forfeited by the Czechoslovak state.

===After WWII===
During the [[communist]] era the town underwent rapid modernization and [[industrialization]], which has left over 85% of the city's historical center demolished and replaced with [[Socialist realism|social-realist]] concrete buildings typical of the era. This has also caused the city to lose its previous character. In the 1990s the center of the town was totally rebuilt and revitalized according to the plans of [[Imre Makovecz]], a Hungarian architect of the "organic" school. Today, it is one of the centers of the Hungarian national community in Slovakia and is the fastest growing city of southern Slovakia.

==Sights==
* The [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] Church of St. George was founded in 1010, and rebuilt 1329; in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style in 1541. It was rebuilt again in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style in 1742-43. In front of the church there is a memorial for the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian Revolution]] in 1848-49.
* The [[Protestantism|Evangelical]] Church was built in 1863-83 in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Revival style. There is a new [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Church (1996) next door.
* The Jewish [[Synagogue]] was destroyed by a bomb in 1945, and the ruins were knocked down in 1955. There is a [[Holocaust Memorial]] (1991) on the lot today.
* The Yellow Castle was built by Márton Biró of Padányi in 1753, and was rebuilt in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style in the 19th century. Today it is the home of the Csallóköz Museum.
* [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] town hall and commercial centre by Imre Makovecz.

==Coat-of-arms==
The 19th century seal of the market town depicted St Peter with the inscription "''Sigillum Oppidi Szerdahely''". According to the tradition the old coat-of-arms of the town depicted this figure in blue clothes, in a green field, on a silver shield, but it is disputed whether it was a real coat-of-arms or only a seal symbol. In 1910 the town applied to the State Municipality Registration Committee for a new seal without any picture (inscription: "''Pozsony vármegye Dunaszerdahely község 1910''"). After that the St Peter figure was finally dropped from the municipal symbols.

[[File:Dunajská Streda - erb.svg|70px|left]] The modern symbol of the town is a talking coat-of-arms: "''a split shield with the right field five times divided by blue and gold and with the left red field with the gold sign of Wednesday (Mercurius’ symbol).''" The six stripes on the right symbolize the six villages amalgamated in the course of history to compose the modern town. The blue and gold colours refer to the river Danube and the large wheatfields of the region. The antique Mercurius/Wednesday symbol refer to the old Wednesday markets which gave the name of the town.

==Demographics (2011 census)==
[[File:Dunajska Streda-Jewish Holocaust Memorial.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Jewish Holocaust memorial in the center of the town. Before the [[Holocaust]] about half of the town's population was [[Jewish]]. The memorial is shaped as a torn out [[Tablets of Stone]], and was erected where the main town's [[synagogue]] was located.]]
According to the 2011 census, from 22,477 inhabitants there were 74.53% Hungarians, 19.46% Slovaks, 2.77% Roma and 0.51% Czechs. The religious make-up was 67.67% Roman Catholics,  11.57% with no religious affiliation, 7,19 Calvinist, 1.67% Lutherans and others.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;[http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html Mestská a obecná štatistika SR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223415/http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html |date=January 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, 50.2% of the population was Roman Catholic, 43.6% Jewish and 3.5% Calvinist.

==Education==
There are Slovak and Hungarian language secondary schools in the town, called Gymnázium s vyučovacím jazykom slovenským and Vámbéry Ármin Magyar Tanítási Nyelvű Gimnázium.

==Ethnic tensions==
In June 1887 the synagogue was set on fire  and 64 most Jewish buildings in the city. In the same year the Jewish quarter was sacked and hooligans attacked Jews in the street and their homes. Not until military units were alerted did the attacks stop. The damage was heavy and about 80 Jewish families were left homeless.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

May 1944, Jewish males under the age of 48 were drafted to work squads in different areas. On that same date the order to establish a ghetto in Dunajska Streda was issued. Three streets on the Eastern side of the synagogue were set aside for the Jewish population. Within 48 hours all the Jews in town had to leave their houses and move into the ghetto that was run by officers of the Hungarian army. Immediately upon leaving their houses army personnel and town residents broke into them and looted the possessions that were left behind. In the middle of May 1944 Jews from about 70 towns, including Samorin and Magendorf, were sent to the Ghetto too. 
On June 8, 1944 came the announcement of the evacuation from the ghetto. The first stage was assembling all the Jews in the synagogue building and courtyard, and several days later the actual deportation began.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A 2008 soccer match between [[FC Dunajska Streda]] and [[ŠK Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]] was disrupted by Slovak riot police after only 15 minutes injuring more than 60 people, many of whom lost consciousness or suffered injuries including concussion and broken jaws.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/9883/213/|title=Hungarians attacked|last=Leitner|first=Attila|date=2008-11-10|work=[[The Budapest Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-17}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local policemen stormed Hungarian nationals, who were at the game to support the home team and to protest the burning of a Hungarian flag at an earlier game.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; flags with [[Árpád stripes]], favoured by the extreme right in Hungary, were being waved and the home crowd sang the [[Hungarian national anthem]] before kickoff.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;
Press reports from the scene said that the police failed to act against Bratislava supporters who were throwing smoke bombs, noise grenades and other missiles on the pitch.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Based on videos posted on the internet showing the incident from various angles the supporters were not doing anything that would warrant such an intervention by police.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Five days after the game the Slovak police presented a photo as evidence, showing one of the supporters raising his fist to throw a punch, but police officers can not be seen on the image.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Spontaneous demonstrations were held in [[Budapest]] at the embassy and the consulate of Slovakia on the night of the incident.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Protesters lit candles to honor the victims and burned a Slovak flag.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

The '''Folkton Drums''' are a unique set of decorated chalk objects in the shape of [[Drum (container)|drums]] or solid cylinders dating from the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] period. Found in a child's grave near the village of [[Folkton]] in northern England, they are now on loan to Stonehenge Visitor Centre from the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_folkton_drums.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1889, a round prehistoric [[tumulus|barrow]] was opened by the scholar and amateur archaeologist [[William Greenwell]] near [[Folkton]] in [[North Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=north&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=John|title=Stonehenge : a new interpretation of prehistoric man and the cosmos|date=1996|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1416576460|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1416576460|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, he found a neolithic grave dating to the time of [[Stonehenge]], estimated to be between 2600 and 2000 BC. The remains of several bodies were unearthed, one of whom was a child beside which the three drums were found. The rarity of this find (no other similar artifact is known from Europe) suggests that the child came from an elite group in society. Four years after the discovery, the drums were donated by Greenwell, along with other parts of his collection, to the British Museum.

==Description==
The three drum-like forms are made of chalk (that was quarried locally) and are decorated with stylized human faces and [[geometric]] patterns. On the top of the cylinders are a series of concentric circles and two of them have pairs of eyes that [[schematic]]ally denote a human face. The design of the drums is similar to objects made in the [[Beaker culture]] and early [[bronze age]]. The purpose of the drums is unknown, although the faces may represent important members of the local clan or they may be a type of children's [[toy]] that has uniquely survived, when most would have been made of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=The+Folkton+Drums|title=The Folkton Drums|last=|first=|date=|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">The '''Fon creation myth''' is the traditional [[creation myth|creation story]] of the [[Fon people]]s of [[West Africa]].  Various versions of the creation story are told. In most the creator is either [[Mawu]], the moon being and mother of all the gods and humanity, or [[Mawu|Mawu-Lisa]], the sun/moon being who is both male and female.  In others, [[Nana Buluku]] is the ultimate creator, an [[androgyny|androgynous]] deity who gave birth to the female Mawu and the male Lisa and passed the power over creation to them.

Many of the creation accounts tell of Mawu creating everything as she was carried from place to place on the back or in the mouth of [[Ayida-Weddo|Aido Hwedo]], the rainbow serpent.  The earth was created first, its curves, slopes and rises shaped by the winding, snaking motions of Aido Hwedo. Mountains formed from Aido Hwedo's excrement wherever they stopped to rest, leaving precious minerals inside.  When Mawu finished, all of the mountains, trees, elephants and other creations left world too heavy, so she asked Aido Hwedo to coil, to encircle the earth and rest underneath to support its weight.

Aido Hwedo holds his own tail in his mouth to hold fast to the earth, and rests in the cool of the seas which Mawu made for him to protect him from the heat. Mawu's son, Agbe, now commands them. Whenever Aido Hwedo shifts or readjusts his position, he causes an earthquake or tidal wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Courlander|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Fynes Clinton''' (14 January 1781 &amp;ndash; 24 October 1852) was an [[England|English]] [[classical scholar]], [[chronologist]] and [[Member of Parliament]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Gamston, Bassetlaw|Gamston]], [[Nottinghamshire]], the eldest son of Rev. Charles Fynes, prebendary of Westminster and perpetual curate of St. Margaret’s, Westminster. For some generations his family bore the name of Fynes, but his father resumed the older family name of Clinton in 1821. Henry was educated at [[Southwell Minster School|Southwell Grammar School]], [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he studied classical literature and history. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1808 to study law.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/fynes-henry-1781-1852|title=FYNES (afterwards FYNES CLINTON), Henry (1781-1852), of Welwyn House, Herts. and Dean's Yard, Westminster, Mdx.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 12 May 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1806 to 1826 he was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aldborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldborough]].

He died at [[Welwyn]], [[Hertfordshire|Herts]], where he had purchased the residence and estate of the poet [[Edward Young]]. He had married twice; firstly Harriott, the daughter of Rev. Charles Wylde of Nottingham
and secondly Katherine, the daughter of Rt. Rev. [[Henry William Majendie]], Bishop of Bangor. They had 2 sons who predeceased their father and 9 daughters.

==Works==
His reading was methodical (see his ''Literary Remains''). His ''Fasti'', on classical chronology, has required correction on the basis of later research.

His major works are: 

* ''Fasti Hellenici, the Civil and Literary Chronology of Greece from the 55th to the 124th Olympiad'' (1824–1851), including dissertations on points of Greek history and Scriptural chronology; and
* ''Fasti Romani, the Civil and Literary Chronology of Rome and Constantinople from the Death of Augustus to the Death of Heraclius'' (1845–1850).

In 1851 and 1853 respectively he published epitomes of the above. ''The Literary Remains of H. F. Clinton'' (the first part of which contains an autobiography written in 1818) were edited by [[Clinton James Fynes Clinton]] in 1854.

[[Encyclopedia]]s have progressed from the beginning of history in written form, through medieval and modern times in print, and most recently, displayed on computer and distributed via computer networks.

==Ancient times==
Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years.

===Marcus Terentius Varro===
[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|ə|s|_|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ʃ|ə|s|_|ˈ|v|æ|r|oʊ}}; 116 BC – 27 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] scholar and writer.

His ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' became a model for later [[encyclopedists]], especially [[Pliny the Elder]].  The most noteworthy portion of the ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' is its use of the [[liberal arts]] as organizing principles.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Western Science |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-48205-7 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], [[musical theory]], [[medicine]], and [[architecture]].  Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical "liberal arts of the medieval schools".&lt;ref name=Lindberg/&gt;

===Pliny the Elder===
[[Image:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiæ'', 1669 edition, title page]]
The earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the [[1st century AD]]. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering [[natural history]], architecture, medicine, [[geography]], geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77-79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.&lt;ref name=naturalis&gt;Naturalis Historia&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, many barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one Greek who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also elaborates on the difficulties of writing such a work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This work became very popular in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], and survived, with many copies being made and distributed in the western world. It was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, and especially [[Roman art]], [[Roman technology]] and [[Roman engineering]]. It is also a recognised source for [[medicine]], [[art]], [[mineralogy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[geology]] and many other topics not discussed by other classical authors. Among many interesting entries are those for the [[elephant]] and the [[murex]] snail, the much sought-after source of [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;

Although his work has been criticized for the lack of candor in checking the "facts", some of his text has been confirmed by recent research, like the spectacular remains of Roman [[gold mines]] in [[Spain]], especially at [[Las Médulas]], which Pliny probably saw in operation while a [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] there a few years before he compiled the encyclopedia. Although many of the [[mining]] methods are now redundant, such as [[hushing]] and [[fire-setting]], it is Pliny who recorded them for posterity, thereby helping us understand their importance in a modern context. Pliny makes clear the fact in the preface to his work that he had checked his facts by reading and comparing the works of others, as well as referring to them by name. Many such books are now [[lost works]] and remembered only by his references, much like the lost sources mentioned in the work of [[Vitruvius]] a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Etymologiae Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|First printed edition of 1472 (by Guntherus Zainer, [[Augsburg]]), title page of book 14 (''de terra et partibus''), illustrated with a [[T and O map]].]]
The work ''De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'' ("About the wedding of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and Philologia") written by [[Martianus Capella]] (4th-5th century) was very influential on the successive medieval encyclopedias. It consists in a complete encyclopedia of classical erudition. It firstly introduced the division and classification of the seven [[liberal arts]] ([[trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]), followed by many successive works along the [[Middle Ages]].

The first Christian encyclopedia were the ''Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum'' of [[Cassiodorus]] (543-560), which were divided in two parts: the first one dealt with Christian Divinity; the second one described the seven liberal arts.

Saint [[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized as being the author of the first known encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The encyclopedia has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had they not been collected by Saint Isidore.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830, which was based on ''Etymologiae''.

Many encyclopedic works were written during the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th centuries]]. Among them, ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' (1167–1185) by [[Herrad of Landsberg]] which is thought to be the first encyclopedia written by a woman. ''[[De proprietatibus rerum]]'' by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (1240) is often described as the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the [[High Middle Ages]]&lt;ref name="dotma"&gt;See "Encyclopedia" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''[[Speculum Majus]]'' (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the [[Late medieval|late-medieval period]] at over 3 million words.&lt;ref name=dotma/&gt;

The first encyclopedias in vernacular languages were translations or abridgements of works in [[Latin]]. Among them, the most famous is ''Li livre dou Trésor'', written in [[French language|French]] by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Brunetto Latini]]. It is mainly based on the ''Speculum Majus''. The works by the [[Flemish]] [[Jacob van Maerlant]], as a whole, are regarded as an encyclopedia. These works, too, are based on former Latin texts.

=== Byzantine encyclopedias ===

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedias were compendia of information about both [[Ancient Greece|Ancient]] and Byzantine Greece. The first of them was the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' written by the [[patriarch]] [[Photius]] (9th century).

The ''[[Suda]]'' or Souda (Greek: Σοῦδα) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic [[lexicon]], written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers.

===Arabic and Persian===
The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]]&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt; were engaged in their [[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]. Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose [[Muqaddimah]] contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

These scholars have influenced methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of [[isnad]] which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} An acquisition of knowledge it was believed not only enlightened the mind but also led to a greater appreciation of God. To be remarkable during these times was to keep pace with the ‘march of intellect’ and the printing press became a necessity for the widespread dissemination of this commodity called knowledge. As a means of cultural production, the printing press was the very embodiment of the ideal of ‘Enlightenment’.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Savithri Preetha.

===India===

[[Varāhamihira]]'s (505–587 CE) [[Brihat Samhita]] ("large compilation") is an encyclopedic work, not only dealing with astrology but also rainfall, clouds, water-divination, intentions and characteristics of animals, perfumes, erotic recipes, pimples, temples, architecture and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita|author=M.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese encyclopedia}}
The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1,000 written volumes. There were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) with his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, the statesman, inventor, and agronomist [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (active 1290–1333) with his ''Nong Shu'' of 1313, and the written ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' of [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666), the latter of whom was termed the "[[Denis Diderot|Diderot of China]]" by British historian [[Joseph Needham]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 102"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] oversaw the compilation of the ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'', one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 370 million Chinese characters in 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 remain today. In the succeeding [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Qianlong Emperor]] personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays, called the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' which is probably the largest collection of books in the world. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, ''Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea'' to a Western-style title for all knowledge. Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the 9th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Renaissance==
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&lt;ref name="dotma"/&gt;

During  the [[Renaissance]],  the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy.

The ''De expetendis et fugiendis rebus'' by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated.

The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.

Much encyclopaedism of the [[French Renaissance]] was based upon the notion of not including every fact known to humans, but only that knowledge that was necessary, where necessity was judged by a wide variety of criteria, leading to works of greatly varying sizes. [[Béroalde de Verville]] laid the foundation for his encyclopaedic works in a [[hexameral poem]] entitled ''Les cognoissances nécessaires'' for example. Often, the criteria had moral bases, such as in the case of [[Pierre de La Primaudaye]]'s ''L'Académie française'' and Guillaume Telin's ''Bref sommaire des sept vertus &amp;c.''. Encyclopaedists encountered several problems with this approach, including how to decide what to omit as unnecessary, how to structure knowledge that resisted structure (often simply as a consequence of the sheer amount of material that deserved inclusion), and how to cope with the influx of newly discovered knowledge and the effects that it had on prior structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Palace of Secrets: Beroalde de Verville and Renaissance Conceptions of Knowledge|author=Neil Kenny|pages=12–13|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-815862-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term encyclopaedia was coined by 15th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words "''enkyklios paideia''" into one word. The phrase ''enkyklios paideia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Enciclopedia came from him.&lt;br&gt;The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]], specifically employed the word ''encyclopaedia'' for the first time in English{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' or ''Vulgar Errors'', a series of refutations of common errors of his age. Browne structured his encyclopedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers, for throughout the late 17th century and early 18th century it was translated. For many years it was thought incompatible with the French and Dutcheze, into the French, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and German languages as well as [[Latin]].

==18th–19th centuries==
[[Image:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'', 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of Diderot and D'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".

[[Image:1708-harris-ttlpg.jpg|left|thumb|Harris' ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'', title page of 2nd edition, 1708]]

[[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English ''Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves'' – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science—and conformably to the broad 18th-century understanding of the term 'science', its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today, and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts, e.g. a substantial number from law, commerce, music, and heraldry. At about 1,200 pages, its scope can be considered as more that of an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Ephraim Chambers]] published his ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopædia]]'' in 1728. It included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles. Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two-volume work.

A French translation of Chambers' work inspired the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. The ''Encyclopédie'' was edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772. Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by [[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' represented the essence of the [[French Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Stephen J. Gendzier (1967), cited in Hillmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot, in his [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;idno=did2222.0000.004;rgn=main;view=text ''Encyclopédie'' article of the same name], went further: "to collect all the knowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known its general structure to the men among we live, and to transmit it to those who will come after us", to make men not only wiser but also "more virtuous and more happy."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot, ''Rameau's Nephew and Other Works'', trans. and ed. Jacques Barzun and Ralph H. Bowen (1956), cited in Himmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the inherent problems with the model of knowledge he had created, Diderot's view of his own success in writing the ''Encyclopédie'' were far from ecstatic. Diderot envisioned the perfect encyclopedia as more than the sum of its parts. In his own article on the encyclopedia, Diderot also wrote, "Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements." Diderot viewed the ideal encyclopedia as an index of connections. He realized that all knowledge could never be amassed in just one large work, but he hoped the relations among the subjects could be.

The ''Encyclopédie'' in turn inspired the venerable ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes – A–B, C–L, and M–Z – with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects.

The German-language ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' was published at [[Leipzig]] from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, its scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century encyclopedias, the ''Conversations-Lexikon'' is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias.

[[File:eclairage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical custom-made encyclopedia engraving by [[Maurice Dessertenne]] for the ''Nouveau Larousse illustré'' (France, 1898–1907)]]
The early years of the 19th century saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' (1802–19) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like [[Wilson Lowry]] of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like [[John Farey, Jr.]] Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The [[Bulgarian National Revival|National Revival]] of [[Bulgaria]], influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], resulted in [[Petar Beron]]'s ''[[Primer with Various Instructions]]'' (also known as the ''Fish Primer'') in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic [[arithmetics]], [[zoology]] and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulgaria: historical and geographical outline|last=Todorov|first=Nikolai|year=1968|page=263|location=Sofia|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fxidT834J_LZ4QTM7d2pDg&amp;hl=bg&amp;id=zXlpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fish+primer+beron+bulgarian+encyclopedia+-april&amp;q=fish+primer+beron+encyclopedia+-april}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beron later published a 7-volume work in natural sciences known as ''[[Panepisteme]]'' in 1867.

The 17-volume ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'' and its supplements were published in France by [[Pierre Larousse]] from 1866 to 1890.

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of [[popular education]] and the [[Mechanics' Institutes]], spearheaded by the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]] led to the production of the ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'', as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a newspaper.

In the early 20th century, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[Everyman's Encyclopaedia]]'' were common.

===International development===
During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.

The first large encyclopedia in Russian, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'' (86 volumes, 1890–1906), was a direct cooperation with the German Brockhaus.

Without such a formal cooperation, the Swedish ''Conversations-lexicon'' (4 volumes, 1821–1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was ''Svenskt konversationslexikon'' (4 volumes, 1845–1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (A–K), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfar/slutord.html Slutord], postscriptum to the 1st edition, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; with two supplement volumes (1896–1899).
[[File:Göttingen-SUB-Encyclopedia.Americana.JPG|thumb|180px|''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' at Göttingen State and University Library.]]
The first major Danish encyclopedia was ''[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon]]'' (19 volumes, 1893–1911).

In Norway, encyclopedias follow the unique history of the [[Norwegian language]], the [[Bokmål]] variant having branched off from Danish during the 19th century. After the national independence in 1905, publisher [[Aschehoug]] (owned by [[William Martin Nygaard]]) hired librarian Haakon Nyhuus to edit ''Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon'' (6 volumes, 1907–1913), in later editions known as ''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon''. In the [[Nynorsk]] variant of the language, ''Norsk Allkunnebok'' (10 volumes, 1948–1966) was the only encyclopedia until the arrival of Wikipedia.

The first major Finnish encyclopedia was ''[[Tietosanakirja]]'' (11 volumes, 1909–1922). Inspired by the minority language example of ''Norsk Allkunnebok'', a Swedish-language encyclopedia of Finland was initiated in 1969 and eventually published as ''[[Uppslagsverket Finland]]'' (3 volumes, 1982–1985; 2nd edition in 5 volumes, 2003–2007). With such a small market, the sales revenue only covered the printing cost, while editors were paid by endowments. In 2009 the entire contents was made available online, free of charge.

Already during [[czarist Russia]]n rule, two editions appeared of the Latvian ''Konversācijas vārdnīca'' (2 volumes, 1891–1893; 4 volumes, 1906–1921). The larger ''Latviešu konversācijas vārdnīca'' (21 volumes, A–Tjepolo, 1927–1940) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. After the war, Latvian emigrants in Sweden published ''Latvju enciklopēdija'' (3 volumes, 1950–1956, with a supplement volume in 1962). Soviet authories published ''Latvijas PSR mazās enciklopēdijas'' (3 volumes, 1967–1970) and ''Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija'' (10 volumes, 1981–1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.lv/encuklopedijas/manualo_enciklopediju_saraksts.htm List of Latvian encyclopedias] from the website Historia.lv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the history of [[Lithuanian encyclopedias]], the ''Lietuviškoji enciklopedija'' (9 volumes A–J, 1933–1941) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. Lithuanian emigrants in the United States published ''Lietuvių enciklopedija'' (35 volumes, 1953–1966). Soviet authorities published ''Mažoji lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (3 volumes, 1966–1971), ''Lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (12 volumes, 1976–1985), and ''[[Encyclopedia of Soviet Lithuania|Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija]]'' (4 volumes, 1985–1988).
First Turkish encyclopedia was Kamus-ül-Ulûm ve’l-Maarif written by Ali Suvai in 1870 after that Ahmet Rifat Efendi's 7 volumes work "Lûgaat-i Tarihiye ve Coğrafiye" (Dictionary of History and Geography) published in Istanbul at 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/ansiklopedi/ |title=Ansiklopedi (encyclopedia) (tr) |publisher=Yeniansiklopedi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|left|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias.]]

Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia]]''.

The second half of the 20th century also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often by means of new works authored by significant researchers. Such encyclopedias included ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition), and ''Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/S04.cws_home/books |title=Economics and Finance – Elsevier |publisher=Elsevier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; series. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including, typically, such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]] and [[African-American history]].

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwblMaEW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an [[academic degree]], and distributed as [[Intellectual property|proprietary]] content.

Encyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, [[copyright infringement]] was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and world views of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, Paul A. "Encyclopedia." World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. [Place of access.] 13 Jan. 2008 &lt;http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Login?ed=wb&amp;tu=%2Fwb%2FArticle%3Fid%3Dar180800&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, old encyclopedias whose [[public domain|copyright has expired]], such as the 1911 edition of ''Britannica'', are also the only [[free content]] English encyclopedias released in print form. However, works such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', which were created in the public domain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} exist as free content encyclopedias in other languages.

===Emergence of free encyclopedias===
{{See also|History of wikis}}
The concept of a new free encyclopedia began with the [[Interpedia]] proposal on [[Usenet]] in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based [[online encyclopedia]] to which anyone could submit content and that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included [[Everything2]] and [[Open Site]]. In 1999, [[Richard Stallman]] proposed the [[GNUPedia]], an online encyclopedia which, similar to the [[GNU operating system]], would be a "generic" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's [[GNU]] philosophy.

It was not until [[Nupedia]] and later Wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet.

==Twenty-first century==
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg|thumb|upright|Wikipedia is one of the first "[[user generated content]]" encyclopedias]]

The English Wikipedia, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxreviews.org/news/2004/07/07_3000k/ "Wikipedia Passes 300,000 Articles making it the worlds largest encyclopedia"], ''Linux Reviews'', 2004 Julich y 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and by late 2005, Wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. As of August 2009, Wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined in over 250 languages. Wikipedia currently has [[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles in English. Since 2003, other free encyclopedias like the Chinese-language [[Baidu Baike]] and [[Hudong]], as well as English language encyclopedias like [[Citizendium]] and [[Knol]] have appeared. Knol has been discontinued.

An encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a [[Digital media|digital format]], and all major printed general encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. [[Disk storage|Disk-based]], typically [[DVD-ROM]] or [[CD-ROM]] format, publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and easily portable. Additionally, they can include [[Electronic media|media]] which are impossible to store in the printed format, such as [[animation]]s, [[sound recording|audio]] and [[video]]. [[Hyperlink]]ing between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit, although even Diderot's encyclopedia had cross-referencing.

On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format, as with a disk- or paper-based publication. Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes ("yearbooks") to update events between editions, as a partial solution to the problem of staying up-to-date, but this of course required the reader to check both the main volumes and the supplemental volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's [[hard disk]] in a manner not possible with a printed encyclopedia.

Information in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However, with the advent of dynamic electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is less necessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organizational strategies for the articles, such as by subject, area, or alphabetically.

Digital encyclopedias also offer greater search abilities than printed versions. While the printed versions rely on indexes to assist in searching for topics, computer accessible versions allow searching through article text for keywords or phrases.

Specialized encyclopedias may offer a more comprehensive content. For example, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ADAM Medical Encyclopedia (which includes over 4,000 articles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries), the Wiki Encyclopedia of Law and the Encyclopedia of Earth all provide a more focused list of topics.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, recent works include the ''Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam'' prepared in 10 volumes by The Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/ |title=Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation. بنیاد دائره المعارف اسلامی |publisher=Encyclopaediaislamica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Islam'' published as a four-volume English encyclopedia including around 1200 entries. Other such works are: the ''Encyclopedia of  Imam Ali'', the ''Encyclopedia of Qur'anology'', and the ''Encyclopedia of Lady Fātima'', all published by the Islamic Research Institute for Culture and Thought (IICT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ency.iict.ac.ir |title=پژوهشكده دانشنامه نگاري – پژوهشکده دانشنامه نگاری دینی |publisher=Ency.iict.ac.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hymn to Enlil''', '''Enlil and the Ekur (Enlil A)''', '''Hymn to the Ekur''', '''Hymn and incantation to Enlil''', '''Hymn to Enlil the all beneficent''' or '''Excerpt from an exorcism''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s in the late third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Ángel Borrás|author2=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|title=Joan Goodrick Westenholz, The Foundation Myths of Mesopotamian Cities: Divine Planners and Human Builder in "La fundación de la ciudad: mitos y ritos en el mundo antiguo"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yPVFGPr0aoC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2000|publisher=Edicions UPC|isbn=978-84-8301-387-8|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compilation==

Fragments of the text were discovered in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section (CBS) from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. The [[myth]] was first published using tablet CBS 8317, translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 as "Sumerian religious texts" in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]", number ten, entitled "An excerpt from an [[exorcism]]".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|3.4|by|2.75|by|1.2|in|cm}} at its thickest point. A larger fragment of the text was found on CBS tablet number 14152 and first published by Henry Frederick Lutz as "A hymn and incantation to Enlil" in "Selected Sumerian and Babylonian Texts", number 114 in 1919.&lt;ref name="Lutz1919"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Frederick Lutz|title=Selected Sumerian and Babylonian texts, pp. 54-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX5DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1919|publisher=The University Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton's tablet had only containted lines five to twenty four of the reverse of Lutz's, which had already been translated in 1918 and was used to complete several of his damaged lines.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;

[[Edward Chiera]] published tablet CBS 7924B from the hymn in "Sumerian Epics and Myths".&lt;ref name="Chiera1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Chiera|title=Sumerian epics and myths, 102 B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFCPgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] to publish three other tablets CBS 8473, 10226, 13869 in "Sumerian texts of varied contents" in 1934. The name given this time was "Hymn to the [[Ekur]]", suggesting the tablets were "parts of a composition which extols the ekur of Enlil at Nippur, it may, however be only an extract from a longer text".&lt;ref name="ChieraKramer1934"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Chiera|author2=Samuel Noah Kramer|author3=University of Pennsylvania.

Other translations were made from tablets in the Nippur collection of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of the Ancient Orient]] in [[Istanbul]] (Ni). [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] amongst others worked to translate several others from the Istanbul collection including Ni 1039, 1180, 4005, 4044, 4150, 4339, 4377, 4584, 9563 and 9698.&lt;ref name="Kramer1944"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian literary texts from Nippur: in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul, 37 &amp; 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqdIGQAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1944|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CigKizilyay1969"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muazzez Cig|author2=Hatice Kizilyay|title=Sumerian literary tablets and fragments in the archeological museum of Istanbul-I, 68, 1f, 94 &amp; 114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrEnGwAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1969|publisher=Tarih Kurumu Basimevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; More were found at [[Henri de Genouillac]]'s excavations at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (C 53).&lt;ref name="Genouillac1924"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Henri de Genouillac]]|title=Premières recherches archéologiques à Kich: Mission d'Henri de Genouillac 1911 - 1912.

==Composition==

The hymn, noted by Kramer as one of the most important of its type,&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; starts with praise for Enlil in his awe-inspiring dais:

{{cquote|Enlil's commands are by far the loftiest, his words are holy, his utterances are immutable! The fate he decides is everlasting, his glance makes the mountains anxious, his ... reaches into the interior of the mountains. All the gods of the earth bow down to father Enlil, who sits comfortably on the holy dais, the lofty engur, to Nunamnir, whose lordship and princeship are most perfect. The [[Annanuki]] enter before him and obey his instructions faithfully.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

The hymn develops by relating Enlil founding and creating the origin of the city of Nippur and his organization of the earth.&lt;ref name="Kramer1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian mythology: a study of spiritual and literary achievement in the third millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga6jAe9hSaAC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1972|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1047-7|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] where the city exists before creation, here Enlil is shown to be responsible for its planning and construction, suggesting he surveyed and drew the plans before its creation:

{{cquote|When you mapped out the holy settlement on the earth, You built the city Nippur by yourself, Enlil. The Kiur, your pure place. In the Duranki, in the middle of the four quarters of the earth, you founded it. Its soil is the life of the land ([[Sumer]])&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"/&gt;}}

The hymn moves on from the physical construction of the city and gives a description and veneration of its [[ethics]] and moral code:

{{cquote|The powerful lord, who is exceedingly great in heaven and earth, who knows judgement, who is wise. He of great wisdom takes his seat in the [[Duranki]]. In princeship he makes the [[Kiur]], the great place, come forth radiantly. In Nippur, the 'bond' of heaven and earth, he establishes his place of residence. The City - its panorama is a terrifying radiance. To him who speaks mightily it does not grant life. It permits no inimical word to be spoken in judgement, no improper speech, hostile words, hostility, and unseemingliness, no evil, oppression, looking askance, acting without regard, slandering, arrogance, the breaking of promises. These abominations the city does not permit. The evil and wicked man do not escape its hand. The city, which is bestowed with steadfastness. For which righteousness and justice have been made a lasting possession.&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"/&gt;}}

The last sentence has been compared by R. P. Gordon to the description of [[Jerusalem]] in the [[Book of Isaiah]] ({{Bibleverse||Isaiah|1:21|HE}}), "the city of justice, righteousness dwelled in her" and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] ({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|31:23|HE}}), "O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness."&lt;ref name="Gordon1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. P. Gordon|title="The place is too small for us": the Israelite prophets in recent scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf3ZeuTyXiUC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1995|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-000-2|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth continues with the city's inhabitants building a temple dedicated to Enlil, referred to as the [[Ekur]]. The priestly positions and responsibilities of the Ekur are listed along with an appeal for Enlil's blessings on the city, where he is regarded as the source of all prosperity:

{{cquote|Without the Great Mountain, Enlil, no city would be built, no settlement would be founded; no cow-pen would be built, no sheepfold would be established; no king would be elevated, no lord would be given birth; no high priest or priestess would perform [[extispicy]]; soldiers would have no generals or captains; no carp-filled waters would ... the rivers at their peak; the carp would not ... come straight up from the sea, they would not dart about. The sea would not produce all its heavy treasure, no freshwater fish would lay eggs in the reedbeds, no bird of the sky would build nests in the spacious land; in the sky the thick clouds would not open their mouths; on the fields, dappled grain would not fill the arable lands, vegetation would not grow lushly on the plain; in the gardens, the spreading forests of the mountain would not yield fruits. Without the Great Mountain, Enlil, Nintud would not kill, she would not strike dead; no cow would drop its calf in the cattle-pen, no ewe would bring forth ... lamb in its sheepfold; the living creatures which multiply by themselves would not lie down in their ... ; the four-legged animals would not propagate, they would not mate.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

A similar passage to the last lines above has been noted in the Biblical Psalms ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|29:9|HE}}) "The voice of the Lord makes hinds to calve and makes goats to give birth (too) quickly".&lt;ref name="StolWiggermann2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marten Stol|author2=F. A. M. Wiggermann|title=Birth in Babylonia and the Bible: its Mediterranean setting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-n4LQNeU1ckC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-72371-89-8|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn concludes with further reference to Enlil as a farmer and praise for his wife, [[Ninlil]]:

{{cquote|When it relates to the earth, it brings prosperity: the earth will produce prosperity. Your word means flax, your word means grain. Your word means the early flooding, the life of the lands. It makes the living creatures, the animals (?) which copulate and breathe joyfully in the greenery. You, Enlil, the good shepherd, know their ways ... the sparkling stars. You married Ninlil, the holy consort, whose words are of the heart, her of noble countenance in a holy ma garment, her of beautiful shape and limbs, the trustworthy lady of your choice. Covered with allure, the lady who knows what is fitting for the E-kur, whose words of advice are perfect, whose words bring comfort like fine oil for the heart, who shares the holy throne, the pure throne with you, she takes counsel and discusses matters with you. You decide the fates together at the place facing the sunrise. Ninlil, the lady of heaven and earth, the lady of all the lands, is honoured in the praise of the Great Mountain.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

[[Andrew R. George]] suggested that the hymn to Enlil "can be incorporated into longer compositions" as with the [[Kesh temple hymn]] and "the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a [[Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)|Shulgi hymn]]."&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. R. George|title=Babylonian topographical texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zw0TQ1MrhOkC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1992|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-410-6|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

The poetic form and laudatory content of the hymn have shown similarities to the [[Book of Psalms]] in the [[Bible]], particularly Psalm 23 ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|23:1-2|HE}}) "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures."&lt;ref name="Bullock2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Hassell Bullock|title=An Introduction to the Old Testament Poetic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSGZbt7isfQC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Moody Publishers|isbn=978-0-8024-4157-7|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Line eighty four mentions:

{{cquote|Enlil, if you look upon the shepherd favourably, if you elevate the one truly called in the Land, then the foreign countries are in his hands, the foreign countries are at his feet! Even the most distant foreign countries submit to him.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

and in line ninety one, Enlil is referred to as a shepherd:

{{cquote|Enlil, faithful shepherd of the teeming multitudes, herdsman, leader of all living creatures.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

The shepherd motif originating in this myth is also found describing [[Jesus]] in the [[Book of John]] ({{Bibleverse||John|10:11-13|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="BeutlerFortna2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Johannes Beutler|author2=Robert T. Fortna|title=The Shepherd Discourse of John 10 and Its Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PzorWos1wC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=15 December 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02060-2|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Goodnick Westenholz|Joan Westenholz]] noted that "The farmer image was even more popular than the shepherd in the earliest personal names, as might be expected in an agrarian society." She notes that both Falkenstein and Thorkild Jacobsen consider the farmer refers to the king of Nippur; Reisman has suggested that the farmer or 'engar' of the Ekur was likely to be [[Ninurta]].&lt;ref name="PanainoPiras2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio Panaino|author2=Andrea Piras|title=Schools of oriental studies and the development of modern historiography: proceedings of the Fourth annual symposium of the Assyrian and Babylonian intellectual heritage project held in Ravenna, Italy, October 13-17, 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kR_vjs-1AQEC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2004|publisher=Mimesis Edizioni|isbn=978-88-8483-206-1|pages=285–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in line sixty

{{cquote|Its great farmer is the good shepherd of the Land, who was born vigorous on a propitious day. The farmer, suited for the broad fields, comes with rich offerings; he does not ...... into the shining E-kur.&lt;ref name="etcsl"/&gt;}}

Wayne Horowitz discusses the use of the word [[abzu]], normally used as a name for an abzu temple, god, cosmic place or cultic water basin. In the hymn to Enlil, its interior is described as a 'distant sea':

{{cquote|Its (Ekur's) [[me (mythology)|me]]'s (ordinances) are ''me''s of the [[Abzu]] which no-one can understand. Its interior is a distant sea which 'Heaven's Edge' cannot comprehend.&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian cosmic geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-99-7|pages=308–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The foundations of Enlil's temple are made of [[lapis lazuli]], which has been linked to the ''"soham"'' stone used in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|28:13|HE}}) describing the materials used in the building of ''"[[Garden of Eden|Eden]], the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|Garden of god]]"'' perched on ''"the mountain of the lord"'', [[Zion]], and in the [[Book of Job]] ({{Bibleverse||Job|28:6-16|HE}}) ''"The stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold"''.&lt;ref name="Hess1999"/&gt; [[Moses]] also saw God's feet standing on a ''"paved work of a sapphire stone"'' in ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|HE}}).

Along with the [[Kesh Temple Hymn]], Steve Tinney has identified the Hymn to Enlil as part of a standard sequence of [[scribe|scribal]] training scripts he refers to as the [[Decad (Sumerian texts)|Decad]]. He suggested that "the Decad constituted a required program of literary learning, used almost without exception throughout Babylonia. The Decad thus included almost all literary types available in Sumerian."&lt;ref name="Veldhuis2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niek Veldhuis|title=Religion, literature, and scholarship: the Sumerian composition Nanše and the birds, with a catalogue of Sumerian bird names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kPs3vicwI4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13950-3|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinney, Steve., On the Curricular Setting of Sumerian Literature, Iraq 61: 159-172.

{{History of Tunisia}}
'''Ifriqiya''' or '''Ifriqiyah''' ({{Lang-ar|إفريقية}} ''{{transl|aeb|Ifrīqya}}'') or '''el-Maghrib el-Adna''' (Lower West) was the area during [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] that comprises what is today [[Tunisia]], [[Tripolitania]] (western [[Libya]]) and the [[Constantinois]] (eastern [[Algeria]]); all part of what was previously included in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Province]] of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Ifriqiya/124749 Article « Ifriqiya » (Larousse.fr)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern boundary of Ifriqiya was far more unchallenged as bounded by the semi-arid areas and the salt marshes called el-[[Djerid]]. The northern and western boundaries fluctuated; at times as far north as [[Sicily]] otherwise just along the coastline, and the western boundary usually went as far as [[Béjaïa]]. The capital was briefly [[Carthage]], then [[Kairouan|Qayrawan]] (Kairouan), then [[Mahdia]], then [[Tunis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Arabic_Thought_and_Its_Place_in_History : DE LACY O’LEARY, D.D. "ARABIC THOUGHT AND ITS PLACE IN HISTORY" London: KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH, TRUBNER &amp; CO., LTD. / NEW YORK: E. P. DUTTON &amp; CO. (1922), pp. 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs generally settled on the lower ground while the native population settled in the mountains.{{citation needed|reason=Roman ruins after the conquest do not seem to go with this hypothesis and the native urban population outnumbered by many times the immigrants (arabs-egyptians-levantine-persians)|date=November 2015}}

The [[Aghlabids]], from their base in [[Kairouan]], initiated the invasion of [[Sicily]] beginning in 827 and establishing the [[Emirate of Sicily]], which lasted until it was conquered by the Normans.

{{Main|Muslim conquest of the Maghreb}}

* (''[[Cyrenaica]] and [[Tripolitana]] conquered in 643 by [[Amr ibn al-As]], organized as new province with regional capital at [[Barca (ancient city)|Barqa]]; first governors uncertain.'')&lt;ref&gt;See chronicles of [[Ibn Abd al-Hakam]] and [[al-Nuwayri]] for accounts of the conquest.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mu'awiya ibn Hudaij|Mu'awiya ibn Hudaij al-Kindi]], c.665–666  — ruled from [[Barca (ancient city)|Barqa]]&lt;ref&gt;This follows the tradition of al-Nuwayri, who says Mu'waiya ibn Hudaij was the first emir of Ifriqiya (ruling from Baqra) in 665.

'''John Patrick '''"'''Jack'''"''' Ryan Sr.''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCVOh}} is a fictional character created by author [[Tom Clancy]] and featured in his [[Ryanverse]] novels, which have consistently topped [[the New York Times Best Seller list]] over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bosman |first1=Julie |title=Tom Clancy, Best-Selling Master of Military Thrillers, Dies at 66 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/books/tom-clancy-best-selling-novelist-of-military-thrillers-dies-at-66.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Clancy’s death in 2013, four other authors have continued the Ryan franchise and its other connecting series with the approval of the Clancy family estate: [[Mark Greaney (novelist)|Mark Greaney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burch |first1=Peggy |title=Memphis-based writer Mark Greaney keeps thrills alive in Tom Clancy universe |url=http://archive.commercialappeal.com/entertainment/books/memphis-based-writer-mark-greaney-keeps-thrills-alive-in-tom-clancy-universe-ep-799939070-324085591.html |website=Memphis Commercial Appeal |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grant Blackwood]], [[Mike Maden]], and [[Marc Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steck |first1=Ryan |title=Exclusive: Big Changes Coming To The Tom Clancy Universe In 2017 |url=https://therealbookspy.com/2017/02/20/exclusive-big-changes-coming-to-the-tom-clancy-universe-in-2017/ |website=The Real Book Spy |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of a [[Baltimore]] police detective and a nurse, Jack Ryan is a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and stockbroker who became a history teacher at [[Boston College]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. Ryan later joins the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], as analyst and occasional field officer, eventually leaving it as [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]]. He later served as [[National security advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] before suddenly becoming [[President of the United States]] following a terrorist attack on the [[United States Capitol]]. Ryan went on to serve two non-consecutive terms and mostly dealt with international crises in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]].

Jack Ryan has been portrayed in Clancy’s film adaptations of four of his novels by [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Ben Affleck]]. In 2014, a reboot of the film series, titled ''[[Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit]]'', starred [[Chris Pine]]. The [[Jack Ryan (film series)|Jack Ryan film series]] have an unadjusted worldwide gross revenue of $788.4 million to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Ryan Movies|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=jackryan.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the 57th [[List of highest-grossing film series|highest-grossing film series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Franchises|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchises/sort/World|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|publisher=Nash Information Services|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Krasinski]] is the latest actor to play Ryan, in the [[Jack Ryan (TV series)|Amazon Prime web television series of the same name]], which premiered on August 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agard|first1=Chancellor|title=Watch Amazon's explosive 'Jack Ryan' Super Bowl ad before it airs|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/30/amazons-tom-clancys-jack-ryan-super-bowl-ad/|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 13, 2018|language=en|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ryan was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in 1950, the son of Emmet William Ryan (1922–1974), a [[Baltimore Police Department]] homicide lieutenant and [[World War II]] veteran. The elder Ryan had served with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]] at the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in western Europe. His mother, Catherine Burke Ryan (1923–1974), was a nurse. ''[[Without Remorse]]'' mentioned that he had a sister, who lived in [[Seattle]]. After graduating from [[Loyola Blakefield|Loyola High School]] (now Loyola Blakefield), a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Jesuit]] prep school in [[Towson, Maryland]] in suburban [[Baltimore County]], Ryan attended [[Boston College]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]] (with a strong [[Academic minor|minor]] in [[history]]) and a commission as a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] (via [[Officer Candidate School]]). While waiting for the Corps to assign him, he passed the [[Certified Public Accountant]] exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clancyfaq.com/John%20Patrick%20Ryan%20and%20Family.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209115311/http://www.clancyfaq.com/John%20Patrick%20Ryan%20and%20Family.htm |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After officer training at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]],  he went on to serve briefly as a Marine infantry [[Platoon leader]]. However, his military career was cut short at the age of 23 when his platoon's helicopter, a [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]], crashed during a [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] &lt;!-- (NATO) --&gt; exercise over the Greek island of [[Crete]]. The crash badly injured Ryan's back. U.S. Navy surgeons, at the [[National Naval Medical Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], inadequately repaired his back. This led to a lengthy recovery process (during which he became addicted to pain medications) after which, complete with a permanent disability and wearing a back brace, he left the Marines. He passed his [[stockbroker]]'s exam and took a position with [[Wall Street]] investment firm [[Merrill Lynch]]'s [[Baltimore]] office.

His parents died in a plane crash at [[Chicago Midway International Airport]], 19 months after his crash in Crete. He developed a fear of flying that persisted for years.

The [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|film version of ''The Hunt for Red October'']] changed his education background to being a 1972 graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 20 miles south of Baltimore in the state capital. In the 2018 Amazon Prime series, Ryan's Ph.D. is in economics rather than history.

==Civilian career==
While managing clients' portfolios, Ryan began to invest his own money, banking on a tip he had received from an uncle about the workers' takeover of the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]], making about $6 million off his $100,000 initial investment. He did so well that one of Merrill Lynch's senior vice presidents, Joe Muller, came to Baltimore to have dinner with him, with the objective of inviting him to the firm's [[New York City]] headquarters near [[Wall Street]]. Also present is Muller's daughter Caroline, nicknamed Cathy, then a senior medical student at The [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]]. They immediately fall in love and get engaged. 

One night, while having dinner with his fiancée, Ryan throws out his back. Cathy takes him directly to Dr. Stanley Rabinowitz, professor of [[neurosurgery]] at famed [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore, to be evaluated. Rabinowitz later operates on Ryan's back and cures his chronic pain in relatively short order (in a later novel, the surgeon is credited as Sam Rosen, a doctor introduced in ''[[Without Remorse]]''). Ryan subsequently persuades the government to terminate his disability checks. Cathy later becomes an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] surgeon at the Wilmer Eye Institute of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a Professor of Surgery at Johns Hopkins.

After creating a net worth of $8 million, Ryan left the firm after four years and enrolled at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for six [[doctorate|doctoral]] courses in history. He does a brief stint at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], then accepts a position at the U.S. Naval Academy as a civilian professor of history. In addition, he has also written books on naval history: ''Options and Decisions'', ''Doomed Eagles'', and ''Fighting Sailor'', a biography of World War II Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.|William "Bull" Halsey]], in which he justifies Halsey's actions during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

==First CIA work and career==
Following a recommendation from Father Tim O'Riley, a [[Jesuit]] priest and professor at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to a Central Intelligence Agency contact, Ryan was asked to work as a consultant for the agency, although officially employed by the [[MITRE Corporation]]. He agreed and spent several months at agency headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]], where he wrote a paper entitled "Agents and Agencies", in which he maintained that [[state-sponsored terrorism]] is an [[Casus belli|act of war]]. He also invented the [[canary trap]], a method for exposing an information leak, which involves giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of a group of suspects and seeing which version is leaked. By ensuring that each copy of the document differs slightly in its wording, if any copy is leaked, then it is possible to determine the informant's identity.

These accomplishments come to the attention of [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] James Greer, the CIA's Deputy Director for Intelligence. The expertise of Ryan's report, plus the application, persuaded Greer to offer him a permanent job in the CIA, but Ryan declined.

===''Patriot Games'' (1987)===
While in [[London]] with his family, Ryan stumbles upon a kidnapping attempt on the [[Prince of Wales]] and his family, which is orchestrated by Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army. He foils the attack by killing one gunman while injuring another and gets wounded in the process. Ryan is later knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] as an honorary [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]]; in the books, some British characters call him "Sir John" even though honorary knights are not permitted to use the style of "Sir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Knighthoods.aspx |title=The Monarchy Today &gt; Queen and public &gt; Honours &gt; Knighthoods |publisher=The official website of the British Monarchy |date= |accessdate=2015-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231155538/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Knighthoods.aspx |archivedate=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sean Miller, the Irish gunman Ryan wounded, was sentenced to life imprisonment but is freed by his ULA compatriots. Embittered over the failure of the kidnapping attempt, he exacts revenge on Ryan by attacking his wife and daughter. After pleas by Greer, Ryan agrees to join the CIA in a permanent position as an analyst, originally to gather intelligence on the ULA. Later, Miller and his men stage another kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales, who are visiting the Ryan family in their [[Maryland]] home; however, they are overpowered by the combined efforts of Ryan, his friend Robert "Robby" Jackson, and the Prince as well as law enforcement and naval officers who are nearby. After the ordeal, Ryan's second child [[Jack Ryan Jr.]] was born.

===''Red Rabbit'' (2002)===
Ryan's first CIA assignment is to London as a member of a liaison group to the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]]. Initially called in to assess the Soviet government and economy, Ryan is later tasked to assist in the defection of a [[KGB]] communications officer who has discovered that his boss [[Yuri Andropov]] had ordered [[Pope John Paul II]]'s assassination. Although Ryan and a small team of British SIS agents helps the "Rabbit" and his family get to the West, they fail to prevent the attack on the Pope (which actually happened in real life in 1981). Nevertheless, the pope is only wounded and his would-be assassin captured, while the British execute his Bulgarian handler. "Rabbit's" defection proves to be a major coup for both the American and British intelligence agencies. Ryan soon afterward suggests a nonmilitary long-term strategy to help hasten the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the [[Cold War]].

===''The Hunt for Red October'' (1984)===
Captain First Rank Marko Ramius, the [[Soviet Navy]]'s top submarine commander, takes command of the ''Красный Октябрь'' (''Krasny Oktyabr'', or in English, ''Red October''), the newest [[Typhoon class submarine|Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine]], with which he plans to defect with his officers. Having briefly met Captain Ramius at an embassy function several years before, Ryan is asked by Admiral Greer to brief the President's National Security Adviser Jeffrey Pelt and his staff in his first trip to the [[White House]] on Ramius' background and the deadly new capabilities of ''Red October's' ''secret revolutionary silent jet propulsion drive system. Ryan recognizes that the renegade ethnic [[Lithuania]]n captain may want to change sides rather than attack the West and works to establish contact with him at sea while on board the tailing American submarine ''USS Dallas'' and work to get him and his sub secretly to the U.S., eventually succeeding.''

===''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (1988)===
Ryan is reassigned to the CIA headquarters at Langley and becomes Admiral Greer’s special assistant. He is sent to [[Moscow]] as part of the American nuclear weapons reduction ([[START I|START]]) team, and later engineers the extraction of CARDINAL, CIA’s highest agent-in-place, from the country. Along the way, he also forces KGB chairman Nikolay Gerasimov to defect due to his anti-American nature, which could jeopardize the arms reduction talks once he becomes [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]. His plan involves a disinformation campaign that shows himself under [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] investigation for insider trading, which provides an opening for Gerasimov to help Ryan defect to the Soviet Union and work for the KGB.

===''Clear and Present Danger'' (1989)===
Ryan is promoted to acting DDI when Greer is hospitalized with [[cancer]]. Despite this, he is not made aware of a highly covert and illegal CIA operation encouraged by the President  claiming domestic drug abuse was a "clear and present danger" to American security, and approved by corrupt [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Admiral Cutter. This operation targets [[Colombia]]n drug lords in [[South America]] using light infantry troops of Hispanic descent and occasional precision air strikes with sophisticated "smartbombs", in what is usually considered a law enforcement area. Ryan works with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to rescue a small group of American soldiers cut off in Colombia, forcing him to miss Greer's funeral. Also in this operation, he first met the U.S. government operative [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]], with whom he would become friends. Around this time, Ryan also runs afoul of Elizabeth Elliot, international affairs advisor to then-presidential candidate [[Governor of Ohio]] J. Robert Fowler, and one of Cathy Ryan's former professors.

===''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1990)===
Ryan reaches his highest post at the CIA, [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]]. His career is jeopardized when Fowler becomes [[President of the United States|President]] and Elizabeth Elliott, Fowler's lover/manipulator, becomes National Security Advisor. They not only deny Ryan any credit for an innovative [[Middle East]] peace plan (basically turning [[Jerusalem]] into a [[Vatican City|Vatican]]-like city co-ruled by three Christian, Jewish, and Arab/Muslim mayors), but also panic when Palestinian and former East German terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in [[Denver]] during the [[Super Bowl]] and nearly plunge the world into a Soviet-American [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Ryan defuses the nuclear crisis by commandeering the Washington-Moscow hot line and convincing the Soviet Premier (through his friend Golovko) that the crisis is a setup. He then refuses to confirm Fowler's order to launch a nuclear missile at [[Qom]] (thus preventing the attack), where the [[Iran]]ian [[ayatollah]] lives. The crisis and Elliot scandal drives Fowler to resign. On this note, Ryan retires from the CIA and flies to [[Riyadh]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] to witness the execution of the surviving terrorists, and is then honored by the U.S.'s Middle Eastern allies by being presented with the sword used to execute the Iranian terrorists. 

The film again departs from the novel, by presenting a younger, unmarried Ryan, an intelligent mistress-free Fowler, a Greer-like Cabot, and the nuclear bomb is detonated over the city [[Baltimore]] instead of Denver. It also changes the identity of the terrorists from Iranians to [[neo-Nazis]].

===''[[Debt of Honor]]'' (1994)===
After a brief stint as a stockbroker, Ryan returns to government service as the National Security Advisor, restoring honor to the job that Cutter and Elliot disgraced. It has been two and a half years since Fowler resigned and his vice president, Roger Durling, is now well into his own term. Jack and the administration must deal with a second war between the U.S. and [[Japan]], as well as an attack on America's economic infrastructure. After a clean sweep of Japan's forces in the South Pacific, Vice President [[Ed Kealty]] is forced to resign after a sex scandal and President Durling taps Ryan for the job. Ryan accepts the job on the condition that he will only serve until the end of Durling's term, and sees this as a way of ending his public life. Only minutes after [[United States Congress|Congress]] confirms Ryan, though, a Japanese airline pilot deliberately crashes a [[Boeing 747|747]] into the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol building]] during [[Joint session of the United States Congress|Congress' joint session]], killing most of the people inside, decapitating the U.S. government, and elevating Ryan to the Presidency.

===''[[Executive Orders]]'' (1996)===
The reluctant yet determined Ryan administration emerges as Ryan slowly rebuilds the government. He is faced with Kealty's political trickery, as the former Vice President disputes his legitimacy as the nation's chief executive by publicly stating that he never actually resigned, when in fact a member of his staff had secretly taken the resignation letter from the office of the now-dead [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and destroyed it. Initially the lone voice of opposition to Ryan's policies on live television, he later enlists disaffected CIA intelligence officials (affected by the [[reduction in force]] at the agency in favor of more field operatives) to procure classified information on Ryan from his time in the CIA. He then suborns [[NBC]] news anchor and fellow Ryan critic Tom Donner into ambushing him with questions about his CIA career in a televised interview. Donner later realizes his mistake and publicly apologizes to President Ryan, while Kealty's challenge eventually fails in court.

Along the way, Ryan also has to deal with the dictator of the new United Islamic Republic (a coalition of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]]), the [[Ayatollah]] Mahmoud Haji Daryaei. The ayatollah regards him as a weakling and seizes the opportunity to stage a multi-pronged attack on the country: a biological attack using a weaponized strain of the [[Ebola virus]], a kidnapping attempt on his youngest daughter Katie, and an assassination attempt on himself through an Iranian [[sleeper agent]] disguised as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] bodyguard; with the U.S. overwhelmed by a multitude of crises, he believes that he can invade [[Saudi Arabia]] with little military opposition from the U.S. While the attempt on Katie was swiftly averted by the FBI and the Secret Service, the Ebola epidemic causes Ryan to declare martial law and enforce a travel ban that becomes instrumental in killing the virus, since it cannot survive in the American environment due to its fragile nature. He later deploys what is left of the American military to assist Saudi and Kuwaiti forces in repelling the UIR military, which also becomes successful. The would-be assassin is later arrested on the spot by the FBI after attempting to kill President Ryan inside the [[Oval Office]].

====Ryan Doctrine====
At the end of ''Executive Orders'', Ryan, in the tradition of Presidents [[Monroe Doctrine|Monroe]], [[Truman Doctrine|Truman]], [[Carter Doctrine|Carter]] and [[Reagan Doctrine|Reagan]], issues a [[foreign policy doctrine]] which largely defines his administration's international perspective. The Ryan Doctrine states that the U.S. will no longer tolerate attacks on "our territory, our possessions, or our citizens," and will hold whoever orders such attacks accountable.

This statement comes soon after the Ebola attack on the U.S. ordered by Daryaei. Ryan announces the new doctrine on television, momentarily cutting away to show Daryaei and his UIR advisors being incinerated by laser-guided bombs launched from two [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]]s, on Ryan's orders. Therefore, the Ryan doctrine supersedes the [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] put in place by President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], which forbids the assassination of foreign heads of state. Ryan, however, believes it is a more ethical alternative than [[total war]], since it punishes the person responsible for the attack instead of the people he rules.

Within the books, the Ryan doctrine is not officially invoked after Daryaei's death (although Ryan threatens to use it on the Chinese leadership in ''The Bear and the Dragon'', should anything happen to American citizens living in China as a consequence of the Siberian War).

===''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'' (2000)===
Ryan has completed Durling's term as President and has campaigned for the next election, which he wins. He retains most of his emergency [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and has [[Robby Jackson]] as Vice President. He has to deal with the attempted assassination of Golovko, who is now head of [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service]] (formerly the KGB). This turns out to be an attempt to sow confusion in the Russian government because of China's designs to [[annexation|annex]] [[Eastern Siberia]], where [[geology|geologists]] had recently discovered a large amount of oil and gold. These events lead to the inclusion of Russia into NATO and the assistance of U.S. forces in the Sino-Russian conflict (although attacks on NATO members outside the Atlantic should not trigger Article V). 

When the Chinese begin losing the war, U.S. forces target their strategic assets. A U.S. submarine sinks a Chinese [[ballistic missile submarine]], causing the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Chinese Politburo]] to panic and increase the readiness of their 12 land-based [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]s. U.S. forces do not have the ability to destroy the silos, as they could only use deep-penetrating bombs, which had all been used to destroy Chinese bridges to disrupt the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s (PLA) logistical support. This causes the U.S. and Russia to send a joint [[Rainbow Six (novel)|RAINBOW]]-[[Spetsnaz]] team to destroy the silos. They destroy 11 of the 12 ICBMs, but one of them manages to launch and head towards [[Washington, DC]], and with Ryan taking a command initiative at an [[Aegis Combat System|Aegis]] missile cruiser, the ICBM is intercepted by [[Anti-ballistic missile|ABM]]s from the {{USS|Gettysburg|CG-64|6}}. 

With the PLA's looming defeat in Siberia, which they were about to learn about via live [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] broadcasts from the CIA through the Internet, student demonstrators in Beijing raid a Politburo meeting, causing reformist minister Fang Gan to take control and arrest the war's perpetrators, making peace negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, and beginning China's transition to democracy.

====The Campus====
Following this, Ryan apparently completes his term and refuses to run for a second elected term. Robby Jackson thus campaigns to become the first [[African American]] President, but he is assassinated by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] on a trip to the [[Southern United States|South]], enabling Kealty, his opponent, to become the next President by default. Before Ryan leaves office, he creates The Campus, a covert [[counter-terrorism]] organization that [[Front company|fronts]] as Hendley Associates, a [[Trader (finance)|financial trading]] firm. He also writes 100 [[presidential pardon]]s for its members, with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Pat Martin's assistance.

==Second Ryan administration==
===''[[Dead or Alive (novel)|Dead or Alive]]'' (2010)===
In his retirement, Ryan is living easy with a net worth over $80 million. He is working on two versions of his [[memoir]]s, one for immediate release, and another detailing his CIA career to be published posthumously. However, he becomes increasingly frustrated with the direction in which President Kealty is taking the country, although he is initially publicly silent. Ultimately, he announces that he will come out of retirement to run for a second full term as President as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate. Despite having originally not being involved in the Campus's activities due to his high-profile status, he gradually becomes more directly linked to the Campus's operations, aiding them from behind the scenes on occasion. Here, Ryan learns his elder son, Jack Jr., is a field operative of the Campus, which he reluctantly accepts.

===''[[Locked On (novel)|Locked On]]'' (2011)===
Ryan then campaigns against Kealty, facing off against him in various televised debates. It quickly becomes apparent that Ryan will win the election, as the majority of Americans had never entirely accepted Kealty. Despite the efforts of Paul Laska, a high-profile Czech-American billionaire and a devout enemy of Ryan, and key members of the Kealty administration who labelled Ryan's longtime friend John Clark a fugitive in an effort to expose the Campus (as well as tying Ryan to it by association), Ryan narrowly wins the election, overcoming all of Kealty's efforts to harm him. The President-elect now prepares to undo the damage the Kealty administration has done.

===''[[Threat Vector]]'' (2012)===
Ryan initially finds his return to the presidency easy and without struggle following his re-election, but things quickly start to take a turn for the worse. Angered by a contraction in economic growth, the majority of the People's Republic of China Politburo Standing Committee members turn against their procapitalist President Wei Zhen Lin. Wei attempts to commit suicide when a coup is undertaken by other committee members. Only when Chairman Su Ke Qiang orders PLA tanks to defend Wei did he agree to promote and support Su's expansionist policies, in exchange for Su's ongoing protection. The expansionist policies - which include the annexation of Taiwan and the expansion of China's territory into the [[South China Sea]] - are finally revealed to the world after several months. The Ryan administration is vehemently against the new policies, and President Ryan himself decides to take action by supporting Taiwan, along with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which would also be affected by an expansion of China's territory.

A devastating series of [[cyber attack]]s on American infrastructure occurs, enacted by the "Ghost Ship" - a Chinese state-sponsored version of the Campus, using assets of the Chinese [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]] and [[Divine Sword]] Special Forces. The attacks serve to compromise the nation's national security apparatus and weaken the United States' resolve. The Campus helps track the attacks to China, and local investigation pinpoints the exact building where the Ghost Ship is currently quartered. President Ryan orders the destruction of the building, decapitating China's cyberwarfare abilities.

Ryan makes contact with Wei and warns him that the cyber attacks are considered an act of war on China's part. Wei repeatedly denies the claim, and reiterates he is supporting Su, though Ryan guesses correctly Su is controlling Wei since saving him from the attempted coup. Ryan appeals to Wei as a businessman to understand what he is doing will destroy China. After a lengthy, unusual pause, Wei responds that he must discuss Ryan's claims with Su, providing exact details of when and where Su will be travelling to address the politburo in regards to the war effort. Ryan takes the information as a request from Wei to have the United States assassinate Su. A team from the Campus, with support from the Russian FSB, and working with a local rebel force in China, stages an attack on Su while he is traveling in a motorcade. Su is assassinated by a U.S. sniper, but the event is made to look like Su's own men turned on him. Ryan announces a blockade of China's oil supplies until the war effort is abandoned, calling upon Wei and the politburo to accept defeat.

President Wei accepts that the expansionist movement has failed and the United States has won its second war with China, and decides to take his own life after realizing the politburo will move against him without Su's protection. Wei botches the suicide by accidentally shooting himself in the cheek, but ends up choking to death on his own blood. Wei and Su's deaths mark the end of the war in the South China Sea, and Ryan emerges the clear victor in the conflict.

===''[[Command Authority (novel)|Command Authority]]'' (2013)===
Ryan and his administration contend with the Russian Federation, currently led by their new President, Valeri Volodin. Volodin is established as a dedicated communist opposed to the West, seeking to restore Russia as a strengthened Soviet Union. Volodin moves to establish ties with Iran and China, reunify the nation's state security services under the FSB, and most notably annex Ukraine. Those opposed to his actions are replaced or assassinated by Russian government forces or elements of the "Seven Strong Men", a Mafia group that is now easily the most powerful and dangerous criminal underworld faction in Russia. When the FSB and SVR are officially merged following their director's assassination, Volodin makes the announcement that FSB director Roman Romanovich Talanov, Volodin's enigmatic enforcer, is the nation's new intelligence chief.

Sergey Golovko, having retired from the SVR and effectively exiled from Russia for acting as a high-profile Kremlin dissident against Volodin and his policies, succumbs to poisoning from a radioactive agent while at a private lunch at the White House. Ryan's old friend dies the next day, but on his deathbed, Golovko relays his concerns of Talanov's unknown background and mysterious connection to Volodin to Ryan. Ryan resolves to decipher Talanov's history and work out his links to Volodin, hopeful the answers behind his swift rise to power can be used as leverage against Volodin. As armed conflict becomes increasingly likely, Ryan focuses on the growing armed standoff in Ukraine and absorption of Crimea, with the rest of Ukraine facing imminent Russian invasion. An investigation following Golovko's death implicates the SSM working with the FSB. It also possibly identifies Talanov as a mysterious ex-GRU assassin who operated for the KGB during the Cold War, code-named "Zenith". Ryan is personally alarmed by these discoveries - he became involved in the Zenith affair in his time with the CIA as a MI6 liaison officer, during an investigation into a string of deaths in Berlin. Ryan ultimately sensed an unknown Russian operator was at work behind the events in Berlin, but he was encouraged by MI6 Director General Sir Basil Charleston to let it go. The mystery of Zenith was left unsolved for 30 years, and remained the sole remaining mystery of Ryan's intelligence career.

Operational assets of the Campus, with Jack Ryan Jr. leading the effort (much to his father's displeasure and trepidation for his safety), ultimately confirm Talanov was Zenith, and Volodin, a senior KGB officer at the time, still acts as his control officer. As young men, they were employed by members of the KGB and GRU leadership who knew the Soviet Union would eventually fall, but made a plan to survive and prosper in the chaotic aftermath, so they could seize control of the nation and turn it back to communism stronger than ever. After siphoning billions from Soviet programs to achieve it, Volodin double-crossed his co-conspirators and had Talanov kill them all so it would be theirs alone. Others were killed to maintain the safety of their black funds, including the bankers killed by Talanov during the Zenith affair so as to prevent exposure to the rest of the KGB. Talanov is also the secret leader of the Seven Strong Men, having been sent undercover with the SSM - placed in a gulag, Talanov worked his way up to become a charter member and leader of the Seven Strong Men, and through them become FSB director for the SSM's benefit and control of the government, when in actuality the SSM was a tool for Volodin's policies.

These discoveries are made with the help of former MI5 officer Victor Oxley, "Bedrock" - an off-book MI5 asset who operated as an assassin during the Cold War in similar fashion to Talanov, aka Zenith. Oxley's final mission before his disappearance was to hunt down and kill Zenith, but instead found Ryan Sr. about to be killed by a German Stasi team working with Zenith. Oxley interfered and saved Ryan's life, but was captured, driven away to Russia, brutally tortured by the KGB, and then imprisoned in the same gulag where Talanov ultimately was placed, accidentally hearing of Talanov being Zenith from other inmates. Oxley and the Campus team confront his traitorous control officer Hugh Castor, who confirms the entire story and protected Volodin and Talanov's secret in exchange for a cut of their black funds, but Castor gives up what he knows for protection by the American government, knowing Talanov will have realized Castor deceived him over the leverage he had. However, Talanov realizes this faster than Castor anticipated - a Spetsnaz team attacks Castor's property, and kill Castor and Oxley, the latter sacrificing himself for Jack Jr.

As the Russian invasion force pushes into Ukraine, the Campus team and Delta Force operators arrest Dmitri Nesterov, aka "Gleb the Scar", an SSM capo who is Talanov's second-in-command and who was behind Golovko's poisoning. With Nesterov and the Campus's acquired information in hand, Ryan makes contact with Volodin and confronts him with implications he could be politically destroyed by what he has learned about Zenith and Talanov's ties to the SSM: claiming (falsely) to have suitable evidence gathered that will ruin his government and the invasion, and he must distance himself from Talanov as the Campus has exposed him as a government spy who has been using them all along. Volodin pulls back his troops; in exchange, the United States keeps what evidence it has secret. Volodin also forces Talanov to resign from the FSB after his criminal dealings are made public and the SSM turns on him. Despite the promise of protection, Volodin arranged for Talanov to be killed - he is fatally stabbed by a civilian member of his guard force to earn the Seven Strong Men's favor. The stalemate of Russia and the United States is left ongoing.

Ryan, at this time, is in his mid-sixties and world-famous; and is looking forward to retirement back to the shores of Chesapeake Bay once and for all.

===''Support and Defend'' (2014)===
Dominic Caruso, a Campus operator and FBI agent and one of Ryan's nephews, targets the source of a classified intelligence leak that led to the deaths of retired Israeli commando and his family who he had befriended while on leave from the organisation for training. Ryan orders an FBI counterintelligence investigation and identifies Ethan Ross, a bitter narcissist and mid-level staffer for the National Security Council, as the source. Ross goes on the run with a microdrive containing enough information to dismantle America's worldwide intelligence efforts. Caruso pursues Ross across the world, with Ryan mentioned as having made Ross America's #1 fugitive. Despite interference from the Russian FSB and Iranian [[Quds Force]], Caruso kills Ross, recovers the drive and has the Revolutionary Guards officer who masterminded the leak arrested by the U.S. military.

===''[[Full Force and Effect]]'' (2014)===
Ryan and his administration contend against North Korea, now led by the insanely paranoid and incompetent Choi Ji-hoon, who attempts to start production at a rare earth mineral deposit found in their territory, and use the resulting trillions in wealth to purchase nuclear weapons technology. Despite public indifference, political backlash and the sabotage of a key United Nations vote (by a corrupt defense contractor hired by the North Korean [[Reconnaissance General Bureau]]) to strengthen sanctions against the Hermit Kingdom, Ryan perseveres on the grounds North Korea's success would endanger global security. After successfully stalling the mine from beginning production by ordering the technology shipment seized by the U.S. Navy, Choi makes the decision to order his RGB director to assassinate Ryan to eliminate his interference. During a visit to Mexico City, Ryan suffers an assassination attempt on his motorcade, which barely fails, and he escapes with minor injury. North Korea's involvement is exposed due to the Campus team investigating (but one operator is killed in the process). Further, the DRPK's mining director defects to the United States, and Ryan uses his knowledge of Choi's actions to arrange a deal with Chinese President Ling to publicly expose Choi's inept leadership - Choi is deposed and secretly executed.

===''Under Fire'' (2015)===
Ryan sanctions an operation in Dagestan between the CIA, masterminded by Jack Jr.'s childhood friend Seth Gregory, and the SIS, coordinated by legendary operative Raymond Wellesley. The operation is to push Dagestan to full independence and sovereignty from Russia by forcing out their corrupt President Nabiyev, and promoting the instalment of his Interior Minister, Rebaz Medzhid, in his place. The operation goes off-the-rails when Wellesley attempts to dismantle the operation with the SVR's assistance. Jack Jr., who is in the country and becomes wrapped up in the events, works with Seth (who is killed by one of Medzhid's traitorous bodyguards) and the CIA to successfully launch the revolution and gathers the evidence necessary to have Wellesley arrested by SIS for his treasonous actions. President Ryan and his international counterparts force President Volodin to back down rather than put down the Dagestani rebels with military force.

===Films===
{{Main|Jack Ryan (film series)}}
[[File:Harrison Ford by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Actor Harrison Ford, who portrays Jack Ryan in two films in the series]]
Five films based on Clancy novels featuring Jack Ryan have been produced.  The movie portraying the earliest incarnation of Ryan (fifth film chronologically) is titled ''[[Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit]]'' and stars [[Chris Pine]]. Released on January 17, 2014, it follows Ryan's move from his accident in the Marines into his CIA career.  Jack Ryan is also portrayed by [[Alec Baldwin]] in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[Harrison Ford]] in ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992), and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994), and [[Ben Affleck]] in the 2002 film ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]''.

In the novels, ''Patriot Games'' occurs before ''The Hunt for Red October'', though the order was reversed in the film versions. Additionally, ''The Sum of All Fears'' is not part of Baldwin/Ford series, but rather an intended [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise which departs significantly from the chronology of the novels. It takes place in 2002, whereas the novel takes place in 1991/1992. ''Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit'' is a second reboot of the franchise and departs from all previous films.

'''''John Bull''''' is a British-built [[Rail transport|railroad]] [[steam locomotive]] that operated in the [[United States]]. It was operated for the first time on September 15, 1831, and it became the oldest operable steam locomotive in the world when the [[Smithsonian Institution]] operated it in 1981.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired&gt;{{cite web| url=http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=225| title=John Bull Locomotive| work=History Wired| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klein280&gt;Klein and Bell, pp 280–1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Built by [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], the ''John Bull'' was initially purchased by and operated for the [[United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company|Camden and Amboy Railroad]], the first railroad in [[New Jersey]], which gave ''John Bull'' the number 1 and its first name, "''Stevens''". ([[Robert L. Stevens]] was president of the Camden and Amboy Railroad at the time.). The C&amp;A used the locomotive heavily from 1833 until 1866, when it was removed from active service and placed in storage.

After the C&amp;A's assets were acquired by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) in 1871, the PRR refurbished and operated the locomotive a few times for public displays: it was fired up for the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883. In 1884 the locomotive was purchased by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the museum's first major industrial exhibit.

In 1939 the employees at the PRR's [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], [[Pennsylvania]], workshops built an operable replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties, as the Smithsonian desired to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment. After being on static display for the next 42 years, the Smithsonian commemorated the locomotive's 150th birthday in 1981 by firing it up, making it the world's oldest surviving operable steam locomotive. Today, the original ''John Bull'' is on static display once more in the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The replica ''John Bull'' is preserved at the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]].

==Construction and initial use==

The  ''John Bull'' was built in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], England, by [[Robert Stephenson and Company]] for the [[United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company|Camden and Amboy Railroad]] (C&amp;A), the first railroad built in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ThOh8bBIN9QC&amp;dq=John+Bull+locomotive| title=American Railway Transportation| author=Johnson, Emory Richard| authorlink=Emory Richard Johnson| year=1908| pages=41–42| publisher=D.

The prince's wife, [[Catherine Willis Gray]], made a point of hurrying onto the train so she could be declared the first woman to ride a steam-powered train in America, though unknown to her, men and women had already ridden behind the steam powered maiden runs on the [[Baltimore and Ohio]], [[South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company|South Carolina Railroad]], and the [[Albany and Schenectady Railroad|Mohawk and Hudson]] by this point in 1831.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PRRchron1831&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1831%20June%2004.wd.pdf| title=PRR Chronology: 1831| publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society|date=June 2004| accessdate=August 4, 2008| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson225&gt;Wilson, p 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the railroad was completed, the locomotive was placed in storage; horse-drawn cars served the construction efforts until 1833.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;  The C&amp;A applied both numbers and names to their first locomotives, giving this engine the number 1 and officially naming it ''Stevens'' (after the C&amp;A's first president, [[Robert L. Stevens]]).&lt;ref name=Whittemore30&gt;Whittemore, p 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through regular use of the engine, crews began calling it ''the old John Bull'',&lt;ref name=PAmuseumreplica /&gt; a reference to the cartoon personification of England, [[John Bull]]. Eventually the informal name was shortened to ''John Bull'' and this name was so much more widely used that ''Stevens'' fell out of use.&lt;ref name=PAmuseumreplica /&gt;

In September 1836 the ''John Bull''  and two [[coach (rail)|coach]]es were shipped by canal to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], and became the first locomotive to operate there.&lt;ref name=Wilson54&gt;Wilson, p 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical modifications and early exhibitions==
[[File:John Bull as it appeared in 1877.jpg|thumb|left|The ''John Bull'' as it appeared in 1877. Note the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] and wider exhaust stack.&lt;br /&gt;''(Image from the collection of the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution, [http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/ America On The Move] exhibit, used with permission)''.]]

Stephenson built the locomotive originally as an [[0-4-0]]. The locomotive's power was transmitted to the driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels and in front of the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a [[connecting rod]] between the two axles to power the front axle.

Due to poorer quality track than was the norm in its native England, the locomotive had much trouble with derailment; the C&amp;A's engineers added a [[leading truck]] to help guide the engine into curves.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;  The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the ''John Bull'' became a [[4-2-0]]. Later, the C&amp;A also added a [[pilot (locomotive)|pilot]] ("cowcatcher") to the lead truck.&lt;ref name=Klein283&gt;Klein and Bell, pp 283–287.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C&amp;A also added a [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] to the locomotive. C&amp;A workshop crews also added safety features such as a [[Locomotive bell|bell]] and [[Locomotive headlamp|headlight]].

After several years serving as a [[switcher|switching engine]] and stationary [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]],&lt;ref name=PRRchron1866&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1866%20June%2004.wd.pdf| title=PRR Chronology: 1866| publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society|date=June 2004| format=PDF| accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''John Bull'' was retired in 1866 and stored in [[Bordentown, New Jersey]]. Toward the end of its life in revenue service, the locomotive worked as a [[pump]] engine and as the power for a sawmill.&lt;ref name=White32-4&gt;White, pp 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The C&amp;A was soon absorbed into the [[United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company]] (1869) which itself was merged into the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rnetzlof.pennsyrr.com/corphist/urrnj.html| title=Corporate Genealogy: United New Jersey Railroad| author=Netzlof, Robert T.| date=February 7, 2001| accessdate=August 4, 2008| archive-url=https://archive.is/20081202122901/http://rnetzlof.pennsyrr.com/corphist/URRNJ.html| archive-date=December 2, 2008| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PRR saw the potential publicity to be gained by exhibiting such an old engine, showing it at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]];&lt;ref name=Forney177&gt;{{cite magazine| title=American Locomotives and Cars| author=Forney, M. N.| page=177| volume=IV|magazine=Scribner's Magazine| issue=2|date=August 1888| authorlink=Matthias N. Forney}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRR workshop staff then "back-dated" the engine (by replacing some original parts with parts that "looked" old or by removing them entirely). The [[Chimney|exhaust stack]] was replaced with a straight tube of metal and the cab walls and roof were removed. The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the ''National Railway Appliance Exhibition'' in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=White39 /&gt;  In 1885, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] accepted the donation of the ''John Bull'' from the PRR as the Institution's first large engineering artifact.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;

==Smithsonian Institution and locomotive restoration==
At the exhibition in 1883, the Pennsylvania Railroad ended up resolving two problems at once. In the Smithsonian Institution, the railroad was able to find a home for the historic locomotive, as well as a suitable new employer for a young civil engineer named [[J. Elfreth Watkins]]. Watkins had been involved in an accident on the railroad in [[New Jersey]] a few years before the exhibition.  He had lost a leg in the accident, so he was no longer suited to the physical demands of railroad work, although the railroad did employ him as a clerk for a while after his accident. The PRR employed his engineering experience as an expert curator for the Smithsonian's new Arts and Industries Building, which was opened in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Massa, William R., Jr.| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| year=2004| url=http://siarchives.si.edu/findingaids/FARU7268.htm| title=Finding Aids to Personal Papers and Special Collections in the Smithsonian Institution Archives: Record Unit 7268; J.

[[File:John Bull at the Columbian Exposition-2.jpg|thumb|''John Bull'' at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893]]
The locomotive remained on display in this location for nearly 80 years, but it was transported for display outside the museum on certain rare occasions. The most significant display in this time occurred in 1893 when the locomotive traveled to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893|author1=White, Trumbull |author2=Igleheart, William |author3=Palmer, Bertha Honoré | year=1893| publisher=P.W. Ziegler and Company| page=286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pennsylvania Railroad, like many other railroads of the time, put on grand displays of their progress; the PRR arranged for the locomotive and a couple of coaches to be delivered to the railroad's [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], workshops where it would undergo a partial restoration to operating condition. The PRR was planning an event worthy of the locomotive's significance to American railroad history&amp;nbsp;— the railroad actually planned to operate the locomotive for the entire distance between New Jersey and Chicago.&lt;ref name=White39 /&gt;

The restoration was supervised by the PRR's chief mechanical officer, [[Theodore N. Ely]]. Ely was confident enough in its 50-mile (80.5&amp;nbsp;km) test run to [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]], [[New Jersey]] (which took two hours and fifteen minutes), that the [[Governor (United States)|governors]] of all the states that the locomotive was to pass through and the then [[President of the United States]], [[Grover Cleveland]], were invited to ride behind the engine on its first leg toward Chicago. The ''John Bull'' was to pull a few [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s in a train that would carry dignitaries and representatives of the press. The train traveled to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the charge of one locomotive crew. From Philadelphia, local engineers (train drivers) were employed to ride on the locomotive's footplate as [[maritime pilot|pilots]] to advise the operators for the trip over the local engineers' territories for the rest of the journey to Chicago. Traveling at {{convert|25|to|30|mph|km/h}}, the train departed from the Pennsylvania Railroad's Jersey City station at 10:16&amp;nbsp;a.m. on April 17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/04/18/106863433.pdf| format=PDF| work=New York Times| date=April 18, 1893| title=John Bull on the Way West| accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached Chicago on April 22.&lt;ref name=Carter140 /&gt;  The locomotive operated during the exhibition giving rides to the exhibition's attendees, and then the train left Chicago on December 6 for the return trip to Washington. The locomotive arrived back in Washington on December 13.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 the ''John Bull'' again traveled outside the museum. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] was celebrating its centenary that year in its [[Fair of the Iron Horse]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;  Since the locomotive's original [[tender (locomotive)|tender]] (fuel and water car) had deteriorated beyond repair and was dismantled in 1910, the PRR built a replica of the tender at its [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], [[Pennsylvania]], workshops.&lt;ref name=PAmuseumroster&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rrmuseumpa.org/about/roster/locomotiveroster.pdf| title=Motive Power Roster| publisher=Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania| format=PDF| date=August 2007| accessdate=August 4, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703151453/http://www.rrmuseumpa.org/about/roster/locomotiveroster.pdf| archivedate=July 3, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The locomotive was also refurbished in Altoona for operation during the fair.&lt;ref name=White45&gt;White, p 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fair was the last steam up for the locomotive until 1980.

==(Mostly) static display==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Bull at the Smithsonian, 1920.jpg|thumb|The ''John Bull'' on display in the East Hall, 1920]] --&gt;
After the locomotive returned to the Smithsonian, it remained on static display.  In 1930 the museum commissioned the [[Altoona Works]] to build a second replica of the locomotive's [[tender (railroad car)|tender]] for display with the locomotive in the museum. This time, however, the replica tender re-used some of the fittings that the museum had retained when the original tender was dismantled twenty years earlier.&lt;ref name=White45 /&gt;

The Smithsonian recognized the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have the funds to refurbish the locomotive for full operation again, it was decided to run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using [[Jack (device)|jacks]]) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the [[CBS|CBS radio network]] with [[Stanley Bell]] narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRR again borrowed the locomotive from 1933 to 1934 for the [[Century of Progress]] exhibition in Chicago. Unlike its earlier jaunt to Chicago, for this trip, the railroad hauled and displayed it as a static exhibit. While this exhibit was progressing, the Altoona Works were busy again building a replica; this time the replica was an operable copy of the locomotive. The replica was then operated in 1940 at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]], while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=White46&gt;White, p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original locomotive was displayed outside the museum one more time in 1939 at the New York World's Fair, but the museum's curators decided that the locomotive was becoming too fragile for repeated outside exhibits. It was then placed in somewhat permanent display back in the East Hall where it remained for the next 25 years.  In 1964 the locomotive was moved to its current home, the [[National Museum of American History]], then called the Museum of History and Technology.&lt;ref name=White46 /&gt;

[[File:John Bull operating in 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|The original locomotive under steam in 1981]]
The ''John Bull'' had remained on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance as one of the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.&lt;ref name=White46-48&gt;White, pp 46–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Many superficial inspections were performed on the locomotive in 1980 and it was found to be in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods for the first time since its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.&lt;ref name=White46-48 /&gt;

The running gear seemed to be in good order, but it was still unknown if the boiler could still handle the pressure of steam and a live fire again. The museum asked the [[Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company]] to inspect the locomotive's boiler for operation. The inspections were conducted after hours at the museum (from 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) over three days and included [[electromagnet]]ic, [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], and [[radiography|radiographic]] tests. The tests did reveal a few flaws, but it was projected that the engine could operate at a reduced boiler pressure of 50 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]] (340 [[kilopascal|kPa]] or 3.5 [[kilogram-force|kgf]]/cm²); as delivered to the Camden &amp; Amboy, the boiler was rated for {{convert|70|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} or 4.9 kgf/cm². The Smithsonian's staff, after a few further hydrostatic tests, were confident that the locomotive could again operate under its own power.&lt;ref name=White46-48 /&gt;  The items that needed repair were repaired, and on October 14, 1980, the locomotive was successfully field-tested on the Warrenton Branch Line in Fauquier County between Calverton and Casanova, Virginia. The site was selected, because at the time, only one freight train per week used the branch line. On September 15, 1981, the locomotive operated under steam on a few miles of branch line near the [[Potomac River]] within [[Washington, D.C.]]  With this exhibition, the locomotive became the oldest operable steam locomotive (and oldest self-propelled [[vehicle]]) in the world.&lt;ref name=HistoryWired /&gt;

The original ''John Bull'' is housed on static display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., while the replica of the ''John Bull'', built in 1939, is owned and preserved by the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]] is stored serviceable, having not been fired up in years.

'''Joyce Nicholson''' (née 'Thorpe) (1 June 1919 – 30 January 2011) was an Australian author, business woman and a significant contributor to an Australian political organisation, the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]].

The daughter of Publisher D.W. Thorpe, Nicholson was born in [[Melbourne]] and educated at [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] and the [[University of Melbourne]]. She was active in the women's movement as one of the founding members of the Woman's Electoral Lobby and Sisters Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/archives/sisters.html  |title=Sisters Publishing |accessdate=6 February 2011 |publisher=The University of Melbourne |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212142424/http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/archives/sisters.html |archivedate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was a significant influence in the Australian publishing industry for many years as managing director, and later sole owner, of D.W. Thorpe Pty Ltd (from 1968 to 1987 when the firm was sold). She authored over 25 books, many of them dealing with children and women. She married Harvey Nicholson and had four children: [[Peter Nicholson (cartoonist)|Peter]], Hilary, Wendy, and Michael.

Joyce sponsored a major collection of books by and about Australian women, the ''Joyce Thorpe Nicholson Collection'' at Melbourne University. It includes rare nineteenth century material, as well as scarce twentieth-century political [[ephemera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/special/collections/australiana/nicholson.html|title=Joyce Thorpe Nicholson Australian Women Collection |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Joyce Thorpe Nicholson Hall of Fame Award'' is sponsored by [http://www.thorpe.com.au/ Thorpe Bowker] and presented periodically to a designer whose body of work has made a significant

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Ka'b Ibn Mama al-Iyadi''' ({{lang-ar|كعب بن مامة الإيادي}}) was a pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arab]] figure proverbial for his munificence, and in particular for "giving water to a companion and himself dying of thirst as result".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowson|first=Everett K.|title=Religion and Politics in the Career of Badîʿ al-Zamân al-Hamadhânî |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1987|volume=107|issue=4|pages=653–673|jstor=603306|publisher=American Oriental Society|doi=10.2307/603306}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Abd Rabbih|Ibn `Abd Rabbih]], he was one of three people who reached the highest point of generosity in the pre-Islamic era, the other two were [[Hatim al-Tai]] and [[Harim ibn Sinan al-Murri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Abd Rabbih|Ibn `Abd Rabbih (Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad)]], Al-‘Iqd al-farīd&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaʻb died of [[dehydration]] in one of his travels when he favored his companion, al-Namari ({{lang-ar|النمَّري}}), over himself for the remaining water they had carried. His story with al-Namari displays a high degree of ''i'thar'' ([[altruism]]), a trait which the pre-Islamic Arabs regarded with great admiration.

== Story with al-Namari ==

While traveling in the scorching heat of the sun with a company that included a man from al-Namr ibn Qasit, the group ran short of water and decided to split all the water they had carried equally amongst them. Each time the man who served the water turned around the group and reached Kaʻb for his share, Kaʻb's companion, al-Namari, would look upon Kaʻb and stare at him with an appeal for the water, to which Kaʻb responded by telling the server: "Serve your brother al-Namari" ({{lang-ar|اسق أخاك النمري}}) which later became a classical Arabic proverb. This was done repeatedly until Kaʻb became completely exhausted and weak that the moment they found a well some time later, he wasn't able to move and eventually died of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Sayyid al-Baṭalyawsī (‘Abd Allah ibn Muḥammad), Ḥulal fī sharḥ abyāt al-jumal, p.104. الحلل في شرح أبيات الجُمَل,

[[File:Kafiristan.gif|thumb|right|250px|Map of Kafiristan prior to its conversion to Islam in 1890s]]

'''Kāfiristān''', or '''Kāfirstān''' ({{lang-prs|کافرستان}}), is a [[historical region]] that covered present-day [[Nuristan Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] and its surroundings. This historic region lies on, and mainly comprises, the basins of the rivers [[Alingar River|Alingar]], [[Pech river|Pech (Kamah)]], [[Landai Sin river|Landai Sin]] and [[Kunar River|Kunar]], and the intervening mountain ranges. It is bounded by the main range of the [[Hindu Kush]] on the north, [[Pakistan|Pakistan's]] [[Chitral District]] to the east, the [[Kunar Valley]] in the south and the [[Alishang River]] in the west. 

Kafiristan took its name because of the enduring pagan [[Nuristanis|Nuristani]] inhabitants of the region who once followed a form of [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hinduism]], mixed with locally-developed accretions, were non-[[Islam|Muslims]] and were thus known to the surrounding Muslim population as [[Kafir]], meaning "[[infidel]]".&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Nuristanis1.html|title=Richard Strand's Nuristân Site: Peoples and Languages of Nuristan|author=[[Richard Strand|Richard F. Strand]]|date=31 December 2005|work=nuristan.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely related to the [[Kalash people]], a fiercely independent people with a distinctive culture, language and religion.

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as "Peristan", a vast area containing host of "Kafir" cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period, but was forced to become Muslim by [[Abdul Rahman Khan]]. The region was earlier surrounded by Buddhist states that temporarily brought literacy and state rule to the mountains, the decline of Buddhism heavily isolated the region. It was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia
|title=Fence of Peristan - The Islamization of the "Kafirs" and Their Domestication|publisher=Società Italiana di Antropologia e Etnologia|author=Alberto M. Cacopardo|year=2016|pages=69, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Kafiristan'' or ''Kafirstan'' is normally taken to mean "land [''[[-stan]]''] of the [[kafir]]s" in [[Persian language]], where the name {{rtl-lang|fa|کافیر}} ''{{transl|fa|kafir}}'' is derived from the Arabic {{rtl-lang|ar|كافر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāfir}}'', literally meaning a person who refuses to accept a principle of any nature and figuratively as a person refusing to accept Islam as his faith and is commonly translated into English as an "[[infidel]]" or "unbeliever". However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name [[Kata people|Kati]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref name=Pellat&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume IV|editor1=C. E. Bosworth|editor1-link=C. E. Bosworth, |editor2=E. Van Donzel|editor3=Bernard Lewis|editor3-link=Bernard Lewis|editor4=Charles Pellat|editor4-link=Charles Pellat|page=409|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kafiristan was inhabited by people who followed a form of [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hinduism]] before their forcible conversion to [[Islam]] in 1895-1896.&lt;ref name="nuristan.info"/&gt;

The word "kafir" has also been suggested to be linked to ''Kapiś'' (= ''Kapish''), the ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of the region that included historic Kafiristan. According to the theory, the name may have then mutated at some point into the word ''Kapir,'' and once again into the word Kafir.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Dr Moti Chandra - India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Census of India, 1961, p 26, published by India Office of the Registrar General.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Kāṭhakasaṅkalanam: Saṃskr̥tagranthebhyaḥ saṅgr̥hītāni Kāṭhakabrāhmaṇa, Kāṭhakaśrautasūtra, 1981, p xii, Surya Kanta; cf: The Contemporary Review, Vol LXXII, July-Dec, 1897, p 869, A. Strahan (etc), London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Levi states that ''Chinese Kipin is a rendering of an Indian word Kapir'' (See quote in: Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 44, Moti Chandra - India; See also: Bhārata-kaumudī; Studies in Indology in Honour of Dr. Radha Kumud Mookerji, 1945, p 916, Radhakumud Mookerji - India).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 9th century AD, Kapiśi remained the second capital of the [[Kabul Shahi|Shahi dynasty]] of [[Kabul]]. Kapiśa was known for goats and their skin.&lt;ref&gt;Geography of the Mahabharata, 1986, p 183, B.

The people used woollen and fur clothes and gold,&lt;ref&gt;Corpus II. 1, xxiv; Cambridge History of India, Vol i\I, p 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient references like [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]] etc profusely attest that the [[Kambojas]] produced and made use of woollen, fur and skin clothes and shawls, all embroidered with gold. Ancient Kambojas were noted for their horses, gold, woollen blankets, furry clothing etc (Foundations of Indian Culture, 1990, p 20, Dr Govind Chandra Pande&amp;nbsp;– Spiritualism (Philosophy); Hindu World, Volume I, 1968, p 520, Benjamin Walker etc&lt;/ref&gt; silver and copper coins.

=== Medieval history ===

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as "Peristan", a vast area containing host of "Kafir" cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhist states and societies]] which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilious according to reports of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa-hsien]] and [[Sung Yun]]. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The [[Kalasha people]] of lower [[Chitral]] are the last surviving heirs of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia

=== Early modern and later history ===
The first European recorded as having visited Kafiristan was the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] [[Bento de Góis]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]. By his account, he visited a city named "Capherstam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=De Land-Reyse, door Benedictus Goes, van Lahor gedaan, door Tartaryen na China|url=http://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/15489?view=print|author=Pieter Vander Aa|publisher=Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1602, during the course of a journey from [[Lahore]] to [[China]].&lt;ref name="newby"&gt;{{cite book|title=A short walk in the Hindukush|first=Eric|last=Newby|chapter=A little bit of protocol|pages=74–93|isbn=978-0-330-46267-9|publisher=Picador India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American adventurer [[Colonel Alexander Gardner]] claimed to have visited Kafiristan twice, in 1826 and 1828.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt; On the first occasion, [[Dost Mohammad Khan|Dost Mohammad]], the [[amir]] of [[Kabul]], killed members of Gardner's delegation in Afghanistan and forced him to flee from Kabul to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through west Kafiristan.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt; On his second visit, Gardner briefly sojourned in northern Kafiristan and the [[Kunar Valley]] while returning from Yarkand.&lt;ref name="newby" /&gt;

In 1883, [[William Watts McNair]], a British surveyor on leave, explored the area disguised as a hakim, reporting on the journey later that year to the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

[[George Scott Robertson]], [[medical officer]] during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and later British political officer in the [[princely state]] of [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]], was given permission to explore the country of the Kafirs in 1890–91. He was the last outsider to visit the area and observe these people's polytheistic culture before their conversion to [[Islam]]. Robertson's 1896 account was entitled ''The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush''. Though some sub-groups such as the [[Kom people (Afghanistan)|Kom]] paid tribute to Chitral, the majority of Kafiristan was left on the Afghan side of the frontier in 1893, when large areas of tribal lands between Afghanistan and British India were divided into zones of control by the [[Durand Line]].

The territory between Afghanistan and [[British Raj|British India]] was [[Durand Line|demarcated between 1894 and 1896]]. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in outskirts of [[Mohmand Agency|Mohmand country]] and [[Bashgal Valley]] on outskirts of Kafiristan were demarcated by 1895 with an agreement reached on 9 April 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfrXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjueb-sYDZAhVErY8KHaUfAxQQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=An Historical Geography of Iran|author=[[Vasily Bartold]]|page=85|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdur Rahman wanted to force every community and tribal confederation with his single interpretation of Islam due to it being the only uniting factor. After the subjugation of [[Hazaras]], Kafiristan was the last remaining autonomus part.&lt;ref name=Katib&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWirPmwYPZAhUIu48KHUkJALwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Afghanistan's Islam: From Conversion to the Taliban|author=Nile Green|publisher=University of California Press|pages=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir Abdur Rahman Khan's forces invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895-1896 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through [[Badakhshan]] and from the east through [[Asmar, Afghanistan|Asmar]]. A small column also came from south-west through [[Laghman Province|Laghman]]. The Kafirs were resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans.&lt;ref name=Sykes1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA195&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWx732tIDZAhUGro8KHSkABdQQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=A History of Afghanistan: Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 1|author=[[Percy Sykes]]|publisher=Routledge|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kafirs were forcibly converted and some also converted to avoid the ''[[jizya]]''.&lt;ref name=Katib/&gt;

A few years after Robertson’s visit, in 1895–96, [[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] invaded and converted the Kafirs to Islam as a symbolic climax to his campaigns to bring the country under a centralised Afghan government. He had similarly subjugated the [[Hazara people]] in 1892–93. In 1896 Abdur Rahman Khan, who had thus conquered the region for Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Stephen. Afghanistan: A Military History from Alexander the Great to the Fall of the Taliban. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2002. Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; renamed the people the [[Nuristanis|Nuristani]] ("Enlightened Ones" in [[Persian language|Persian]]) and the land as [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]] ("Land of the Enlightened").

Kafiristan was full of steep and wooded valleys. It was famous for its precise wood carving, especially of cedar-wood pillars, carved doors, furniture (including "[[horn furniture|horn chairs]]") and statuary. Some of these pillars survive, as they were reused in mosques, but temples, shrines, and centers of local cults, with their wooden effigies and multitudes of ancestor figures were torched and burnt to the ground. Only a small fraction brought back to Kabul as spoils of this Islamic victory over infidels. These consisted of various wooden effigies of ancestral heroes and pre-Islamic commemorative chairs. Of the more than thirty wooden figures brought to Kabul in 1896 or shortly thereafter, fourteen went to the [[Kabul Museum]] and four to the [[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]] and the [[Musée de l'Homme]] located in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Edelberg, Lennart. "Statues de bois rapporte‚ es du Kafiristan aà Kabul apreàs la conquête de cette province par l'Emir Abdul Rahman en 1895/96," Arts Asiatiques 7, 1960, pp. 243–286&lt;/ref&gt;
Those in the Kabul Museum were badly damaged under the [[Taliban]] but have since been restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reportages-pictures.com/AFGHANISTAN/R20405%20KAkir%20sculpture%20from%20Nuristan%20destroyed%20by%20the%20talibans%20then%20restored/index.htm|title=R20405 KAkir sculpture from Nuristan destroyed by the talibans then restored|work=reportages-pictures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hundred [[Kata (people)|Kati Kafirs]], known as the "Red Kafirs" of the Bashgal Valley, fled across the border into Chitral but, uprooted from their homeland, they converted by the 1930s. They settled near the frontier in the valleys of [[Rumbur]], [[Bumboret]] and [[Urtsun]], which were then inhabited by the [[Kalash people|Kalasha tribe]] or the Black Kafirs. Only this group in the three valleys of [[Birir]], Bumburet and Rumbur escaped conversion, because they were located east of the Durand line in the [[princely state]] of [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]. After a decline in population caused by forced conversion in the 1970s, this region of Kafiristan in Pakistan, known as Kalasha Desh, has recently shown an increase in its population.

In early 1991, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]] government recognized the ''de facto'' autonomy of Nuristan and created a new province of that name from districts of [[Kunar Province]] and [[Lamghan Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXIRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|title=Afghanistan from the Cold War Through the War on Terror|author=[[Barnett Rubin|Barnett B.

'''Labor history''' or '''labour history''' is a sub-discipline of [[social history]] which specialises on the history of the [[working class]]es and the [[labor movement]]. The central concerns of labor historians include [[industrial relations]] and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of [[mass politics]] (especially the rise of [[socialism]]) and the social and cultural history of the [[Proletariat|industrial working classes]]. Labor historians may also concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from [[rural history]].

==Working-class movement==
Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as [[Luddism]] and [[Chartism]], the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this ''institutional'' approach included [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress. As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was "designed to service and celebrate the Labour movement."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Savage and Andrew Miles, ''The Remaking of the British Working Class, 1840-1940,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-07320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist influence==
{{Further|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Marxist historians}}

In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic:
:the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions’ [[winter of discontent]] [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the [[History of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like [[Raphael Samuel]] into the [[New Left Review]], a famous journal like [[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]], the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like [[Tony Benn]] joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan sees benefits: 
:In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labour and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, [[People's history|‘history from below’ so-called,]] and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the ‘condescension of posterity’; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Morgan tells of the downside as well:
: But the Marxist – or sometimes Trotskyist – emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissent–it was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff...when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt17w8h53.9.pdf?_=1467168515247 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history "from below" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963. {{ISBN|0-14-013603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for [[social history]] in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, [[C. L. R. James]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression ''within'' the working class.

Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers' organizations, and the "history from below" approach of the Marxist historians.

Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of [[social class|class]] itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a "language of class". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.

==United States==
{{Main article|Labor history of the United States}}
Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship  deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there's been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Walkowitz and Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, eds.

==Historiography==
Kirk (2010) surveys labor historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Marxist orbit, social historians paid a good deal of attention to labour history as well.&lt;ref&gt;John McIlroy, "Asa Briggs and the Emergence of Labour History in Post-War Britain." ''Labour History Review'' 77.2 (2012): 211-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, "in sharp decline," because:
:there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. '' A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939-2000'' (2005) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

A hollow chamber that began as a burial structure for Spiro's rulers became a cavity within the mound, about {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide, and allowed for almost perfect preservation of fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], and copper. The conditions in this hollow space were so favorable that objects made of perishable materials such as [[basket weaving|basketry]], woven fabric, lace, fur, and feathers were preserved inside it. Craig Mound has been called "an American [[Tutankhamun|King Tut's Tomb]]."

| [[Cyrus Thomas]] and [[John P. Rogan]] tested the site for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1883, where they discovered the "[[Rogan plates]]". But, the first well-documented archaeological inquiry at the site did not begin until the winter of 1925, conducted by [[Warren K. Moorehead]]. His excavations into Mound C at the site revealed a rich array of burial goods. These artifacts, along with the collections from [[Cahokia]], [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson]], and Spiro Mounds, would comprise the majority of the materials which archeologists used to define the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].

The pipe is from a distinctive red stone in the same style as several statuettes from the Cahokia site in Collinsville, Illinois.&lt;ref name=NPSGOV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/shil/mounds.htm|title=Shiloh Indian Mounds|accessdate =2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The censuses of the Habsburg Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, similarly to other pre-World War I  censuses in Europe, were based on the "first language" principle, i.e., the "mostly used language" of the person or family.&lt;ref&gt;New Europe College, Universitatea din București: Nation and National Ideology: Past, Present and Prospects : Proceedings of the International Symposium Held at the New Europe College, Bucharest.  p. 328-329, {{ISBN|9789739862493}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Magyarization''' (also ''Magyarisation'', ''Hungarization'', ''Hungarisation'', ''Hungarianization'', ''Hungarianisation''), after "Magyar"—the [[wikt:autonym#Noun|autonym]] of Hungarians—was an [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[acculturation]] process by which non-Hungarian nationals came to adopt the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] culture and language, either voluntarily or due to [[social pressure]], often in the form of a coercive policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/8910/1/umi-umd-5951.pdf|title=page60|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era of national awakening, the Hungarian intellectuals transposed the concepts of the so-called "Political Nation" and Nation State from the Western European countries (especially the principles of the similarly highly multiethnic 18th century France), which included the idea of linguistic and cultural assimilation of minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stefan Berger]] and Alexei Miller|title=Nationalizing Empires|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2015|page=409|ISBN=9789633860168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__9fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian Nationalities Law (1868) guaranteed that all citizens of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), whatever their nationality, constituted politically "''a single nation, the indivisible, unitary Hungarian nation''", and there could be no differentiation between them except in respect of the official usage of the current languages and then only insofar as necessitated by practical considerations.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; In spite of the law, the use of minority languages was banished almost entirely from administration and even justice.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Defiance of, or appeals to, the Nationalities Law met with derision or abuse.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Hungarian language]] was overrepresented in the primary schools, and almost all secondary education was in Hungarian.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

During the [[long nineteenth century]], the Hungarian politicians and intellectuals stood firmly on the contemporary liberal conception of nationality question, which based solely on [[individualism]]. With the idea of individualism, they tried to reduce the minority question into a simple linguistic rights question, thus they denied the collective nationality rights and any plans for ethnic autonomous territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Oskar Krejčí]]|title=Geopolitics of the Central European Region: The View from Prague and Bratislava|publisher= ÚPV SAV Slovak Academy of Science [[Institute of Political Science of SAS]] Published at lulu.com|page=281|year=2005|ISBN=9788022408523|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38ciAe4J4VMC&amp;pg=PA281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the state apparatus was entirely Hungarian in language, as were business and social life above the lowest levels.{{Copyright violation|date=September 2016}} The Magyarization of the towns had proceeded at an astounding rate. Nearly all middle-class [[Jews]] and [[Germans]] and many middle-class [[Slovaks]] and [[Ruthenes]] had been Magyarized.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The percentage of the population with Hungarian as its mother tongue grew from 46.6% in 1880 to 54.5% in 1910. The 1910 census (and the earlier censuses) did not register ethnicity, but mother tongue (and religion) instead, based on which it is sometimes subject to [[Treaty of Trianon#Criticism of the 1910 census|criticism]].
However, most of the Magyarization happened in the centre of Hungary and among the middle classes, who had access to education; and much of it was the direct result of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]]. It had hardly touched the rural populations of the periphery, and [[natural language|linguistic]] [[frontier]]s had not shifted significantly from the line on which they had stabilized a century earlier.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Hungary – Social and economic developments |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-34807/Hungary#411318.hook |accessdate=2008-05-20 |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process continued also in post-[[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] era. The political and cultural rights offered to interwar Hungary's ethnic minorities were more limited than their equivalents in any other country of [[East-Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=Rothschild&gt;{{Cite book|author=Joseph Rothschild|title=East Central Europe between the two World Wars|publisher=University of Washington Press|page=193|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; While anyone who resisted Magyarization was, indeed, subject to political and cultural handicaps, they were not subject to the kinds of civic and fiscal tricks (prejudicial court proceedings, overtaxation, biased application of social and economic legislation) that some of Hungary's neighbors often inflicted on their ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=Rothschild /&gt;

==Use of the term==
The term specifically applies to the policies that were enforced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?cd=5&amp;id=PjsTeamzeN8C&amp;dq=magyarization&amp;q=%22+forced+Magyarization+%22+#search_anchor |title=Western civilization: ideas, politics &amp; society. From the 1600s – Marvin Perry – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYjTmnd_gpwC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=magyarizations+++enforced&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=enforced%20magyarization&amp;f=false |title=Sixteen months of indecision: Slovak American viewpoints toward compatriots ... – Gregory C. Ference – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian part]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the 19th century and early 20th century, especially after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]],&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; and in particular after the rise in 1871 of the Count [[Menyhért Lónyay]] as head of the Hungarian government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to personal and geographic names, Magyarization refers to the replacement of a non-Hungarian name with a Hungarian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNzaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=magyarization+of+names&amp;dq=magyarization+of+names&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lzE4Tp7BCoPCswbcuRE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg |title=The policy of the Hungarian state concerning the Romanian church in ... – Mircea Păcurariu – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fglavred.info%2Farchive%2F2010%2F11%2F05%2F130109-5.html |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is often the case with policies intended to forge or bolster national identity in a state, Magyarization was perceived by other ethnic groups such as the [[Romanians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians]] ([[Rusyn people|Rusyns]] or [[Ukrainians]]), [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], etc., as aggression or active discrimination, especially where they formed the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNzaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Magyarization+oppression&amp;dq=Magyarization+oppression&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eTM4TvDrF47xsgaSxK3nDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw |title=The policy of the Hungarian state concerning the Romanian church in ... – Mircea Păcurariu – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_oLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Magyarization+oppression&amp;dq=Magyarization+oppression&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eTM4TvDrF47xsgaSxK3nDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg |title=The Central European Observer – Joseph Hanč, F.

==In the Middle Ages==
At the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Magyar conquest]] the Hungarian tribal alliance consisted of tribes of different ethnic backgrounds. There had to be a substantial [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] element (e.g. [[Kabars]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lendvai, The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The subjugated local population in the Hungarian settlement area (mainly the lowland territories) quickly merged with the Hungarians. In the period between the 9th and 13th centuries more groups of Turkic peoples migrated to Hungary ([[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] etc.). Their past presence is visible in the occurrence of Turkic settlement names.

According to [[History of the Székely people#Origins|one of the theories]], the ancestors of [[Székelys]] are [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] or Turkic [[Bulgars]] who were Magyarized in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis P. Hupchick. ''Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe''. [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 1995. p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the Székely people descended from a Hungarian-speaking "[[Late Avar]]" population or from ethnic Hungarians who received special privileges and developed their own consciousness.

As a reward for their achievements in wars, noble titles were granted to some Romanian [[Knez (title)|knez]]es. They entered Hungarian nobility, a part of them converting to Catholicism and their families being Magyarized: the Drágffy (Drăgoşteşti), [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadi]], Kendeffy (Cândeşti), Majláth (Mailat) or Jósika families were among the Romanian-origin Hungarian noble families.&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) László Makkai . [http://mek.oszk.hu/01800/01810/01810.pdf ''Colonizarea Transilvaniei''] (p.75)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Răzvan Theodorescu]].

==Historical context of the modern-times Magyarization==
Between 1000-1784 and 1790–1844, Latin was the language of administration, legislation and schooling in Kingdom of Hungary.{Cf. http://hungarianparliament.com/history/} [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780–90), a monarch influenced by the Enlightenment sought to centralize control of the empire and to rule it as an enlightened despot.&lt;ref name=Country&gt;{{cite book|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |title=A Country Study: Hungary – Hungary under the Habsburgs |accessdate= 2008-11-30 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work=Federal Research Division |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; More than two and one half centuries following upon Martin Luther's "95 Theses" (1517) that in Central Europe, finally receptive of Protestantism, Emperor Joseph ll decreed that [[German language|German]] replace [[Latin]] as the empire&amp;apos;s official language.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; In 1790, the change in administrative and next official language had signaled the narrowing terminus of the Holy Roman Empire. This centralization/homogenization struggle was not unique to Joseph II, it was a trend that one could observe all around Europe with the birth of the enlightened idea of [[Nation State]].

Hungarians perceived Joseph's language reform as German [[cultural hegemony]], and they reacted by insisting on the right to use their own tongue.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; As a result, Hungarian lesser nobles sparked a renaissance of the [[Hungarian language]] and culture.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; The lesser nobles questioned the loyalty of the magnates, of whom less than half were ethnic Magyars, and even those had become [[French language|French-]] and German-speaking courtiers.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt;

The Magyarization policy actually took shape as early as the 1830s, when Hungarian started replacing Latin and German in education. Magyarization lacked any religious, racial or otherwise exclusionary component. Language was the only issue. The eagerness of the Hungarian government in its Magyarization efforts was comparable to that of tsarist [[Russification]] from the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Finno-Ugric republics and the Russian state, by Rein Taagepera  1999. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1840s [[Lajos Kossuth]] pleaded in the newspaper ''[[Pesti Hirlap]]'' for rapid Magyarization: "Let us hurry, let us hurry to Magyarize the Croats, the Romanians, and the Saxons, for otherwise we shall perish".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Lupaș]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_0ppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Croats,+the+Romanians+and+the+saxons%22&amp;dq=%22the+Croats,+the+Romanians+and+the+saxons%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PenTUtriDoSmhAeR-4HACg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA The Hungarian Policy of Magyarization] (p. 14). The Center for Transylvanians Studies&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842 he argued that Hungarian had to be the exclusive language in public life.&lt;ref name="oszk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/357.html|title=The Hungarian Liberal Opposition's Approach to Nationalities and Social Reform|publisher=mek.oszk.hu|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that ''in one country it is impossible to speak in a hundred different languages. There must be one language and in Hungary this must be Hungarian''.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Deme.

Sugar, Péter Hanák, [[Tibor Frank]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SKwmGQCT0MAC&amp;pg=PA200 ''A History of Hungary'']&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the Magyarization of non-Hungarians on the basis of the alleged "moral and intellectual supremacy" of the Hungarian population. But he felt that first Hungary itself must be made worthy of emulation if Magyarization was to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Adolf Kann, Stanley B. Winters, Joseph Held. [https://books.google.com/books?id=b_xnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Hungarian+population's+moral+and+intellectual+supremacy%22&amp;dq=%22the+Hungarian+population's+moral+and+intellectual+supremacy%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pe3TUtjuCJPxygP2nYGQCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA ''Intellectual and Social Developments in the Habsburg Empire from Maria Theresa to World War'']&lt;/ref&gt; However the radical view on Magyarization of Kossuth gained more popular support than the moderate one of Széchenyi.&lt;ref&gt;John D Nagle, Alison Mahr.

The army of the Russian Empire and the Austrian forces proved too powerful for the Hungarian army, and General [[Artúr Görgey]] surrendered in August 1849.

The Magyar national reawakening therefore triggered national revivals among the [[Slovak people|Slovak]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] minorities within [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Transylvania]], who felt threatened by both German and Magyar cultural hegemony.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; These national revivals later blossomed into the nationalist movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that contributed to the [[Austria-Hungary#Dissolution of the Empire in 1918|empire's ultimate collapse]].&lt;ref name=Country/&gt;

The term Magyarization is used in regards to the national policies put into use by the government of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which was part of the Habsburg Empire. The beginning of this process dates to the late 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Pástor, Zoltán, ''Dejiny Slovenska: Vybrané kapitoly''. Banská Bystrica: Univerzita Mateja Bela. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and was intensified after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which increased the power of the Hungarian government within the newly formed [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Riff, ''The Face of Survival: Jewish Life in Eastern Europe Past and Present'', Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; some of them had little desire to be declared a national minority like in other cultures. However, Jews in Hungary appreciated the emancipation in Hungary at a time when anti-semitic laws were still applied in Russia and Romania. Large minorities were concentrated in various regions of the kingdom, where they formed significant majorities. In [[Transylvania]] proper (1867 borders), the 1910 census finds 55.08% Romanian-speakers, 34.2% Hungarian-speakers, and 8.71% German-speakers.
[[Upper Hungary|In the north of the Kingdom]], Slovaks and Ruthenians formed an ethnic majority also, in the southern regions the majority were South Slavic Croats, Serbs and Slovenes and in the western regions the majority were Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of Magyarization did not succeed in imposing the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of a bygone era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/404.html Religious Denominations and Nationalities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929224604/http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/404.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language [[surname]] as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.genealogy.ro/cont/13.htm |title=Magyarization process |publisher=Genealogy.ro |date=1904-06-05 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1850 and 1910 the ethnic Hungarian population increased by 106.7%, while the increase of other ethnic groups was far slower: Serbians and Croatians 38.2%, Romanians 31.4% and Slovaks 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/igl.geschichte/vocelka/SS2002/vo_ss2002_1006.htm|title=IGL - SS 2002 - ao.

The Magyarization of Budapest was rapid&lt;ref name="Lukacs"&gt;[[John Lukacs]]. ''Budapest 1900: A Historical Portrait of a City and Its Culture'' (1994) p.102&lt;/ref&gt; and it implied not only the assimilation of the old inhabitants, but also the Magyarization of the immigrants. In the capital of Hungary, in 1850 56% of the residents were Germans and only 33% Hungarians, and in 1910 almost 90% declared themselves Magyars.&lt;ref&gt;István Deák. ''Assimilation and nationalism in east central Europe during the last century of Habsburg rule'', Russian and East European Studies Program, University of Pittsburgh, 1983 (p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution had benefic influence to the Hungarian culture and literature.&lt;ref name="Lukacs"/&gt;

According to census data, the Hungarian population of Transylvania increased from 24.9% in 1869 to 31.6% in 1910. In the same time, the percentage of Romanian population decreased from 59.0% to 53.8% and the percentage of German population decreased from 11.9% to 10.7%. Changes were more significant in cities with predominantly German and Romanian population. For example, the percentage of Hungarian population increased in [[Braşov]] from 13.4% in 1850 to 43.43% in 1910, meanwhile the Romanian population decreased from 40% to 28.71% and the German population from 40.8% to 26.41%.

The first Hungarian government after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the 1867–1871 [[liberalism|liberal]] government led by Count [[Gyula Andrássy]] and sustained by [[Ferenc Deák]] and his followers, passed the 1868 Nationality Act, that declared "all citizens of Hungary form, politically, one nation, the indivisible unitary Hungarian nation (''nemzet''), of which every citizen of the country, whatever his personal nationality (''nemzetiség''), is a member equal in rights." The Education Act, passed the same year, shared this view as the Magyars simply being ''primus inter pares'' ("first among equals"). At this time ethnic minorities "de jure" had a great deal of cultural and linguistic autonomy, including in education, religion, and local government.&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after education minister Baron [[József Eötvös]] died in 1871, and in Andrássy became [[List of foreign ministers of Austria-Hungary|imperial foreign minister]], Deák withdrew from active politics and [[Menyhért Lónyay]] was appointed [[prime minister of Hungary]]. He became steadily more allied with the Magyar gentry, and the notion of a Hungarian political nation increasingly became one of a Magyar nation. "[A]ny political or social movement which challenged the hegemonic position of the Magyar ruling classes was liable to be repressed or charged with 'treason'..., 'libel' or 'incitement of national hatred'. This was to be the fate of various [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[South Slavs|South Slav]] [e.g. [[Serbs|Serb]]], [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Ruthenes|Ruthene]] cultural societies and nationalist parties from 1876 onward..."&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 363–364.&lt;/ref&gt; All of this only intensified after 1875, with the rise of [[Kálmán Tisza]],&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; who as [[List of Interior Ministers of Hungary#Austria-Hungary|minister of the Interior]] had ordered the closing of [[Matica slovenská]] on 6 April 1875. Until 1890, [[Kálmán Tisza]], when he served as prime minister, brought the [[Slovaks]] many other measures which prevented them from keeping pace with the progress of other [[European nations]].&lt;ref name="Struggle for Survival"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirschbaum | first = Stanislav J. | authorlink =  | title = A History of Slovakia: The Struggle for Survival | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Palgrave Macmillan]]; [[St. Martin's Press]] | date = March 1995 | location = New York | url = http://us.macmillan.com/ahistoryofslovakia | isbn = 978-0-312-10403-0 | page = a136 b139 c139 | access-date = 2 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080925041206/http://us.macmillan.com/ahistoryofslovakia | archive-date = 25 September 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, number of non-Hungarians that lived in the Kingdom of Hungary was much larger than a number of ethnic Hungarians. According to the 1787 data, the population of the Kingdom of Hungary numbered 2,322,000 Hungarians (29%) and 5,681,000 non-Hungarians (71%). In 1809, the population numbered 3,000,000 Hungarians (30%) and 7,000,000 non-Hungarians (70%). As an increasingly intense Magyarization policy was implemented after 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 362–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hungarian 1849 bank note.jpg|thumb|320px|A so-called "''[[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] banknote''" from 1849 (during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution]]) with multilingual inscriptions.]]

Although in [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Serbs|Serbian]] history writing administrative and often repressive Magyarization is usually singled out as the main factor accountable for the dramatic change in the ethnic composition of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 19th century, it should be noted that spontaneous assimilation was also an important factor. In this regard, it must be pointed out that large territories of central and southern Kingdom of Hungary lost their previous, predominantly Magyar population during the numerous wars fought by the [[Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires in the 16th and 17th centuries. These empty lands were repopulated, by administrative measures adopted by the Vienna Court especially during the 18th century, by Hungarians and Slovaks from the northern part of the Kingdom that avoided the devastation (see also [[Royal Hungary]]), Swabians, Serbs (Serbs were majority in most southern parts of the Pannonian Plain during Ottoman rule, i.e. before those Habsburg administrative measures), Croats and Romanians. Various ethnic groups lived side by side (this ethnic heterogeneity is preserved until today in certain parts of [[Vojvodina]], [[Bačka]] and [[Banat]]). After 1867, Hungarian became the [[lingua franca]] on this territory in the interaction between ethnic communities, and individuals who were born in mixed marriages between two non-Magyars often grew a full-fledged allegiance to the Hungarian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Ács, Zoltán: ''Nemzetiségek a történelmi Magyarországon''. Kossuth, Budapest, 1986. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course since Latin was the official language until 1844 and the country was directly governed from Vienna (which excluded any large-scale governmental assimilation policy from the Hungarian side before the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the factor of spontaneous assimilation should be given due weight in any analysis relating to the demographic tendencies of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other key factor in mass ethnic changes is that between 1880 and 1910 about 3&amp;nbsp;million &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200126/http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Austro-Hungarians migrated to the [[United States]] alone. More than half of them were from Hungary (1.5&amp;nbsp;million+ or about 10% of the total population) alone.&lt;ref name="reframed"&gt;Rogers Bruebaker: ''Nationalism Reframed'', New York, Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosi Goldshṭain, Joseph Goldstein: Jewish history in modern times&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million that fled to the US (2/3 of them or about a million were ethnically non Hungarians) mainly Romanians and Serbs had migrated to their newly established mother states in large numbers, like the [[Principality of Serbia]] or the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Kingdom of Romania]], who proclaimed their independence in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Amongst them were such noted people, like the early aviator [[Aurel Vlaicu]] (represented on the 50 [[Romanian leu|Romanian lei]] banknote) or famous writer [[Liviu Rebreanu]] (first illegally in 1909, then legally in 1911) or [[Ion Ivanovici]]. Also many fled to [[Western Europe]] or other parts of the [[Americas]].

===Allegation of violent oppression===
{{See also|Černová massacre}}
Many Slovak intellectuals and activists (such as [[Janko Kráľ]]) were imprisoned or even sentenced to death during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyklopédia spisovateľov Slovenska''. Bratislava: Obzor, 1984.{{Context inline|date=November 2009}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the incidents that shocked European public opinion&lt;ref name="holec"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holec | first = Roman | authorlink = | title = Tragédia v Černovej a slovenská spoločnosť | publisher = Matica slovenská | year=  1997 | location = Martin | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Černová massacre|Černová (Csernova) massacre]] when 15 people were killed&lt;ref name="holec"/&gt; and 52 injured in 1907. The massacre caused the Kingdom of Hungary to lose prestige in the eyes of the world when English historian [[Robert William Seton-Watson|R. W. Seton-Watson]], Norwegian writer [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] and Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]] championed this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYjTmnd_gpwC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Bj%C3%B8rnson%20%C4%8Cernov%C3%A1&amp;hl=sk&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=Seton-Watson&amp;f=false |title=Sixteen months of indecision: Slovak American viewpoints toward compatriots ... – Gregory C. Ference – Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case being a proof for the violence of Magyarization is disputed, partly because the sergeant who ordered the shooting and all the shooters were ethnic [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and partly because of the controversial figure of [[Andrej Hlinka]].&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers who condemned forced Magyarization in printed publications were likely to be put in jail either on charges of ''treason'' or for ''incitement of national hatred''.&lt;ref name=Bideleux&gt;Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change'', Routledge, 1998, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Mali katekizmus (1894).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Bilingual [[catechism]] textbook from 1894.]]

Schools funded by churches and communes had the right to provide education in minority languages. These church-funded schools, however, were mostly founded before 1867, that is, in different socio-political circumstances. In practice, the majority of students in commune-funded schools who were native speakers of minority languages were instructed exclusively in Hungarian.

Beginning with the 1879 Primary Education Act and the 1883 Secondary Education Act, the Hungarian state made more efforts to reduce the use of non-Magyar languages, in strong violation of the 1868 Nationalities Law.&lt;ref name=Bideleux/&gt;

The number of minority-language schools was steadily decreasing: in the period between 1880 and 1913, when the number of Hungarian-only schools almost doubled, the number of minority language-schools almost halved.&lt;ref name="Romsics"&gt;Romsics, Ignác. ''Magyarország története a huszadik században'' ("A History of Hungary in the 20th Century"), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Transylvanian Romanians had more Romanian-language schools under the Austro-Hungarian Empire rule than there were in the Romanian Kingdom itself. Thus, for example, in 1880, in Austro-Hungarian Empire there were 2,756 schools teaching exclusively in the Romanian language, while in the Kingdom of Romania there were only 2,505 (The Romanian Kingdom gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire only two years before, in 1878).&lt;ref name="Raffay"&gt;Raffay Ernő: A vajdaságoktól a birodalomig-Az újkori Románia története = From voivodates to the empire-History of modern Romania, JATE Kiadó, Szeged, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The process of Magyarization culminated in 1907 with the ''lex Apponyi'' (named after education minister [[Albert Apponyi]]) which forced all primary school children to read, write and count in Hungarian for the first four years of their education. From 1909 religion also had to be taught in Hungarian.&lt;ref name=SlovakiaInHistory&gt;{{cite book|last=Teich|first=Mikuláš|title=Slovakia in History|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrC1HFgjJxsC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=census+1910+hungary+manipulated&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h_FdTu2XKcKo8QPkusmbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=census%201910%20hungary%20manipulated&amp;f=false|author2=Dušan Kováč |author3=Martin D.

The effect of Magyarization on the education system in Hungary was very significant, as can be seen from the official statistics submitted by the Hungarian government to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] (formally, all the [[Jewish people]] of the kingdom were considered as Hungarians, who had higher ratio in tertiary education than Christians):

===Election system===
The census system of the post-1867 Kingdom of Hungary was unfavourable to those of non-Hungarian nationality. According to the 1874 election law, which remained unchanged until 1918, only the upper 5.9% to 6.5% of the whole population had voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-archiv.parlament.hu/fotitkar/angol/book_2011.pdf, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; That effectively excluded almost the whole of the peasantry and the working class from Hungarian political life. The percentage of those on low incomes was higher among other nationalities than among the Magyars, with the exception of Germans who were generally richer. From a Hungarian point of view, the structure of the settlement{{clarify|date=December 2013}} system was based on differences in earning potential and wages. The Hungarians and Germans were much more urbanised than Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1900, nearly a third of the deputies were elected by fewer than 100 votes, and close to two-thirds were elected by fewer than 1000 votes.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1911"&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Corruption and reform in Hungary'', London, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvania had an even worse representation: the more Romanian a county was, the fewer voters it had. Out of the Transylvanian deputies sent to Budapest, 35 represented the 4 mostly Hungarian counties and the major towns (which together formed 20% of the population), whereas only 30 deputies represented the other 72%{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of the population, which was predominantly Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''A history of the Roumanians'', Cambridge, University Press, 1934, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="castellan89"&gt;Georges Castellan, ''A history of the Romanians'', Boulder, 1989, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, even the electorate that elected only one-third of the deputies had a non-proportional ethnic composition.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1911"/&gt; The Magyars who made up 54.5% of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary represented a 60.2% majority of the electorate. Ethnic Germans made up 10.4% of the population and 13.0% of the electorate. The participation of other ethnic groups was as follows: Slovaks (10.7% in population, 10.4% in the electorate), Romanians (16.1% in population, 9.9% in the electorate), Rusyns (2.5% in population, 1.7% in the electorate), Croats (1.1% in population, 1.0% in the electorate), Serbs (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate), and others (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate).

Officially, Hungarian electoral laws never contained any legal discrimination based on nationality or language. The high [[census suffrage]] was not uncommon in other European countries in the 1860s but later the countries of Western Europe gradually lowered and at last abolished their census suffrage. That never happened in the Kingdom of Hungary, although electoral reform was one of the main topics of political debates in the last decades before World War I.

===The Magyarization of personal names===
[[Image:Bánffy Dezső Ellinger.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Prime Minister [[Dezső Bánffy]] (1895–1899), strong supporter of Magyarization]]
Hungarian authorities put constant pressure upon all non-Hungarians to Magyarize their names and the ease with which this could be done gave rise to the nickname of ''Crown Magyars'' (the price of registration being one korona).&lt;ref name="setonwatson1934"&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''A history of the Roumanians'', Cambridge, University Press, 1934, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the "Central Society for Name Magyarization" (Központi Névmagyarositó Társaság) was founded in 1881 in [[Budapest]]. The aim of this private society was to provide advice and guidelines for those who wanted to Magyarize their surnames. [[Simon Telkes]] became the chairman of the society, and professed that "one can achieve being accepted as a true son of the nation by adopting a national name". The society began an advertising campaign in the newspapers and sent out circular letters. They also made a proposal to lower the fees for changing one's name. The proposal was accepted by the Parliament and the fee was lowered from 5 [[Forint]]s to 50 [[Krajcár]]s. After this the name changes peaked in 1881 and 1882 (with 1261 and 1065 registered name changes), and continued in the following years at an average of 750–850 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.hu/00000/00060/html/074/pc007478.html|title=A Pallas nagy lexikona|author=|date=|website=www.elib.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dezső Bánffy|Bánffy]] administration there was another increase, reaching a maximum of 6,700 applications in 1897, mostly due to pressure from authorities and employers in the government sector. Statistics show that between 1881 and 1905 alone, 42,437 surnames were Magyarized, although this represented less than 0.5% of the total non-Hungarian population of the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1934" /&gt; Voluntary Magyarization of German or Slavic-sounding surnames remained a typical phenomenon in Hungary during the whole course of the 20th century.

According to Hungarian statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{hu icon}} Kozma, István, [http://www.historia.hu/archivum/2000/000506kozma.htm A névmagyarosítások története. A családnév-változtatások], ''História'' (2000/05-06)&lt;/ref&gt; and considering the huge number of assimilated persons between 1700 and 1944 (~3&amp;nbsp;million) only 340,000–350,000 names were Magyarised between 1815 and 1944; this happened mainly inside the Hungarian-speaking area. One Jewish name out of 17 was Magyarised, in comparison with other nationalities: one out of 139 (Catholic) -427{{clarify|date=December 2013}} (Lutheran) for Germans and 170 (Catholic) -330 (Lutheran) for Slovaks.

The attempts to assimilate the Carpatho-Rusyns started in the late 18th century, but their intensity grew considerably after 1867. The agents of forced Magyarization endeavored to rewrite the history{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of the Carpatho-Rusyns with the purpose of subordinating them to Magyars by eliminating their own national and religious identity. Carpatho-Rusyns were pressed to add Western Rite practices to their Eastern Christian traditions and efforts were made to replace the Slavonic liturgical language with Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;D. Oliver Herbel.

Oxford University Press (2013). p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Magyarization of place names===
Together with Magyarization of personal names and surnames, the exclusive use of the Hungarian forms of place names, instead of multilingual usage, was also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHMEIRM84ScC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Magyarization+of+personal+names+and+surnames,+geographical+names&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gDI4TsnFAoT2sga4yMEa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ethnizität, Moderne und Enttraditionalisierung|first=Mosheh|last=Tsuḳerman|date=17 May 2018|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that had not been known under Hungarian names in the past, new Hungarian names were invented and used in administration instead of the former original non-Hungarian names. Examples of places where non-Hungarian origin names were replaced with newly invented Hungarian names are: Szvidnik&amp;nbsp;– Felsővízköz (in Slovak [[Svidník]], now [[Slovakia]]), Sztarcsova&amp;nbsp;– Tárcsó (in Serbian [[Starčevo]], now [[Serbia]]), Lyutta&amp;nbsp;– Havasköz (in Ruthenian [[Lyuta]], now [[Ukraine]]), Bruck&amp;nbsp;– Királyhida (now [[Bruck an der Leitha]], Austria).&lt;ref name=LelkesHelysegnev&gt;Lelkes György: Magyar helységnév-azonosító szótár, Talma Könyvkiadó, Baja, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (although Bruck and Királyhida were two separate towns, separated by the boundary formed by the river Leitha)

==Migration==
During the dualism era, there was an internal migration of segments of the ethnically non-Hungarian population to the Kingdom of Hungary's central predominantly Hungarian counties and to Budapest where they assimilated. The ratio of ethnically non-Hungarian population in the Kingdom was also dropping due to their overrepresentation among the migrants to foreign countries, mainly to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;István Rácz, ''A paraszti migráció és politikai megítélése Magyarországon 1849–1914.'' Budapest: 1980. p. 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Hungarians, the largest ethnic group in the Kingdom representing 45.5% of the population in 1900, accounted for only 26.2% of the emigrants, while non-Hungarians (54.5%) accounted for 72% from 1901 to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Júlia Puskás, ''Kivándorló Magyarok az Egyesült Államokban, 1880–1914.'' Budapest: 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} The areas with the highest emigration were the northern mostly Slovak inhabited counties of [[Sáros county|Sáros]], [[Szepes county|Szepes]], [[Zemplén county|Zemlén]], and from [[Ung county]] where a substantial [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] population lived. In the next tier were some of the southern counties including [[Bács-Bodrog]], [[Torontál]], [[Temes County|Temes]], and [[Krassó-Szörény]] largely inhabited by Serbs, Romanians, and Germans, as well as the northern mostly Slovak counties of [[Árva (county)|Árva]] and [[Gömör-Kishont]], and the central Hungarian inhabited county of [[Veszprém (former county)|Veszprém]]. The reasons for emigration were mostly economic.&lt;ref&gt;László Szarka, ''Szlovák nemzeti fejlõdés-magyar nemzetiségi politika 1867–1918.'' Bratislava: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Additionally, some may have wanted to avoid Magyarization or the draft, but direct evidence of other than economic motivation among the emigrants themselves is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Aranka Terebessy Sápos, "Középső-Zemplén migrációs folyamata a dualizmus korában." ''Fórum Társadalomtudományi Szemle'', III, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom's administration welcomed the development as yet another instrument of increasing the ratio of ethnic Hungarians at home.&lt;ref&gt;László Szarka, ''A szlovákok története.'' Budapest: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}}

The Hungarian government made a contract with the English-owned [[Cunard Line|Cunard Steamship Company]] for a direct passenger line from [[Rijeka]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Its purpose was to enable the government to increase the business transacted through their medium.&lt;ref&gt;James Davenport Whelpey, ''The Problem of the Immigrant.'' London: 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}}

By 1914, a total number of 3&amp;nbsp;million had emigrated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm Immigration push and pull factors, conditions of living and restrictive legistration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200126/http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, UFR d'ETUDES ANGLOPHONES, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; of whom about 25% returned. This process of returning was halted by World War I and the [[partition of Austria-Hungary]]. The majority of the emigrants came from the most indigent social groups, especially from the agrarian sector. Magyarization did not cease after the collapse of Austria-Hungary but has continued within the borders of the post-WW-I Hungary throughout most of the 20th century and resulted in high decrease of numbers of ethnic Non-Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;Loránt Tilkovszky, ''A szlovákok történetéhez Magyarországon 1919–1945.

==Jews==
[[File:Hatvany-Deutsch Sándor.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Sándor Hatvany-Deutsch]], a Jewish entrepreneur, who was created baron by King [[Francis Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] in 1908]]
In the nineteenth century, the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] Jews were located mainly in the cities and larger towns. They arose in the environment of the latter period of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] - generally a good period for upwardly mobile Jews, especially those of modernizing inclinations. In the Hungarian portion of the Empire, most Jews (nearly all Neologs and even most of the Orthodox) adopted the Hungarian language as their primary language and viewed themselves as "[[Magyars]] of the Jewish persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Riff, The Face of Survival: Jewish Life in Eastern Europe Past and Present, Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish minority which to the extent it is attracted to a secular culture is usually attracted to the secular culture in power, was inclined to gravitate toward the cultural orientation of Budapest.&lt;ref name=Indiana&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of East Central Europe Between the World Wars |last=Mendelsohn |first=Ezra |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-253-20418-6 |url= |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The same factor prompted Prague Jews to adopt an Austrian cultural orientation, and at least some Vilna Jews to adopt a Russian orientation.&lt;ref name=Indiana/&gt;)

After the [[Jewish Emancipation#Dates of emancipation|emancipation of Jews in 1867]], the Jewish population of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (as well as the ascending [[German people|German]] population)&lt;ref&gt;Erényi Tibor: A zsidók története Magyarországon, Változó Világ, Budapest, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; actively embraced Magyarization, because they saw it as an opportunity for [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] without conceding their religion. (We also have to point out that in the case of the Jewish people that process had been preceded by a process of [[Germanization]]&lt;ref name=Indiana/&gt; earlier performed by Habsburg rulers). Stephen Roth writes, "Hungarian Jews were opposed to [[Zionism]] because they hoped that somehow they could achieve equality with other Hungarian citizens, not just in law but in fact, and that they could be integrated into the country as Hungarian Israelites. The word 'Israelite' ({{lang-hu|Izraelita}}) denoted only religious affiliation and was free from the ethnic or national connotations usually attached to the term 'Jew'. Hungarian Jews attained remarkable achievements in business, culture and less frequently even in politics. During the cabinet of pm. [[István Tisza]] three Jewish men were appointed as ministers. The first was Samu Hazai (Minister of War), János Harkányi (Minister of Trade) and János Teleszky (Minister of Finance). But even the most successful Jews were not fully accepted by the majority of the Magyars as one of their kind—as the events following the [[Nazism|Nazi]] German [[Operation Margarethe|invasion of the country]] in [[World War II]] so tragically demonstrated."  &lt;!-- punctuation follows the book cited, please leave it. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Stephen.

Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s and early 1940s [[Budapest]] was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for Slovak, German and Austrian Jewish refugees&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005264 |title=Budapest |accessdate=2008-06-02 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404223157/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005264 |archivedate=4 April 2003 |dead-url=yes |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a center of Hungarian Jewish cultural life.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

In 2006 the Company for Hungarian Jewish Minority could not collect 1000 signatures for a petition to declare Hungarian Jews a minority&lt;ref name="index"&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/belfold/zskis6272/ Index - Nem lesz kisebbség a zsidóság&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; even though there are at least 100,000 Jews in the country. The official Hungarian Jewish religious organization, [[Mazsihisz]] advised not to vote for the new status because they think that Jews identify themselves as a religious group, not as a 'national minority'. There was no real control throughout the process and non-Jewish people could also sign the petition.&lt;ref name="index"/&gt;

==Notable dates==
*1844&amp;nbsp;– Hungarian is gradually introduced for all civil records (kept at local parishes until 1895). German became an official language again after the 1848 revolution, but the laws reverted in 1881 yet again. From 1836 to 1881, 14,000 families had their name Magyarized in the area of Banat alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
*1849&amp;nbsp;– Hungarian Parliament during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]] acknowledged and enacted foremost the ethnic and minority rights in the world.
*1874&amp;nbsp;– All Slovak secondary schools (created in 1860) were closed. Also the [[Matica slovenská]] was closed down in April 1875. The building was taken over by the Hungarian government and the property of Matica slovenská, which according to the statutes belonged to the [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]], was confiscated by the [[Béla Wenckheim|Prime Minister's office]], with the justification that, according to Hungarian laws, there did not exist a [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]].&lt;ref name="Struggle for Survival"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2013}}

*1883&amp;nbsp;– The [[Upper Hungary Magyar Educational Society]], FEMKE, was created. The society was founded to propagate Magyar values and Magyar education in [[Upper Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Struggle for Survival"/&gt;
*1897&amp;nbsp;– The Bánffy law of the villages is ratified. According to this law, all officially used village names in the Hungarian Kingdom had to be in Hungarian language.
*1898&amp;nbsp;– Simon Telkes publishes the book "How to Magyarize family names".
*1907&amp;nbsp;– The Apponyi educational law made Hungarian a compulsory subject in all schools in the Kingdom of Hungary. This also extended to confessional and communal schools, which had the right to provide instruction in a minority language as well. "All pupils regardless of their native language must be able to express their thoughts in Hungarian both in spoken and in written form at the end of fourth grade [~ at the age of 10 or 11]"&lt;ref name="Romsics" /&gt;
*1907&amp;nbsp;– The [[Černová massacre]] in present-day northern Slovakia, a controversial event in which 15 people were killed during a clash between a group of gendarmes and local villagers.

==Post-Trianon Hungary==
A considerable number of other nationalities remained within the frontiers of the post-Trianon Hungary:

According to the 1920 census 10.4% of the population spoke one of the minority languages as their mother language:

*551,212 German (6.9%)
*141,882 Slovak (1.8%)
*23,760 Romanian (0.3%)
*36,858 Croatian (0.5%)
*23,228 [[Bunjevac]] and [[Šokci]] (0.3%)
*17,131 Serb (0.2%)

The number of bilingual people was much higher, for example
*1,398,729 people spoke German (17%)
*399,176 people spoke Slovak (5%)
*179,928 people spoke Croatian (2.2%)
*88,828 people spoke Romanian (1.1%).

Hungarian was spoken by 96% of the total population and was the mother language of 89%.

In interwar period, Hungary expanded its university system so the administrators could be produced to carry out the Magyarization of the lost territories for the case they were regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7TgkO8utHIC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=treaty+of+trianon+magyarization&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dQl_TYzfKs3Nsgagraz3Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=%22lost%20territories%20once%20they%20were%22&amp;f=false |title=Nationalism and territory: constructing group identity in Southeastern Europe – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the Roman Catholic clerics dwelled on Magyarization in the school system even more strongly than did the civil service.&lt;ref name=Rothschild/&gt;

The percentage and the absolute number of all non-Hungarian nationalities decreased in the next decades, although the total population of the country increased. Bilingualism was also disappearing. The main reasons of this process were both spontaneous assimilation and the deliberate Magyarization policy of the state.&lt;ref&gt;András Gerő, James Patterson, Enikő Koncz: Modern Hungarian society in the making: the unfinished experience, p. 214, Oxford University Press, US, 1995 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XguLA9wLqloC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=social+life+in+hungary+during+the+dual+monarchy+assimilation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tWVBT4HvE5DRsgaV5eyCBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=assimilated&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities made up 8% of the total population in 1930 and 7% in 1941 (on the post-Trianon territory).

After World War II about [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|200,000 Germans were deported to Germany]] according to the decree of the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Under the [[Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange|forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary]], approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Mad̕arská otázka v Česko-Slovensku, 1944-1948|trans-title=Hungarian Question in Czechoslovakia|last=Bobák |first=Ján |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1996|publisher= Matica slovenská|language= Slovak |ref=harv|isbn=978-80-7090-354-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these population movements Hungary became an ethnically almost homogeneous country except the rapidly growing number of [[Romani people]] in the second half of the 20th century.

After the [[First Vienna Award]] which gave [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], a Magyarization campaign was started by the Hungarian government in order to remove Slavic nationalism from Catholic Churches and society. There were reported interferences in the Uzhorod (Ungvár) Greek Catholic seminary, and the Hungarian-language schools excluded all pro-Slavic students.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lawrence Zugger: [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnUnJ7X10BMC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=%22launched+a+Magyarization+campaign+to+eliminate+Slavic%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f6WxUqXQK4qqhQepu4GoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22launched%20a%20Magyarization%20campaign%20to%20eliminate%20Slavic%22&amp;f=false ''The Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Empire from Lenin Through Stalin'']. Syracuse University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chris Hann, most of the [[Greek Catholic]]s in Hungary are of Rusyn and Romanian origin, but they have been almost totally Magyarized.&lt;ref&gt;Hann, C. M. (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OLDgiWvqPqcC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=%22rusyn+and+romanian+origin+but%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i9mwUrqjIaf8ygOGp4DABQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rusyn%20and%20romanian%20origin%20but%22&amp;f=false ''The Postsocialist Religious Question''].

Their number increased drastically in the 17-18th centuries, when during the conflict with Protestants many{{Quantify|date=December 2013}} Hungarians joined the [[Greek Catholic Church]], and so adopted the Byzantine Rite rather than the Latin. In the end of the 18th century, the [[Hungarian Greek Catholic Church|Hungarian Greek Catholics]] themselves started to translate their rites to Hungarian and created a movement to create their own diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Katolikus Lexikon (Hungarian Catholic Lexicon): Görögkatolikusok (Greek Catholics) [http://lexikon.katolikus.hu/G/g%C3%B6r%C3%B6gkatolikusok.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}}

==Background==
The immediate cause of the riot was a [[hit-and-run]] accident just before midnight on 23 June 1991 on the pedestrian crossing at Piłsudskiego and Zuzanny Morawskiej streets.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; A speeding luxury car driven by seventeen-year-old Roman Packowski of [[Romani people|Romani ethnicity]] hit and seriously injured two young pedestrians, killing one of them.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; The driver fled the scene and hid from the police.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; He was later convinced by the Roma elders to turn himself in.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; Soon after the accident the local radio station informed that the driver had fled the scene. This claim was in fact true;&lt;ref name="cbos"&gt;Anna Giza-Poleszczuk i Jan Poleszczuk, "Cyganie i Polacy w Mławie konflikt etniczny czy społeczny?" prepared for [[CBOS]], Warszawa, December 1992, pages 24 to 29&lt;/ref&gt; however, the driver fled after people who witnessed the accident already identified his vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Beata Klimkiewicz (7 December 1999), [http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=1127  The pogrom in Mława, Poland: no media influence on justice.] ERRC.org&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two days the driver and his car were hidden among the local [[Romani people|Roma community]].&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbos"/&gt;

The accident victim who died from his injuries was the 21-year-old Jaroslaw Pinczewski. The mayor of Mława, Adam Chmielinski informed that he died at the scene.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; Other victim, seventeen-year old Katarzyna Zakrzewska, suffered permanent physical incapacitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cahn |first=Claude |editor=Claude Cahn |title=Roma rights: race, justice, and strategies for equality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8E9u2aD4fYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22in+the+Polish+town+of+Mlawa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nZVATeGCHImChQeCo9DzCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20the%20Polish%20town%20of%20Mlawa%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-01-26 |series=Sourcebook on contemporary controversies |year=2002 |publisher=IDEA |isbn=978-0-9702130-6-8 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Two days later some sixty Mława youths targeted and destroyed the house of a local Roma leader. The assailants quickly grew in number and began burning other Roma homes. Estimates put the number of participants in the violence from one hundred to two hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=EU Accession Monitoring Program|first=|title=Monitoring the EU accession process: minority protection : country reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=LVZATdD3JqSShAfnvpCSCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=8-IVAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=MLAWA+poland+romanies&amp;q=MLAWA+#search_anchor|accessdate=2011-01-27|series=Monitoring the EU accession process |volume=1|year=2001|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|isbn= 978-1-891385-19-3|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roma found protection at the local police station. Others hid at the homes of their Polish friends.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt; A total of 17 Roma houses were seriously damaged and further 4 houses and 9 apartments were vandalized, but no members of the Roma community were hurt. The crowd apparently targeted wealthier Roma and their estates. The police brought in additional forces and imposed a [[curfew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=1127|title=When the media make a difference: Comparing two European race crimes|last=Klimkiewicz|first=Beata|date=7 July 2004|publisher=[[European Roma Rights Centre]]|pages=''The pogrom in Mlawa, Poland: no media influence on justice''|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former political dissident [[Adam Michnik]] writing in ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' castigated the police and political authorities for their alleged inaction. The paper also demanded 'official action against ethnic hatred'. As a result, a number of political parties and academic institutions belatedly condemned the pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8E9u2aD4fYC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22was+the+only+paper+to+advocate+official+action+against+ethnic+hatred%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C-JATYW9MpK5hAfewfmZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22was%20the%20only%20paper%20to%20advocate%20official%20action%20against%20ethnic%20hatred%22&amp;f=false Cahn (2002) p.120]&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption of ethnic violence at Mława in 1991 has been described as 'the renewal of anti-Gypsy racism in Poland' by hostile foreign critics; presumably linked to a significant rise in Polish Roma [[Asylum seeker|asylum applications]] in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Acton|first=Thomas Alan|title=Gypsy politics and Traveller identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr3pF8qyS_AC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22In+1991+a+pogrom+at+Mlawa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CqFATeP6IIKyhAfk19ynBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%201991%20a%20pogrom%20at%20Mlawa%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-01-27|year=1997|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|isbn=978-0-900458-75-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drobizheva |first=L.

Afterwards, 21 persons were brought to court, and 17 were sentenced for up to 30 months in prison. The President of the Roma Society of Poland, Roman Kwiatkowski informed that the relations between the local Roma and their Polish neighbours twenty years after the fact are good.&lt;ref name="Napierski"/&gt;

A '''national trust''' is an organisation dedicated to preserving the [[cultural heritage]] of a particular geographic region. Although the focus of a national trust may vary by region, the principal role is to ensure the preservation of historically significant items, and to conserve areas of natural beauty. National trusts generally operate as private non-profit organizations. The first such trust organisation, [[The Trustees of Reservations]], originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of [[Massachusetts]], USA.&lt;ref name="INTOmovement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internationaltrusts.org/5366 | title=The National Trust Movement | publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | date=23 May 2014 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first national trust, the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]], was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a [[charitable organisation]] serving England, [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (it is commonly known in the UK as the National Trust). Other national trusts have since been set up around the world.&lt;ref name="INTOmovement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=colwell&gt;Max Colwell, David Colwell, ''Heritage Preserved with the National Trust of South Australia'' (1985), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=movement&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntlc.ca/?page_id=470 | title=The National Trust Movement | publisher=National Trust for Land &amp; Culture | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[International National Trusts Organisation]] (INTO) was established at a gathering in [[New Delhi]], India, with a mandate to support collaboration and [[best practices]] among national trusts and similar associations. It has member organisations from over 50 countries.&lt;ref name=movement /&gt;&lt;ref name=into-about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationaltrusts.org/about-into | title=About INTO| publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=into-members&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationaltrusts.org/into-members | title=INTO Members | publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14193">'''Oral history preservation''' is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of [[oral history]] materials, whatever format they may be in. Oral history is a method of historical documentation, using interviews with living survivors of the time being investigated. Oral history often touches on topics scarcely touched on by written documents, and by doing so, fills in the gaps of records that make up early historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Keakopa, M. (1998). The role of the archivist in the collection and preservation of oral traditions. S.A. Archives Journal, 40, 87-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting oral history ==

The earliest method of collecting oral history was through memory. (see: [[oral tradition]])
With the loss of elders who were willing to preserve and pass along these histories, cultural memories began to vanish.

With the advent of the written word, it became possible for cultures to preserve their history without the memory of a select few. Spoken word was transcribed, and the eyewitness accounts of those who lived through both significant and everyday events were able to be saved for future generations to study.

This method of historical preservation was augmented with the invention of different methods to record sound. Spoken word can now be recorded on audio or video tape, or through newer digital methods.

While new media allows for richer histories to be saved, it also comes with greater issues for preservationists, one such issue being that of copyright and the ethical concerns that come along with it. For all intents and purposes, copyright does not exist in oral testimonies, at least not as clearly as it does in written documents. It is hard to decide who holds the rights to the materials and how they should be handled.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, J. (2003). Preservation of oral sources: An analysis of the methods employed by the Sinomlando Project, University of Natal, for the preservation of oral sources. S.A. Archives Journal, 43, 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are ways to combat copyright and ethical concerns and restrictions, however. One such way is through a letter of intent. Users sign this document before listening to an oral history recording in order to demonstrate that they understand and have agreed to the usage restrictions put in place by the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Knoke, P.J., Schneider, W., &amp; Mudd, I. (1990). PROJECT JUKEBOX: technology for oral history preservation and access. Audiovisual Librarian, 7(2), 108-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medium ==

=== Past ways of saving oral histories ===

Early methods of recording sound included [[phonograph cylinder]]s (a stylus would draw wax grooves on the outside of a cylinder), [[gramophone record]]s (grooves on the flat side of a disk) and magnetic recordings.

=== Current way to save oral histories ===

While [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]]s are still used, [[video recording]]s have become standard. This allows the researcher to take body language and facial expressions (both important means of communication in themselves) into account. There is also an emerging trend to use the telephone to make [[Personal journal#Audio journals|audio journals]] when distance prevents face-to-face contact.

In order to ensure the preservation of oral histories it is important that all work is properly transcribed and stored on reliable media. It is important to preserve oral histories in modern digital format to ensure longevity and usability.  The simplest and easiest way to do this for audio histories is to purchase a "personal MP3 player" that has recording capabilities, and record directly to the flash chip in the player.  These are very inexpensive and can hold many hours of interviews.  The files should then be uploaded to a central computer server and copies can be burned to optical media, or copied to USB flash drives owned by the researchers, scholars and students working with the material.

{{Inappropriate person|date=May 2009}}

Recordable compact discs are commonly used over magnetic tape for the preservation of oral histories over a long period of time.  Compact Cassette tapes and Videotape were popular but have been almost completely replaced by optical media such as CD-R and DVD media.  CD-R is a successful technology that has proven its reliability over period of time, but it should be viewed with caution for long term storage as the media is easily scratched.  The safest way is to make a "gold master" CD that is not ever checked out for use from the library, and duplicate copies of this for use by people wishing to access it.  The Folk Heritage Collections, at the Library of Congress, set a standard for 24 bits when digitizing music. This creates "superb" sound and has a high level of detail (Danielson, 2001). The Library of Congress uses CD-R as one of its storage methods. The Library of Congress has a higher budget than many university or archives, therefore they are able to store materials in multiple places. But, the Library of Congress has stated that they do believe storing sound on CD-R is a safe storage method (Danielson, 2001). One can assume if it is considered safe by the Library of Congress it is a relatively safe method of preservation.

A huge challenge of oral history preservation today is the battle with digital obsolescence. There is an obvious link between oral history preservation and [[digital preservation]]. Oral histories are often recorded on an assortment of tapes which are ultimately transferred onto computerized, or digitized, formats in order to facilitate their longevity. These digitized formats then have to be preserved, along with their corresponding metadata, just as any other digital objects are. Technological advances are happening everyday and it is difficult to keep up with these changes.  [[Emulator|Emulation]] and [[Data migration|migration]] are two ways in which formats can be changed in order to be of use for longer. Emulation focuses on designing hardware and software that will imitate the old system so that it can accept the old files while migration focuses on fitting preserved data into a smaller number of formats that can still encode the complexities of the structure and form of the original format.&lt;ref&gt;Soete, G.J. (1997). Transforming libraries: Issues and innovations in preserving digital information. Washington, DC: Association of Research Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the recent cost decreases in hard disk drives, oral archivists are considering moving many of their popular holdings to permanent storage in a server farm.  For example, a single terabyte disk drive costing under $100 USD can hold 1,900 hours of uncompressed audio.  A CD-R by contrast can only hold 76 minutes of uncompressed audio.  Disk drive array cards such as the 3ware 9650SE can field 8TB of redundantly protected data in a standard PC case.  One of the big advantages of doing this is that as the servers age and are retired, the files can simply be copied to newer, larger replacement servers making hardware obsolescense a thing of the past.

== Basic preservation of the collection ==

===Oral history education===
Due to the growing importance of oral histories the United States, as well as the international community, have increased funding to produce more oral histories, preserve oral history collections, and train oral historians. There are a growing number of oral history programs and classes in college and university campus across America. Although Indiana University does not offer academic degrees in oral history The Center for the Study of History and Memory offers students the opportunity to take classes on the topic. Some of the major universities that offer classes or degrees in oral history are Columbia University, University of Kentucky, and University of California Los Angeles. Many international universities and organizations are also enhancing their programs. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, have all established oral history associations and offer educational classes on the subject. These programs are aimed at educating future oral historians on key issues relating to oral history, such as preservation. This is a highly debated subject matter, due to increasing technology and funding.

=== General ===
The basic preservation rule for oral histories is that the repository must make three copies each of the oral history, of the transcript, and of all accompanying paperwork (summaries and copyright statements).

* One copy will be the original item
* One copy will be the duplicating master
* One copy will be the access (public use) copy

=== Paper records ===
Transcripts of oral histories can facilitate their dissemination to the public. There are a few basic rules for paper (transcript) preservation of your oral history collection:

* Make sure transcriptions are created on [[acid-free paper]].
* Save original transcript, and make copies for public use. Do not loan out original.
* Store paper copies of transcriptions in archival-quality, acid free boxes.

=== Magnetic records ===
There are a few basic rules for [[magnetic recording]] preservation of your oral history collection:

* Save the original tape as well as the transcript of the interview
* Make an audio copy for public use, do not allow your original to be used
* Store your tapes away from magnetic fields
* Discourage users from fast forwarding and rewinding the audio tapes, this adds unnecessary wear and tear
* Remember that master copies must be played every once in a while to ensure they are still viable
* Keep your tapes in an environment that will maintain a temperature between {{convert|10|and|21|C|F}}. The environment must also maintain a humidity level between 40-50% relative humidity (RH).

=== Digital preservation ===
There are many different [[digital preservation]] strategies, but no one strategy has been agreed upon as appropriate for all data types or institutions.

== Oral history archives ==
Oral history materials are often stored in archival repositories that facilitate their preservation and longevity. Archival repositories are kept at the correct temperature to store oral history materials and trained professionals are there to ensure that the formats of the materials are kept up to date. Archivists, Preservationists and Conservators are in a unique position to appraise the shortcomings of existing archival records and to subsequently know what value can be made by oral history materials.&lt;ref&gt;Keakopa, M. (1998). The role of the archivist in the collection and preservation of oral traditions. S.A. Archives Journal,40,87-93.

'''Poporo''' is a device used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] cultures in present and [[pre-Columbian]] [[South America]] for storage of small amounts of [[lime (mineral)|lime]].  It consists of two pieces:  the receptacle, and the lid which includes a pin that is used to carry the lime to the mouth while chewing [[coca]] leaves.  Since the chewing of coca is sacred for the indigenous people, the poporos are also attributed with mystical powers and social status.

In Colombia, poporos are found in archeological remains from the [[Chibcha]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]] cultures among others. The materials used in the early periods are mainly [[pottery]] and carved stone.  In classic periods [[gold]] and [[tumbaga]] are the most frequent: an example of this is the [[Poporo Quimbaya]] exhibited in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] which is a national symbol.  At the present time, the indigenous people of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] still use poporos made with the dried fruits of a plant of genus [[cucurbita]] (totumo), in the traditional way.

==Poporo Quimbaya==
One particularly famous poporo, the Poporo Quimbaya, is a [[pre-Colombian]] artpiece of the classic [[Quimbaya civilization|quimbaya]] period, currently exhibited in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Its primary use was as a ceremonial device for chewing of [[coca]] leaves during religious ceremonies.  It was made around 300 CE with a [[lost-wax casting]] process.

It is believed that the artpiece was stolen from a [[burial chamber]] in the early 1930s, on Loma del Pajarito ("Birdie Hill") near [[Yarumal]] in the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department, where, at the time, the [[grave robbing]] of indigenous  tombs was very common, often ending with destruction of important archeological pieces in order to extract the gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/esp/o_quim_O0001509.htm "Quimbaya Poporo."] ''Museo del Oro.'' Retrieved 15 Jan 2011. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 the Banco de la República (Colombian Central Bank and owner/operator of the Gold Museum in Bogotá), purchased the poporo, in an effort to preserve it from destruction. This began a larger project of preservation of pre-Colombian [[Goldsmith|goldwork]] that allowed the creation of [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]].

The Poporo Quimbaya is an unusual piece, made of [[tumbaga]], with oddly [[minimalism|minimalistic]] lines, that give it a modern look.   It is one of the most recognized pre-Colombian artpieces, being often used as a symbol of the indigenous pre-Colombian culture.  It has been depicted in the Colombian currency, in coins and bills.

The '''Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg''' ({{lang-de|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg}}) or '''SPSG''', was founded by a treaty of 23 August 1994 between the German federal states of [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] as a public [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] following [[German reunification]]. The treaty came into force on 1 January 1995.
The foundation is separate from the considerably larger [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] (''Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz'').

== History ==

The SPSG is an amalgamation of the Potsdam-Sanssouci State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten Potsdam-Sanssouci'') in the former [[East Germany]] and the State Palaces and Gardens Administration (''Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten'') in [[West Berlin]] that had been formed following the [[division of Germany]]. These institutions were formed from the Prussian State Palaces and Gardens Administration that had been founded on 1 April 1927 as a result of the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the [[Prussia]]n state and which was disbanded in 1945.

The SPSG has its headquarters in Brandenburg's capital city, [[Potsdam]]. Its owners are the states of Berlin (21.35%) and Brandenburg (36.60%) and the federal government (42.05%) (as at: 2007). The foundation receives other support from numerous societies and private sponsors.

The Berlin-Brandenburg Foundation For Prussian Palaces and Gardens was listed in 2001 in the "Blue Book" that publishes a list of heritage sites in eastern Germany that are of national significance and currently includes 20 so-called "cultural beacons" (''kulturelle Leuchttürme''). The selection of heritage sites was based on an initiative of the commissaries of the Federal Office of Heritage and the Media and voted on by the East German ministers of culture.

== Properties of SPSG ==
The Foundation manages and administers approximately 500 employees in Potsdam, Brandenburg and Berlin, about 300 buildings or structures, including more than 150 historic buildings and nearly 800 acres of gardens, with Potsdam-Berlin's cultural landscape forming the largest part. With the treaty of SPSG coming into force, these land and buildings are included in the inventory:

=== In Brandenburg ===

&lt;!--

== Goals ==
In über dreihundertjähriger Bautätigkeit entstanden durch die brandenburg-preußischen Herrscher Schlösser und Gartenanlagen von internationaler Anerkennung. 1990 wurden die Schlösser und Gärten in Potsdam, die auf Berliner Gebiet liegende Pfaueninsel sowie Schloss und Park Glienicke als Weltkulturerbe unter den Schutz der [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] gestellt.

Um die kulturhistorisch bedeutenden Anlagen und Gebäude zu erhalten, ist die SPSG nach dem Gesetz zum Staatsvertrag, Artikel 2 (1), verpflichtet:
:''„…, die ihr übergebenen Kulturgüter zu bewahren, unter Berücksichtigung historischer, kunst- und gartenhistorischer und denkmalpflegerischer Belange zu pflegen, ihr Inventar zu ergänzen, der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen und die Auswertung dieses Kulturbesitzes für die Interessen der Allgemeinheit insbesondere in Wissenschaft und Bildung zu ermöglichen.“''

Neben der denkmalpflegerischen Aufgabe und der Öffnung der Schlossanlagen für Besichtigungen werden jährlich Sonderveranstaltungen und Sonderausstellungen, vor allem zu Themen der preußischen Kulturgeschichte, durchgeführt. Konzerte, wie die „Schlössernacht“ in Potsdam-Sanssouci oder das „Kammeroperfestival“ in Rheinsberg, gehören seit Jahren zu den feststehenden, gut besuchten Veranstaltungen in den Schlossanlagen.

== Die Vermögensauseinandersetzung ==

Nach dem [[Erster Weltkrieg|Ersten Weltkrieg]] und dem Ende der Monarchie wurde im November 1918 das Vermögen, der Grundbesitz und die Immobilien des Hauses Hohenzollern von der neuen Regierung beschlagnahmt. Nach achtjähriger Verhandlung zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und dem preußischen Staat mit dem Ziel eines [[Vergleich (Recht)|Vergleichs]] wurde am 26. Oktober 1926 ein „Gesetz über die Vermögensauseinandersetzung zwischen dem Preußischen Staat und den Mitgliedern des vormals regierenden Preußischen Königshauses“ verabschiedet.

Dem voraus ging ein von [[Sozialdemokratie|sozialdemokratischen]] und [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands|kommunistischen]] Parteien angestrebter [[Volksentscheid]] mit dem Ziel der entschädigungslosen [[Enteignung]] aller zweiundzwanzig Fürstenhäuser des [[Deutsches Reich|Deutschen Reichs]]. Die am 20. Juni 1926 durchgeführte Abstimmung, die erste in der [[Weimarer Republik]], brachte 14,5 Millionen Wahlstimmen, die einem „Gesetz zur Enteignung des Fürstenvermögens“ zusagten. Eine für die Durchführung erforderliche Stimmenzahl von mindestens 20 Millionen wurde jedoch nicht erreicht. (''siehe'': [[Fürstenenteignung]])

In Folge weiterer Zugeständnisse von Seiten des Hauses Hohenzollern konnte im Oktober 1926 ein Vertrag zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und der preußischen Regierung ratifiziert werden. Der als Eigentum verbliebene Immobilien- und Grundbesitz, der hauptsächlich im Osten des ehemaligen Deutschen Reichs lag, ging jedoch durch Zerstörung und Enteignung während und nach dem [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieg]] verloren. Nur ein Bruchteil des durch den Vertrag zugesprochenen Besitzes blieb erhalten. Heute ist nur noch die [[Burg Hohenzollern]] bei [[Hechingen]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) Eigentum des Hauses Hohenzollern.

Zur Verwaltung und Instandhaltung der in Staatsbesitz gekommenen Gebäude und Gartenanlagen wurde am 1. April 1927 die preußische „Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten“ gegründet, die die Schlossanlagen als Museen der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machten. Auch hier gab es durch Kriegseinwirkung, Gebietsverlust und Beutenahme von Kulturgut durch die [[Rote Armee|Sowjetarmee]] erhebliche Verluste. Obwohl 1955 und 1957/58 Kunstschätze aus der [[Sowjetunion]] nach Deutschland zurückkamen, fehlen in den Schlössern der SPSG bis heute mehr als 3.000 Ölgemälde, circa 1.000 Skulpturen, Tausende von Porzellanen, Möbel, 80.000 Bände aus den königlichen Bibliotheken und mehrere tausend Grafiken.

== Bildrechte ==

Im Jahre 2010 gewann die Stiftung einen Rechtsstreit um die Verwertung von Fotografien ihrer Liegenschaften vor dem Bundesgerichtshof.&lt;ref&gt;V ZR 44/10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rijeka Crnojevića''' ([[Cyrillic alphabet|Montenegrin Cyrillic]]: Ријека Црнојевића), meaning the river of [[House of Crnojević|Crnojević]], is a town in [[Montenegro]] besides the eponymous river, near the coast of [[Skadar lake]].

==History==

'''Robert Hooke''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|h|ʊ|k}}; {{OldStyleDate|28 July|1635|18 July}}&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1703) was an English [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], architect and [[polymath]].

His adult life comprised three distinct periods: as a scientific inquirer lacking money; achieving great wealth and standing through his reputation for hard work and scrupulous honesty following the [[Great Fire of London|great fire of 1666]], and eventually becoming ill and party to jealous intellectual disputes (the last may have contributed to his relative historical obscurity).

At one time he was simultaneously the curator of experiments of the [[Royal Society]], a member of its council, [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]], and Surveyor to the City of London after the [[Great Fire of London]] (in which capacity he appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire). He was also an important architect of his time – though few of his buildings now survive and some of those are generally misattributed – and was instrumental in devising a set of planning controls for London whose influence remains today. [[Allan Chapman (historian)|Allan Chapman]] has characterised him as "England's [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chapman, Alan|url=http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm |title=England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain|volume= 67|pages= 239–275 |year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306084446/http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm|archivedate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke studied at [[Wadham College, Oxford]] during the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] where he became one of a tightly knit group of ardent [[Royalist]]s led by [[John Wilkins]].  Here he was employed as an assistant to [[Thomas Willis]] and to [[Robert Boyle]], for whom he built the vacuum pumps used in Boyle's [[gas law]] experiments.  He built some of the earliest [[Gregorian telescope]]s and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. In 1665 he inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration with his book, ''[[Micrographia]]''. Based on his microscopic observations of fossils, Hooke was an early proponent of biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Drake, Ellen Tan | chapter = Hooke's Ideas of the Terraqueous Globe and a Theory of Evolution | editor = Michael Cooper | editor2 = Michael Hunter | title = Robert Hooke: Tercentennial Studies | publisher = Ashgate | year = 2006 | location = Burlington, Vermont | pages = 135–149 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5365-3 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=P0-XfTTcwwQC&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Restless Genius: Robert Hooke and His Earthly Thoughts | year = 1996 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-506695-1 | author = Drake, Ellen Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He investigated the phenomenon of [[refraction]], deducing the [[wave theory of light]], and was the first to suggest that matter expands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by relatively large distances.  He performed pioneering work in the field of surveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first modern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected in favour of rebuilding along the existing routes.  He also came near to an experimental proof that [[gravity]] follows an [[inverse square law]], and hypothesised that such a relation governs the motions of the planets, an idea which was independently developed by [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 15th Edition, vol.6 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Hooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments of the [[Royal Society]], a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of Robert Boyle.

==Life and works==
[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|upright|thumb|Hooke's [[microscope]], from an engraving in ''Micrographia''.]]

Much of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. Richard Waller mentions it in his introduction to ''The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.'', printed in 1705. In the chapter ''Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits'', Hooke argues that [[John Dee]] made use of [[Johannes Trithemius|Trithemian]] [[steganography]], to conceal his communication with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6xVTAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke|page=203|author=Robert Hooke|year=1705|publisher=Richard Waller, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Waller, along with [[John Ward (academic)|John Ward]]'s ''Lives of the Gresham Professors'' (with a list of his major works)&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

===Early life===
[[File:Memorial portrait of Robert Hooke at Alum Bay, IoW for Carisbrooke Museum.JPG|thumb|Memorial portrait of Robert Hooke at [[Alum Bay]], [[Isle of Wight]], his birthplace, by Rita Greer (2012).]]
Robert Hooke was born in 1635 in [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert was the last of four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of [[All Saints' Church, Freshwater|Freshwater's Church of All Saints]],&lt;ref name=Jardine23&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jardine | first = Lisa | title = The Curious Life of Robert Hooke: The Man who Measured London | publisher = Harper Collins Publishers | year = 2003 | location = New York | page = 23 | isbn = 978-0-00-714944-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. John Hooke also was in charge of a local school, and so was able to teach Robert, at least partly at home perhaps due to the boy's frail health. He was a Royalist and almost certainly a member of a group who went to pay their respects to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] when he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Robert, too, grew up to be a staunch monarchist.

As a youth, Robert Hooke was fascinated by observation, mechanical works, and drawing, interests that he would pursue in various ways throughout his life. He dismantled a brass clock and built a wooden replica that, by all accounts, worked "well enough", and he learned to draw, making his own materials from coal, chalk and ruddle ([[iron ore]]).

On his father's death in 1648, Robert was left a sum of forty pounds&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|title=The Tragedy of Robert Hooke's Brother|last=Martin|first=Rob|year=2000|accessdate=9 March 2010|quote=Robert is given forty pounds, a chest and all the books|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418154423/http://freespace.virgin.net/ric.martin/vectis/hookeweb/sggg.htm|archivedate=18 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|title=Hooke biography|author1=O'Connor, J J|author2=Robertson, E F|lastauthoramp=yes|date=August 2002|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=9 March 2010|quote=He was left £40 by his father, together with all his father's books (the often quoted figure of £100 is a much repeated error)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716214513/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hooke.html|archivedate=16 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that enabled him to buy an apprenticeship; with his poor health throughout his life but evident mechanical facility his father had it in mind that he might become a [[watchmaker]] or [[limner]] (a decorator of [[illuminated manuscript]]s), though Hooke was also interested in painting. Hooke was an apt student, so although he went to London to take up an apprenticeship, and studied briefly with [[Samuel Cowper]] and [[Peter Lely]], he was soon able to enter [[Westminster School]] in London, under Dr. [[Richard Busby]]. Hooke quickly mastered Latin and Greek,&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"/&gt; made some study of Hebrew, and mastered [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].&lt;ref name="JOCEFR"/&gt; Here, too, he embarked on his lifelong study of [[mechanics]].

It appears that Hooke was one of a group of students whom Busby educated in parallel to the main work of the school.  Contemporary accounts say he was "not much seen" in the school, and this appears to be true of others in a similar position.  Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the Protectorate.  To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work, those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers to explain it to those who were less able.  This was exemplified in the person of [[George Hooper]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], whom Busby described as "the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School".

===Oxford===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
In 1653, Hooke (who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the [[pipe organ|organ]]) secured a chorister's place at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt; He was employed as a "chemical assistant" to Dr [[Thomas Willis]], for whom Hooke developed a great admiration.  There he met the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and gained employment as his assistant from about 1655 to 1662, constructing, operating, and demonstrating Boyle's "machina Boyleana" or air pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Shapin, Steven |author2=Schaffer, Simon | title = Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle and the Experimental Life | location = Princeton | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1985 | chapter-url = http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/ShapinSchaffer/ShapinSchaffer_Seeing.html | chapter = 2 | isbn = 978-0-691-08393-3 | accessdate = 11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1662 or 1663 that was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/robert-hooke/#gsc.tab=0 Robert Hooke]'' {{ISBN|978-0-756-53317-5}} p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 Hooke described some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight to Wilkins, but concluded that human muscles were insufficient to the task.

Hooke himself characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science, and the friends he made there were of paramount importance to him throughout his career, particularly [[Christopher Wren]].  Wadham was then under the guidance of [[John Wilkins]], who had a profound impact on Hooke and those around him.  Wilkins was also a Royalist, and acutely conscious of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times.  There was a sense of urgency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the Protectorate.  Wilkins' "philosophical meetings" in his study were clearly important, though few records survive except for the experiments Boyle conducted in 1658 and published in 1660.  This group went on to form the nucleus of the [[Royal Society]].  Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle's experiments based on the pump of [[Ralph Greatorex]], which was considered, in Hooke's words, "too gross to perform any great matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Fulton, John F. | title = The Honourable Robert Boyle, F.R.S. (1627–1692) | journal = Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London | year = 1960 | volume = 15| pages = 119–135 (123) | doi = 10.1098/rsnr.1960.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Hooke had a particularly keen eye, and was an adept mathematician, neither of which applied to Boyle.  It has been suggested that Hooke probably made the observations and may well have developed the mathematics of [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Gunther, Robert | title = Early Science in Oxford | volume = 7 | publisher = privately printed | date= 1923–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, it is clear that Hooke was a valued assistant to Boyle and the two retained a mutual high regard.

A chance surviving copy of Willis' pioneering ''De anima brutorum'', a gift from the author, was chosen by Hooke from Wilkins' library on his death as a memento at [[John Tillotson]]'s invitation.  This book is now in the [[Wellcome Library]].  The book and its inscription in Hooke's hand are a testament to the lasting influence of Wilkins and his circle on the young Hooke.

===Royal Society===
The [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660, and in April 1661 the society debated a short tract on the rising of water in slender glass pipes, in which Hooke reported that the height water rose was related to the bore of the pipe (due to what is now termed [[capillary action]]).  His explanation of this phenomenon was subsequently published in ''Micrography Observ.'' issue 6, in which he also explored the nature of "the fluidity of gravity". On 5 November 1661, Sir [[Robert Moray]] proposed that a Curator be appointed to furnish the society with Experiments, and this was unanimously passed with Hooke being named.  His appointment was made on 12 November, with thanks recorded to Dr. Boyle for releasing him to the Society's employment.

In 1664, Sir John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of fifty pounds on the Society for the founding of a ''Mechanick Lecture'', and the Fellows appointed Hooke to this task.  On 27 June 1664 he was confirmed to the office, and on 11 January 1665 was named ''Curator by Office'' for life with an additional salary of £30 to Cutler's annuity.{{efn|Sir John Cutler and Hooke were at odds in the following years over monies due to Hooke. Following Cutler's death, Hooke enlisted the aid of friends of the Cutler family, including Master of [[The Haberdashers Company]] Sir [[Richard Levett]], for whom Hooke was involved in a building commission, to help recover the funds owed by Cutler.&lt;ref name=Jardine23 /&gt;}}

Hooke's role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members.  Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air, the implosion of glass bubbles which had been sealed with comprehensive hot air, and demonstrating that the ''Pabulum vitae'' and ''flammae'' were one and the same. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs, and noting the difference between [[venous]] and [[arterial]] blood.  There were also experiments on the subject of gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies and measuring of [[barometric pressure]] at different heights, and [[pendulum]]s up to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.

Instruments were devised to measure a [[second of arc]] in the movement of the sun or other stars, to measure the strength of [[gunpowder]], and in particular an engine to cut teeth for watches, much finer than could be managed by hand, an invention which was, by Hooke's death, in constant use.&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;{{Cite book|last = Waller | first = Richard | title = The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.|publisher=Sam. Smith and Benj. Walford|year=1705|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1663 and 1664, Hooke produced his microscopy observations, subsequently collated in ''[[Micrographia]]'' in 1665.

On 20 March 1664, Hooke succeeded Arthur Dacres as [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]].  Hooke received the degree of "Doctor of Physic" in December 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = De Milt, Clara | title = Robert Hooke, Chemist | journal = Journal of Chemical Education |date=November 1939 | volume = 16 | pages = 503–510| doi = 10.1021/ed016p503|bibcode = 1939JChEd..16..503D| issue = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooke and Newcomen===
There is a widely reported story that Dr Hooke corresponded with [[Thomas Newcomen]] in connection with Newcomen's invention of the steam engine. This story was discussed by Rhys Jenkins, a past President of the Newcomen Society, in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;“The Heat Engine Idea in the Seventeenth Century” Rhys Jenkins, Paper read to the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, 21 October 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins traced the origin of the story to an article "Steam Engines" by Dr. [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] (1739–1805) in the third edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica”, which says ''There are to be found among Hooke's papers, in the possession of the Royal Society, some notes of observations, for the use of Newcomen, his countryman, on [[Denis Papin|Papin]]'s boasted method of transmitting to a great distance the action of an mill by means of pipes'', and that Hooke had dissuaded Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle. Jenkins points out a number of errors in Robison's article, and questions whether the correspondent might in fact have been Newton, whom Hooke is known to have corresponded with, the name being misread as Newcomen. A search by Mr. H W Dickinson of Hooke's papers held by the Royal Society, which had been bound together in the middle of the 18th century, i.e. before Robison's time, and carefully preserved since, revealed no trace of any correspondence between Hooke and Newcomen. Jenkins concluded ''... this story must be omitted from the history of the steam engine, at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming.''

In the intervening years since 1936 no such evidence has been found, but the story persists. For instance, in a book published in 2011 it is said that ''in a letter dated 1703 Hooke did suggest that Newcomen use condensing steam to drive the piston.''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and disputes==
Hooke was irascible, at least in later life, proud, and prone to take umbrage with intellectual competitors, though he was by all accounts also a staunch friend and ally and was loyal always to the circle of ardent [[Royalist]]s with whom he had his early training at [[Wadham College]], particularly [[Christopher Wren]].  His reputation suffered after his death and this is popularly attributed to a dispute with [[Isaac Newton]] over credit for his work on gravitation, the planets and to a lesser degree light. His dispute with [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] about whether Oldenburg had leaked or passed on details of Hooke's watch escapement to others is another well-known example.

Newton, as President of the Royal Society, did much to obscure Hooke, including, it is said, destroying (or failing to preserve) the only known portrait of the man.  It did not help that the first biography of Wren, ''Parentalia'', was written by Wren's son, and tended to exaggerate Wren's work over all others.  Hooke's reputation was revived during the twentieth century through studies of [[Robert Gunther]] and Margaret 'Espinasse. After a long period of relative obscurity he has now been recognised as one of the most important scientists of his age.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the 2003 Hooke meeting at the University of Oxford: {{cite web| title = Robert Hooke Day at Christ Church, Oxford | url = http://hooke.chem.ox.ac.uk/ | accessdate = 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke was apt to use [[ciphers]] and guard his ideas.  As curator of Experiments to the Royal Society he was responsible for demonstrating many ideas sent in to the Society, and there is evidence that he would subsequently assume some credit for these ideas. Hooke also was immensely busy and thus unable&amp;nbsp;– or in some cases unwilling, pending a way of profiting from the enterprise via letters patent&amp;nbsp;– to develop all of his own ideas. This was a time of immense scientific progress, and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously.

None of this should distract from Hooke's inventiveness, his remarkable experimental facility, and his capacity for hard work. His ideas about gravitation, and his claim of priority for the inverse square law, are outlined below.  He was granted a large number of patents for inventions and refinements in the fields of elasticity, optics, and barometry. The Royal Society's Hooke papers (recently discovered after disappearing when Newton took over) will open up a modern reassessment.

Much has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke's personality, starting with comments by his first biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was "in person, but despicable" and "melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous."&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles.  For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke "claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Berry | first = Arthur | title = A Short History of Astronomy | publisher = John Murray | location = London | year = 1898 | page = 221}}- See also the reprint published by Dover in 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan wrote that Hooke was "positively unscrupulous" and possessing an "uneasy apprehensive vanity" in dealings with Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sullivan | first = J. W. N. | title = Isaac Newton 1642–1727 | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York  | year = 1938 | pages = 35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel used the phrase "cantankerous, envious, vengeful" in his description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Manuel | first = Frank E. | title = A Portrait of Isaac Newton | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1968 | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; More described Hooke having both a "cynical temperament" and a "caustic tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Isaac Newton  | publisher = Charles Schribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 1934 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives "difficult", "suspicious", and "irritable" in describing Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrarde | first = E.

She writes that "the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a morose and envious recluse is completely false."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke interacted with noted craftsmen such as [[Thomas Tompion]], the clockmaker, and Christopher Cocks (Cox), an instrument maker.  Hooke often met [[Christopher Wren]], with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with [[John Aubrey]].  Hooke's diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, and to dinners with Robert Boyle.  He took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant, Harry Hunt.  Within his family, Hooke took both a niece and a cousin into his home, teaching them mathematics.

Robert Hooke spent his life largely on the Isle of Wight, at Oxford, and in London.  He never married, but his diary records that he had sexual relations with his niece, Grace, and several of his housekeepers. He at one point records that one of these housekeepers gave birth to a girl, but doesn't note the paternity of the child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On 3 March 1703, Hooke died in London, and a chest containing £8,000 in money and gold was found in his room at Gresham College. Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society which would have given his name to a library, laboratory and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to an illiterate cousin, Elizabeth Stephens.{{sfn|Inwood|2002|pp=1,2}}  He was buried at [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], but the precise location of his grave is unknown.

===Mechanics===
In 1660, Hooke discovered [[Hooke's law|the law]] of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] with extension in an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] spring.  He first described this discovery in the anagram "ceiiinosssttuv", whose solution he published in 1678&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''De Potentia Restitutiva, or of Spring. Explaining the Power of Springing Bodies'', London, 1678.&lt;/ref&gt; as "Ut tensio, sic vis" meaning "As the extension, so the force."  Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the [[balance spring]] or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiece&amp;nbsp;– a watch&amp;nbsp;– to keep time with reasonable accuracy.  A bitter dispute between Hooke and [[Christiaan Huygens]] on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see ''External links'' below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718125416/http://webapps.qmul.ac.uk/cell/Hooke/hooke_folio.php?id=80&amp;option=both |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Hooke Folio Online |publisher=Webapps.qmul.ac.uk |accessdate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting{{to whom|date=July 2018}} from a twentieth-century vantage point that Hooke first announced his law of elasticity as an [[anagram]].  This was a method sometimes used by scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, [[Galileo]], and others, to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Hooke became Curator of Experiments in 1662 to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings.  This was a position he held for over 40 years.  While this position kept him in the thick of science in Britain and beyond, it also led to some heated arguments with other scientists, such as Huygens (see above) and particularly with [[Isaac Newton]] and the Royal Society's [[Henry Oldenburg]].  In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of [[Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]] in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = 'Espinasse | first = Margaret | title = Robert Hooke | publisher = William Heinemann Ltd. | year = 1956 | location = London | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the [[Cymatics|nodal patterns]] associated with the [[normal mode|modes of vibration]] of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514140121/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html |date=14 May 2011 }}, [http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html Institute for Learning Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135833/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/about/index.html |date=11 November 2007 }}, [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Scientists'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 101, {{ISBN|7810802259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In acoustics, in 1681 he showed the Royal Society that musical tones could be generated from spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Robert Hooke|author=Clive Greated|access-date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitation===
While many of his contemporaries believed in the [[aether theories|aether]] as a medium for transmitting attraction or repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665). Hooke's 1666 [[Royal Society]] lecture on gravity added two further principles: that all bodies move in straight lines till deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dugald Stewart]] quoted Hooke's own words on his system of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Dugald (1877) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OAwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind''], T. &amp; T. Clark, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, Section 4.2 (pp. 304 ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"I will explain," says Hooke, in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, "a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, an ellipse, or some other curve. 3. That this attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer. As to the proportion in which those forces diminish by an increase of distance, I own I have not discovered it...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to "all celestial bodies" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines.

Hooke published his ideas about the "System of the World" again in somewhat developed form in 1674, as an addition to "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations".&lt;ref name=attempt&gt;Hooke's 1674 statement in "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations", is available in [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView/ECHOzogiLib?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/XXTBUC3U/pageimg online facsimile here].&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body.

Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions.  Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e. "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with Newton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iliffe, Rob |title=Newton:A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8KyKP1T-sYC&amp;pg=PT140|year= 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157902-8|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which the full text is now published).&lt;ref name=167986letters&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679/80) at pp. 297–314, and the 1686 correspondence over Hooke's priority claim at pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke's ostensible purpose was to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H W (ed.) (1960), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Vol. 2 (1676–1687), Cambridge University Press, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items.   Newton's reply offered "a fansy of my own" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.{{efn|Several commentators{{who|date=November 2018}} have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping "a heavy body suspended in the Air" (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at p. 301, 'Correspondence' vol. 2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter "supposing no resistance", see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at p. 259; and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote "where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in which it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C". Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pp. 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also online: see Wilson, p. 241, showing Newton's 1679 diagram with spiral,&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN:0521542057, 9780521542050, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 page 241]&lt;/ref&gt; and extract of his letter; also Wilson, p. 242 showing Hooke's 1679 diagram including two paths, closed curve and spiral.&lt;ref&gt;R. Taton, C. Wilson, Michael Hoskin (eds), ''Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton'',Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN:0521542057, 9780521542050, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 page 242]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral "is true in a resisting medium such as our air is", see 'Correspondence', vol. 2 cited above, at p. 433, document #286.}} A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1679|80 to Newton, communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;See p. 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol. 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686, when the first book of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed that he had given Newton the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center".  At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1660s," the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Gal, Ofer (2002) ''Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'', Springer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9 p. 9], {{ISBN|1402007329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiteside, D T |title=The pre-history of the 'Principia' from 1664 to 1686|jstor=531520|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1991.0002 |journal= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 45|year=1991|pages =11–61 (13–20)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid "at great distances from the center".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the 'Principia', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system.  Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it."&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

One of the contrasts between the two men was that Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications as well as optical experimentation, while Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range, that it is not surprising to find that he left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped.  This in turn makes it understandable how in 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; "The example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), p. 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", [and] "L'exemple de Hook" [serves] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horology===
Hooke made tremendously important contributions to the science of timekeeping, being intimately involved in the advances of his time; the introduction of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.

====Anchor escapement====
[[File:Anchor Escapement.png|thumb|upright|[[Anchor escapement]]]]

In 1655, according to his autobiographical notes, Hooke began to acquaint himself with astronomy, through the good offices of John Ward.  Hooke applied himself to the improvement of the [[pendulum]] and in 1657 or 1658, he began to improve on pendulum mechanisms, studying the work of [[Giovanni Riccioli]], and going on to study both gravitation and the mechanics of timekeeping.

Henry Sully, writing in Paris in 1717, described the [[anchor escapement]] as ''an admirable invention of which Dr. Hooke, formerly professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, was the inventor.''&lt;ref&gt;Sully, H and Le Roy, J (1737) ''Regle artificielle des tems'', G. Dupuis, Paris, ch. 1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Derham]] also attributes it to Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, William (1734) ''The artificial clock maker'', James, John and Paul Knapton. at the Crown, in Ludgate Street., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Watch balance spring====
[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|right|thumb|upright|[[Christiaan Huygens]]]]

Hooke recorded that he conceived of a way to determine [[longitude]] (then a critical problem for navigation), and with the help of Boyle and others he attempted to patent it.  In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with a [[coil spring]] attached to the arbour of the balance.  Hooke's ultimate failure to secure sufficiently lucrative terms for the exploitation of this idea resulted in its being shelved, and evidently caused him to become more jealous of his inventions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Hooke developed the [[balance spring]] independently of and at least 5 years before [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/09/science.research "Eureka! Lost manuscript found in cupboard"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who published his own work in ''Journal de Scavans'' in February 1675.

===Microscopy===
[[File:Hooke Microscope-03000276-FIG-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Hooke's microscope]]
In 1665 Hooke published ''[[Micrographia]]'', a book describing observations made with [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s, as well as some original work in [[biology]].  Hooke coined the term ''[[cell (biology)|cell]]'' for describing biological organisms, the term being suggested by the resemblance of plant cells to cells of a honeycomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooke|first1=Robert|title=Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon|date=1665|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486495644|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Micrographia+honeycomb#v=onepage&amp;q=Micrographia%20honeycomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hand-crafted, leather and gold-tooled microscope he used to make the observations for ''Micrographia'', originally constructed by Christopher White in London, is on display at the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] in [[Washington, DC]].

''Micrographia'' also contains Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle and Hooke's, ideas on combustion.  Hooke's experiments led him to conclude that combustion involves a substance that is mixed with air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree, but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century.  Hooke went on to conclude that respiration also involves a specific component of the air.&lt;ref&gt;See particularly Observation 16 of ''Micrographia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Partington even goes so far as to claim that if "Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion it is probable that he would have discovered [[oxygen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Partington, J.

===Palaeontology===
[[File:Moon Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|upright|Drawings of the [[Moon]] and the [[Pleiades]] from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'']]
One of the observations in ''Micrographia'' was of [[petrified wood|fossil wood]], the microscopic structure of which he compared to ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells, such as [[Ammonites]], were the remains of living things that had been soaked in petrifying water laden with minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudwick|first=Martin J.S.|authorlink=Martin J. S. Rudwick|title=The Meaning of Fossils|year=1976|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke believed that such fossils provided reliable clues to the past history of life on earth, and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like [[John Ray]] who found the concept of [[extinction]] theologically unacceptable, that in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J.

His treatise... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature. 'However trivial a thing,' he says, 'a rotten shell may appear to some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually practised,' &amp;c.; 'and though it must be granted that it is very difficult to read them and to raise a chronology out of them, and to state the intervals of the time wherein such or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not impossible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Hooke noted the shadows (a and b) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of [[Saturn]].]]

One of the more-challenging problems tackled by Hooke was the measurement of the distance to a star (other than the Sun).  The star chosen was [[Gamma Draconis]] and the method to be used was [[parallax]] determination.  After several months of observing, in 1669, Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved.  It is now known that Hooke's equipment was far too imprecise to allow the measurement to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hirshfeld, Alan W. | title = Parallax, The Race to Measure the Cosmos|isbn=978-0716737117 | year = 2001| publisher = W. H. Freeman | location = New York | pages = 144–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma Draconis was the same star [[James Bradley]] used in 1725 in discovering the [[aberration of light]].

Hooke's activities in astronomy extended beyond the study of stellar distance.  His ''Micrographia'' contains illustrations of the [[Pleiades]] star cluster as well as of [[lunar craters]].  He performed experiments to study how such craters might have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Ashbrook, Joseph |isbn=978-0521106047| title = The Astronomical Scrapbook | year = 1984 | place = Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher = Sky Publishing Corporation | pages = 240–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke also was an early observer of the [[rings of Saturn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Alexander, A. F. O'D. | title = The Planet Saturn | year = 1962 | place = Londin | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited | pages = 108–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered one of the first observed [[double-star]] systems, [[Gamma Arietis]], in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Aitken, Robert G. | title = The Binary Stars | year = 1935 | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
A lesser-known contribution, however one of the first of its kind, was Hooke's scientific model of human [[memory]].  Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a mechanistic model of human memory, which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Singer, B. R. |year=1979|title=Robert Hooke on memory: Association and time perception (I)|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 31|pages= 115–131|jstor=531553|pmid=11609928|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1976.0003|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting&amp;nbsp;–  some with surprising modern accuracy.&lt;ref name="Hintzman, D. L. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hintzman, D. L. |year=2003|title=Robert Hooke's model of memory|journal= Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|pmid=12747488|volume= 10|pages= 3–14|doi=10.3758/BF03196465|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work, overlooked for nearly 200 years, shared a variety of similarities with [[Richard Semon]]'s work of 1919/1923, both assuming memories were physical and located in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Semon, R. (1923). Mnemic psychology (B. Duffy, Trans.). London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. (Original work published 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L. (2001). ''Forgotten ideas, neglected pioneers: Richard Semon and the story of memory''. Philadelphia: Psychology Press/Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|184169052X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schacter, D. L.|author2=Eich, J. E.|author3=Tulving, E.|last-author-amp=yes |year=1978|title= Richard Semon's theory of memory|journal= Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior|volume=17|pages= 721–743|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(78)90443-7|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model's more interesting points are that it (1) allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; (2) it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; (3) it explains memory for recency; (4) it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming, and (5) the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model's assumption in a straightforward way.&lt;ref name="Hintzman, D. L. 2003"/&gt; This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light.  It has been speculated that this work saw little review as the printing was done in small batches in a post-Newtonian age of science and was most likely deemed out of date by the time it was published.  Further interfering with its success was contemporary memory psychologists' rejection of immaterial souls, which Hooke invoked to some degree in regards to the processes of attention, encoding and retrieval.

==Architecture==
[[File:MK WillenChurch01.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|Church of St Mary Magdalene]] at Willen, [[Milton Keynes]]]]
[[File:Jan Baptist van Helmont portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait thought for a time to be Hooke, but almost certainly [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].]]

Hooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to [[Christopher Wren]], in which capacity he helped Wren rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] in 1666, and also worked on the design of London's [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|Monument to the fire]], the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House in Bloomsbury]], and the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (which became known as 'Bedlam').  Other buildings designed by Hooke include The [[Royal College of Physicians]] (1679), [[Ragley Hall]] in Warwickshire, [[Ramsbury Manor]] in Wiltshire&lt;ref&gt;Inwood, Stephen (28 February 2011). The Man Who Knew Too Much (Kindle Location 8290). Macmillan Publishers UK. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and the parish church of [[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Willen|St Mary Magdalene]] at [[Willen]] in Milton Keynes, [[History of Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]].  Hooke's collaboration with [[Christopher Wren]] also included [[St Paul's Cathedral]], whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke. Hooke also participated in the design of the [[Pepys Library]], which held the manuscripts of [[Samuel Pepys]]' diaries, the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Magdalene Described|first=R.|last=Hyam|publisher=Crampton &amp; Sons Ltd.|location=Sawston, Cambridgeshire, U.K.|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was designed to serve a scientific function as a [[telescope]] for observing [[Transit (astronomy)|transits]], though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that the movement of the column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the [[spiral staircase]], which has no central column, and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.

In the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, a pattern subsequently used in the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|renovation of Paris]], Liverpool, and many American cities.  This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights, as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries.  Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes, due to his competence as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator.

For an extensive study of Hooke's architectural work, see the book by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cooper | first = Michael | title = A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire | publisher = Sutton Publishing Ltd. | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-7509-2959-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Likenesses==
No authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists. This situation has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Newton, although Hooke's biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth the claims that Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke's portrait. German antiquarian and scholar [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit specifically mentions him being shown the portraits of 'Boyle and Hoock' (which were said to be good likenesses), but while Boyle's portrait survives, Hooke's has evidently been lost.&lt;ref name="rod.beavon.clara.net"&gt;[http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm Allan Chapman, "England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England", lecture from 'Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain', 67, 239–275 (1996), also given at Westminster School as the 1997 Sir Henry Tizard Memorial Lecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030235901/http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hooke's time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College, but within a few months of Hooke's death Newton became the Society's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place.  When the move to new quarters finally was made a few years later, in 1710, Hooke's Royal Society portrait went missing, and has yet to be found.

Two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance have survived. The first was recorded by his close friend [[John Aubrey]], who described Hooke in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:

{{quote|He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale faced, and his face but little below, but his head is lardge, his eie full and popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He haz a delicate head of haire, browne, and of an excellent moist curle. He is and ever was temperate and moderate in dyet, etc.}}

The second is a rather unflattering description of Hooke as an old man, written by Richard Waller:

{{quote|As to his Person he was but despicable, being very crooked, tho' I have heard from himself, and others, that he was strait till about 16 Years of Age when he first grew awry, by frequent practising, with a Turn-Lath ... He was always very pale and lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and Bone, with a Meagre Aspect, his Eyes grey and full, with a sharp ingenious Look whilst younger; his nose but thin, of a moderate height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper lip thin; his Chin sharp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle size. He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hanging neglected over his Face uncut and lank...&lt;ref name="rod.beavon.clara.net"/&gt;}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, on 3 July 1939.  However, when the source was traced by [[Ashley Montagu]], it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke.  Moreover, Montagu found that two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance agreed with one another, but that neither matched the ''Time'''s portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Montagu, M. F. Ashley | title = A Spurious Portrait of Robert Hooke (1635–1703) | journal = Isis | volume = 33 | year = 1941 | pages = 15–17 | doi = 10.1086/358521}} See also 3 July 1939 issue of ''Time'' (p. 39).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, historian [[Lisa Jardine]] claimed that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jardine | first = Lisa | title = The Curious Life of Robert Hooke | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2003 | pages = 15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this claim was disproved by William Jensen of the [[University of Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.uc.edu/source/volfour/oesper2.html |title=Source- The UC Libraries Newsletter |publisher=Libraries.uc.edu |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait identified by Jardine depicts the Flemish scholar [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].

Other possible likenesses of Hooke include the following:
* A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man's head, which some have argued portrays Hooke.
* The engraved frontispiece to the 1728 edition of [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers' ''Cyclopedia'']] shows a drawing of a bust of Robert Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.she-philosopher.com/players/RHsplash.html |title=Robert Hooke |publisher=she-philosopher.com |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the drawing is based on an actual work of art is unknown.

The window was destroyed in the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

In 2003 history painter [[Rita Greer]] embarked on a self-funded project to memorialise Hooke. The Rita Greer Robert Hooke project aimed to produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, that fitted his contemporary descriptions by John Aubrey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Aubrey | first = John | title = Brief Lives | publisher = Boydell Press; New edition |year=2009|isbn= }}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Waller.&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; Greer's images of Hooke, his life and work have been used for TV programmes in UK and US, in books, magazines and for PR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Burgan | first = Michael | title = Robert Hooke Natural Philosopher and Scientific Explorer | publisher = Compass Point Books|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2008 | pages = Cover,  21, 26, 45, 65, 77, 88, 96, 98–99, 101| isbn = 978-0756533151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fekany Lee | first = Kimberly | title = Cell Scientists:  from Leeuwenhoek to Fuchs | publisher = Compass Point Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-7565-3964-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = England's Leonardo Robert Hooke and the Seventeenth-Century Scientific Revolution | publisher = Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = Portrait of Robert Hooke inside dust jacket and last page of plates | isbn = 978-0-7503-0987-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Gresham College memorial portrait of Robert Hooke | journal = Dome, the Magazine of the Friends of St. Paul's Cathedral | issue = 46 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chapman | first = Allan | title = Robert Hooke: the forgotten genius of physics | journal = Interactions | issue = April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rita's portraits of Hooke sought after across UK | journal = Petersfield Post | issue = 21 May | year = 2008 | page  = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Unveiling of memorial portrait of Robert Hooke as astronomer and inventor | journal = Openhouse.

'''Shakespeare's influence''' extends from theatre and literature to present-day movies, [[Western philosophy]], and the English language itself.

Cranberry, NJ: Associated University Presses. p. 82. {{ISBN|0-8386-3970-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the [[English-speaking world]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5160 The Literary Encyclopedia entry on William Shakespeare] by Lois Potter, [[University of Delaware]], accessed 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-10434-0/the-columbia-dictionary-of-shakespeare-quotations The Columbia Dictionary of Shakespeare Quotations], edited by Mary Foakes and [[Reginald Foakes]], June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and [[neologism]]s have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages.

==Changes in English at the time==
[[Early Modern English]] as a literary medium was unfixed in structure and vocabulary in comparison to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and was in a constant state of flux. When [[William Shakespeare]] began writing his plays, the English language was rapidly absorbing words from other languages due to wars, exploration, diplomacy and colonization. By the age of Elizabeth, [[English language|English]] had become widely used with the expansion of philosophy, theology and physical sciences, but many writers lacked the vocabulary to express such ideas. To accommodate this, writers such as [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]] expressed new ideas and distinctions by inventing, borrowing or adopting a word or a phrase from another language, known as [[neologism|neologizing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/blog/shakespeare/words-shakespeare-invented/|title=The 422 Words That Shakespeare Invented|last=Litcharts|first=|date=November 30, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Scholars estimate that, between the years 1500 and 2018, nouns, verbs and modifiers of Latin, Greek and modern Romance languages added 30,000 new words to the [[English language]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Influence on theatre==
Shakespeare's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in [[Western literature]]&lt;ref name = Gaskell&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaskell |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Gaskell |title=Landmarks in English Literature |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location= |pages=13–14 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (with ''[[Macbeth]], [[Hamlet]]''
and ''[[King Lear]]'' being ranked among the world's greatest plays),&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Calvin Smith; Harrison, Robert L. ''Masterworks of World Literature'' Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and [[language]].&lt;ref name = miola /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Edmund Kerchever |title=Shakespearean Gleanings |year=1944 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |pages=35 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mazzeno |first=Laurence W. |authorlink= |author2=Frank Northen Magills |author3=Dayton Kohler |title=Masterplots: 1,801 Plot Stories and Critical Evaluations of the World's Finest Literature |year=1996 |origyear=1949 |publisher=Salen Press |location= |pages=2837 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in plays like ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare "integrated characterization with plot," such that if the main character was different in any way, the plot would be totally changed.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Roland Mushat ''Shakespeare'' Routledge, 2005, page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre (previous to Shakespeare, romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy).&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, Jill L. "Introduction" to ''Romeo and Juliet'' by William Shakespeare, Oxford University Press, 2000, pages 49–50. In her discussion about gamma the play's genre, Levenson quotes scholar H.B. Charlton ''Romeo and Juliet'' creating a new genre of "romantic tragedy."&lt;/ref&gt; Through his [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to "introduce (characters), convey information, provide an [[Expository writing|exposition]] or reveal plans").&lt;ref&gt;Clemen, Wolfgang H., ''Shakespeare's Soliloquies'' Routledge, 1987, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
His plays exhibited "spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with mingling of comedy with tragedy".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; In ''[[King Lear]]'', Shakespeare had deliberately brought together two plots of different origins. Shakespeare's work is also lauded for its insight into emotion. His themes regarding the [[human condition]] make him more acclaimed than any of his contemporaries. Humanism and contact with popular thinking gave vitality to his language. Shakespeare's plays borrowed ideas from popular sources, [[folk tradition]]s, street pamphlets, and [[sermon]]s. Shakespeare also used [[wikt:groundling|groundling]]s widely in his plays. The use of groundlings "saved the drama from academic stiffness and preserved its essential bias towards entertainment in comedy
".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an outstanding example of "groundlings" quickness and response.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; Use of groundlings enhanced Shakespeare's work practically and artistically. He represented English people more concretely and not as puppets. His skills have found expression in chronicles, or history plays, and tragedies.

Shakespeare's earliest years were dominated by history plays and a few comedies that formed a link to the later written [[tragedy|tragedies]]. Nine out of eighteen plays he produced in the first decade of his career were chronicles or histories. His histories were based on the prevailing Tudor political thought. They portrayed the follies and achievements of kings, their misgovernment, church and problems arising out of these. "In shaping, compressing, and altering chronicles, Shakespeare gained the art of dramatic design; and in the same way he developed his remarkable insight into character, its continuity and its variation".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; His characters were very near to reality.

"Shakespeare's characters are more sharply individualized after Love's Labour's Lost". His [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] and [[Henry IV, Part 1|Bolingbroke]] are complex and solid figures whereas [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]] has more "humanity and comic gusto".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; The [[Falstaff]] trilogy is in this respect very important. Falstaff, although a minor character, has a powerful reality of its own. "Shakespeare uses him as a commentator who passes judgments on events represented in the play, in the light of his own super abundant comic vitality".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; Falstaff, although outside "the prevailing political spirit of the play", throws insight into the different situations arising in the play. This shows that Shakespeare had developed a capacity to see the plays as whole, something more than characters and expressions added together. In Falstaff trilogy, through the character of Falstaff, he wants to show that in society "where touchstone of conduct is success, and in which humanity has to accommodate itself to the claims of expediency, there is no place for Falstaff", a loyal human-being. This sentiment is so true even after centuries.

Shakespeare united the three main streams of literature: [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], poetry, and drama. To the versification of the English language, he imparted his eloquence and variety giving highest expressions with elasticity of language. The second, the sonnets and poetry, was bound in structure. He imparted economy and intensity to the language. In the third and the most important area, the drama, he saved the language from vagueness and vastness and infused actuality and vividness. Shakespeare's work in prose, poetry, and drama marked the beginning of modernization of English language by introduction of words and expressions, style and form to the language.

== Influence on European and American literature ==
{{Globalize|date=June 2011}}
Shakespeare is cited as an influence on a large number of writers in the following centuries, including major novelists such as [[Herman Melville]],&lt;ref name="Hovde"/&gt; [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref name="Gager 1996 163"/&gt; [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Millgate, Michael and Wilson, Keith, ''Thomas Hardy Reappraised: Essays in Honour of Michael Millgate'' University of Toronto Press, 2006, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kolin |first=Philip C. |title=Shakespeare and Southern Writers: A Study in Influence |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location= |page=124 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this influence include the large number of Shakespearean quotations throughout Dickens' writings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gager |first=Valerie L. |title=Shakespeare and Dickens: The Dynamics of Influence |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |page=251 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that at least 25 of Dickens' titles are drawn from Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gager |first=Valerie L. |title=Shakespeare and Dickens: The Dynamics of Influence |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |page=186 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Melville frequently used Shakespearean devices, including formal stage directions and extended [[soliloquy|soliloquies]], in ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, John. "Moby Dick as Revolution" ''The Cambridge Companion to Herman Melville'' Robert Steven Levine (editor). Cambridge University Press, 1998, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Shakespeare so influenced Melville that the novel's main [[antagonist]], Captain Ahab, is a classic Shakespearean tragic figure, "a great man brought down by his faults."&lt;ref name="Hovde"/&gt; Shakespeare has also influenced a number of English poets, especially [[Romanticism|Romantic poets]] such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] who were obsessed with [[self-consciousness]], a modern theme Shakespeare anticipated in plays such as ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref name="Dotterer 1989 108"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dotterer |first=Ronald L. |title=Shakespeare: Text, Subtext, and Context |year=1989 |publisher=Susquehanna University Press |location= |page=108 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's writings were so influential to English poetry of the 1800s that critic [[George Steiner]] has called all English poetic dramas from Coleridge to [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] "feeble variations on Shakespearean themes."&lt;ref name="Dotterer 1989 108"/&gt;

==Influence on the English language {{anchor|Language}} ==
Shakespeare's writings greatly influenced the entire English language. Prior to and during Shakespeare's time, the grammar and rules of English were not standardized.&lt;ref name="Barron'sHamlet2"&gt;Introduction to ''Hamlet'' by William Shakespeare, Barron's Educational Series, 2002, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; But once Shakespeare's plays became popular in the late seventeenth and eighteenth century, they helped contribute to the standardization of the English language, with many Shakespearean words and phrases becoming embedded in the English language, particularly through projects such as [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' which quoted Shakespeare more than any other writer.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Jack. ''Samuel Johnson's Dictionary: Selections from the 1755 Work that Defined the English Language''. Delray Beach, FL: Levenger Press (2002), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the scope of English literature by introducing new words and phrases,&lt;ref&gt;Mabillard, Amanda. Why Study Shakespeare? Shakespeare Online. 20 Aug 2000. (date when you accessed the information) &lt; http://www.shakespeare-online.com/biography/whystudyshakespeare.html &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; experimenting with [[blank verse]], and also introducing new poetic and grammatical structures. He also inspired modern terms commonly used in the twenty-first century, such as the word "swag", which derives from "swagger", first seen in the text of his plays "Henry V" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream".&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/48657/20-words-we-owe-william-shakespeare&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocabulary===

{{Wiktionary category|type=Shakespeare's vocabulary|category=English terms first attested in Shakespeare}}
Among Shakespeare's greatest contributions to the English language must be the introduction of new vocabulary and phrases which have enriched the language making it more colourful and expressive. Some estimates at the number of words coined by Shakespeare number in the several thousands. Warren King clarifies by saying that, "In all of his work – the plays, the sonnets and the narrative poems – Shakespeare uses 17,677 words: Of those, 1,700 were first used by Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/resources/shakespeare-words.html |title=Words Shakespeare Invented: List of Words Shakespeare Invented |publisher=Nosweatshakespeare.com |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also well known for [[loanword|borrowing]] from the classical literature and foreign languages.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; He created these words by "changing nouns into verbs, changing verbs into adjectives, connecting words never before used together, adding prefixes and suffixes, and devising words wholly original."&lt;ref name="shakespeare-online.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/biography/wordsinvented.html |title=Words Shakespeare Invented |publisher=Shakespeare-online.com |date=20 August 2000 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Shakespeare's original phrases are still used in conversation and language today. These include, but are not limited to; "seen better days, strange bedfellows, a sorry sight,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/phrases-sayings-shakespeare.html | title=Phrases coined by William Shakespeare | publisher=The Phrase Finder | accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "full circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0419_040419_shakespeare.html | title=Shakespeare's Coined Words Now Common Currency | publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] | date=22 April 2004 | accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare added a considerable number of words to the English language when compared to additions to English vocabulary made in other times.
Shakespeare helped to further develop style and structure to an otherwise loose, spontaneous language. Written [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] English stylistically closely followed the spoken language. The naturalness gave force and freedom since there was no formalized prescriptive [[grammar]] binding the expression. While lack of prescribed grammatical rules introduced vagueness in literature, it also expressed feelings with profound vividness and emotion which created, "freedom of expression" and "vividness of presentment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of English and American literature: An encyclopedia in eighteen volumes|editor1=A.W. Ward |editor2=A.R. Waller |editor3=W.P. Trent |editor4=J. Erskine |editor5=S.P. Sherman |editor6=C. Van Doren |location=Cambridge, England|publisher=University Press|date=2000|orig-year=First published 1907–21|isbn=1-58734-073-9|volume=III. Renascence and Reformation|chapter=XX. The Language from Chaucer to Shakespeare – 11. Elizabethan English as a literary medium|chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/213/2011.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a language which expressed feelings explicitly. Shakespeare's gift involved using the exuberance of the language and [[decasyllable|decasyllabic]] structure in prose and poetry of his plays to reach the masses and the result was "a constant two way exchange between learned and the popular, together producing the unique combination of racy tang and the majestic stateliness that informs the language of Shakespeare".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;

While it is true that Shakespeare created many new words (the Oxford English Dictionary records over 2,000&lt;ref&gt;Jucker, Andreas H. ''History of English and English Historical Linguistics''. Stuttgart: Ernst Klett Verlag (2000), page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;), an article in ''National Geographic'' points out the findings of historian Jonathan Hope who wrote in "Shakespeare's 'Native English'" that "the Victorian scholars who read texts for the first edition of the OED paid special attention to Shakespeare: his texts were read more thoroughly, and cited more often, so he is often credited with the first use of words, or senses of words, which can, in fact, be found in other writers."&lt;ref name="News.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0419_040419_shakespeare_2.html |title=Shakespeare's Coined Words Now Common Currency |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blank verse===
Many critics and scholars consider Shakespeare's first plays experimental, and believe the playwright was still learning from his own mistakes. Gradually his language followed the "natural process of artistic growth, to find its adequate projection in dramatic form".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; As he continued experimenting, his style of writing found many manifestations in plays. The dialogues in his plays were written in verse form and followed a decasyllabic rule.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In ''Titus Andronicus'', decasyllables have been used throughout. "There is considerable pause; and though the inflexibility of the line sound is little affected by it, there is a certain running over of sense".  His work is still experimental in ''Titus Andronicus''. However, in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' and ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', there is "perfect metre-abundance of rime [rhyme], plenty of prose, arrangement in stanza".  After these two comedies, he kept experimenting until he reached a maturity of style. "Shakespeare's experimental use of trend and style, as well as the achieved development of his blank verses, are all evidences of his creative invention and influences".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Through experimentation of [[trisyllable|tri-syllabic]] substitution and decasyllabic rule he developed the [[blank verse]] to perfection and introduced a new style.

"Shakespeare's blank verse is one of the most important of all his influences on the way the English language was written".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  He used the blank verse throughout in his writing career experimenting and perfecting it. The free speech rhythm gave Shakespeare more freedom for experimentation. "Adaptation of free speech rhythm to the fixed blank-verse framework is an outstanding feature of Shakespeare's poetry".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; The striking choice of words in common place blank verse influenced "the run of the verse itself, expanding into images which eventually seem to bear significant repetition, and to form, with the presentation of character and action correspondingly developed, a more subtle and suggestive unity".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; Expressing emotions and situations in form of a verse gave a natural flow to language with an added sense of flexibility and spontaneity.

===Poetry===
He introduced in poetry two main factors – "verbal immediacy and the moulding of stress to the movement of living emotion".&lt;ref name=Ford&gt;{{cite book|title=The Age of Shakespeare|editor=Borris Ford|location=Great Britain|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1955|pages=16,51,54,55,64,71,87,179,184,187,188,197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's words reflected passage of time with "fresh, concrete vividness" giving the reader an idea of the time frame.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; His remarkable capacity to analyze and express emotions in simple words was noteworthy:
{{Quote|"When my love swears that she is made of truth,&lt;br /&gt;
I do believe her, though I know she lies-"|(Sonnet CXXXVIII)}}
In the sonnet above, he has expressed in very simple words "complex and even contradictory attitudes to a single emotion".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;

The [[sonnet]] form was limited structurally, in theme and in expressions. Liveliness of Shakespeare's language and strict discipline of the sonnets imparted economy and intensity to his writing style. "It encouraged the association of compression with depth of content and variety of emotional response to a degree unparalleled in English".&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; Complex human emotions found simple expressions in Shakespeare's language.

'''Simon Pelloutier''' (Oct. 27, 1694 – Oct. 3, 1757) was a French historian, was born at [[Leipzig|Leipsic]], Germany, Oct. 27, 1694. His father, a merchant established at [[Lyon|Lyons]], had been driven from France by the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Aided by an excellent memory and a strong desire to educate himself, he studied at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], at [[Berlin]], and [[Geneva]]. Admitted to the evangelical ministry, he served the French churches of [[Buchholterberg|Buchholtz]] (1715), of [[Magdeburg|Madgeburg]] (1719), and of Berlin (1725), where he was the colleague of Lentant. In 1743 he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences at Berlin]], and was chosen for its librarian in 1745. He died at Berlin Oct. 3, 1757. 

His principal work is, ''Histoiare des Celtes et particulierement des Gaulois et des Germains depuis les temps fabuleux jusqua la prise de Roze par les Gaulois'' (La Haye, 1740-1750, 2 vols. 12mo). This edition is full of faults; Chiniac de la Bastide has given a second, revised and enlarged after the MSS. of the author (Paris, 1771, 2 vols. 4to, or 8 vols. 12mo), which was translated into German by Purmann (Frankfort, 1777-1784, 3 vols. 8vo). "This work," says the ''Journal des Savants,'' "is very curious and agreeable in many respects; it is full of an extremely varied erudition. The author, not satisfied with proving what he advances, always accompanies his proofs with judicious reflections, from which he afterwards draws very extended conclusions, calculated to throw light upon the history and antiquities of all the different peoples of Europe." The editor has added to the ''Histoire des Celtes'' several dissertations by Pelloutier; among others the ''Discours sur les Galates,'' which gained for him in 1742 a prize from the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|French Academy of Inscriptions]]. See Brucker, ''Pinacotheca,'' dec. 3, No. 9; Formey, ''Eloges;'' Haag, ''La France Protestante.''

The '''Smethwick Engine''' is a [[Watt steam engine]] made by [[Boulton and Watt]], which was installed near [[Birmingham]], England, and was brought into service in May 1779. Now at [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]], it is the oldest working [[steam engine]]&lt;ref name="guinness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-steam-engine|title=Oldest steam engine|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thinktank-highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/thinktank/highlights|title=Highlights -  Thinktank - Birmingham Museums|work=birminghammuseums.org.uk|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest working [[engine]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Holland2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Julian|title=Amazing &amp; Extraordinary Facts Steam Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgozDvAxsR4C&amp;pg=PT18|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=2012-05-01|publisher=David &amp; Charles|isbn=9781446356197|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMECHE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imeche.org/news/institution/promoting-engineering-in-the-midlands|title=Promoting engineering in the Midlands|date=27 January 2014|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, it was one of two steam engines used to pump water back up to the {{convert|491|foot|m}} [[Water levels of the Birmingham Canal Navigations#491 ft Brindley's Smethwick_Summit|summit level]] of the [[BCN Main Line|BCN Old Main Line (Birmingham Canal)]] [[canal]] at [[Smethwick]], not far from the [[Soho Foundry]] where it was made. The other engine, also built by [[Boulton and Watt]], was at the other end of the summit level at Spon Lane. In 1804 a second Boulton and Watt engine was added alongside the 1779 engine.

The engines were needed because local water sources were insufficient to supply water to operate the six [[canal lock|lock]]s either side of the canal's original summit. The locks could have been avoided if a tunnel had been built, but the ground was too unstable for [[James Brindley]] to build a tunnel using the techniques available at the time. In the 1780s, a cutting was constructed by [[John Smeaton]], enabling three of the six locks on each side to be removed.

[[File:Engine Arm Aqueduct west.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Engine Arm Aqueduct]]]]
In the 1820s, [[Thomas Telford]] constructed a new canal parallel to the old in a deeper cutting, at the 453&amp;nbsp;ft [[Birmingham Level]], creating the largest man-made earthworks in the world at the time. It was spanned by the [[Galton Bridge]]. The engine was still needed, despite both these developments, and Thomas Telford constructed the [[Engine Arm Aqueduct]] carrying the [[Engine Arm]] branch canal over his New Main Line so that coal could still be transported along the arm to feed the Smethwick Engine.

[[File:New Smethwick Pumping Station 2.jpg|thumb|New [[Smethwick]] Pumping Station]]
In 1892, a replacement engine was built in a new pumping house, now [[Grade II listed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1077154|desc=Smethwick New Pumping House|grade=II|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|219213|New pumping house, Grade II|accessdate=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; next to Brasshouse Lane, as the original Smethwick Engine was considered uneconomic to repair; the latter was removed for preservation in 1897-98 to the BCN, later [[British Waterways]], [[Ocker Hill]] depot where it remained until acquired by [[Birmingham City Council]]. It is now part of the collection of Birmingham Museums and is on display at [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]] at [[Millennium Point (Birmingham)|Millennium Point]]. It is the oldest working engine in the world.

[[File:Blue plaque Smethwick Engine.jpg|thumb|[[Blue plaque]] at the site of the Smethwick Engine]]
The engine house was demolished in 1897. Its original site and foundations can still be seen on Bridge Street North in Smethwick, just north of the junction with Rolfe Street. Tours of the site can be arranged through the [[Galton Valley Canal Heritage Centre]] which is based in the New Smethwick Pumping Station and regularly opened by Sandwell Museum Service and The Friends of Galton Valley.

The pumping station was featured in an episode of ''The Water Boatman'' presented by [[Alan Herd]] on the [[Discovery Shed]] TV channel in November 2011.

'''''Speech of Universal History''''' or '''''Discours sur l'histoire universelle''''' in original French (1681) is a work of theology and philosophy from French Roman Catholic bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]]. It is regarded by many Catholics as a continuation or actualization of [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]’s the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' (''[[De Civitate Dei]]''). It proposes, much like the ''City of God'', a metaphysical appreciation of universal history as an actual war between God and the Devil.

==Spiritual warfare==
In this war, God moves (by divine intervention/ [[Divine providence]]) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God)  in order to oppose by all means (including military) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the Devil). While the City of God is always the Church and those movements or governments that support it, the City of the Devil changes significantly with the centuries.

==In Catholic doctrine==
This concept of universal history is actual part of the official doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]] as was most recently stated in the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council']] s ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' document: "The Church ... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings" (GS 10, 13, 45).

==Key points==
The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Oestreich (1913). Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;depicts the key point of ''Speech of Universal History'' as follows:

“…This is why the idea of Providence is at the same time the law of history. If the crash of empires "falling one upon another" does not in truth express some purpose of God regarding humanity, then history, or what is called by that name, is indeed no longer anything but a chaotic chronology, the meaning of which we should strive in vain to disentangle. In that case, fortune, or rather chance, would be the mistress of human affairs; the existence of humanity would be only a bad dream, or phantasmagoria, whose changing face would be inadequate to mask a void of nothingness. We should be fretting ourselves in that void without reason and almost without cause, our very actions would be but phantoms, and the only result of so many efforts accumulated through so many thousands of years would be the conviction, every day more clear, of their uselessness, which would be another void of nothingness.

And why, after all, were there Greeks and Romans? Of what use was [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]? [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]? [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]]? [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]]? Why was there a [[Caesar]], and a [[Charlemagne]]? Let us frankly own, then, that unless something Divine circulates in history, there is no history.

Nations like individuals, live only by maintaining uninterrupted communication with God, and it is precisely this condition of their existence which is called by the name of [[Divine providence|Providence]]. Providence is the condition or the possibility of history, as the stability of the laws of nature is the condition of the possibility of science. ..It was Providence that made of the Jewish people a people apart, a unique people, the chosen people, charged with maintaining and defending the worship of the true God throughout the pagan centuries, against the prestige of an idolatry which essentially consisted in the deification of the energies of nature. It was Providence that, by means of Roman unity and of its extension throughout the known universe, rendered not only possible but easy and almost necessary, the conversion of the world to Christianity .It was Providence, again, that developed the features of the modern world out of the disorder of barbarous invasions and reconciled the two antiquities under the law of Christ. If the action of Providence is manifest anywhere, it is in the sequence of the history of Christianity. And what is more natural under the circumstances than to make of its history the demonstration of its truth?"

'''''Theories of Forgetting''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by [[Fiction Collective Two]] in 2014.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''Theories of Forgetting'' is a novel made up of three intersecting narratives. The first involves the story of a middle-aged video artist, Alana, working on a short experimental video about [[Robert Smithson]]'s [[land art]] [[Spiral Jetty]]. The second involves the story of Alana’s husband, Hugh, and his slow disappearance throughout Europe and across Jordan on a trip there both to remember and to forget in the aftermath of Alana’s unexpected death. His vanishing is linked to the Sleeping Beauties, a rising global religious cult that worships barbiturates. The third narrative involves the story of their daughter, Aila, an art critic and conceptual artist living in Berlin, and the marginalia she writes in her father's manuscript she discovers after his disappearance.

Each of these narratives has its own unique form and texture. Alana’s takes the shape of a diary containing photographs, drawings, newspaper clippings, and meditations on Smithson’s oeuvre, with which she becomes increasingly obsessed. Hugh’s is a more conventional third-person narrative, its voice numbed, disoriented, in the wake of his wife's unexpected death. Aila's notes exist only in the margins of Hugh's text.

Each page of the novel is divided in half. One narrative runs across the “top” from “front” to “back,” while the other runs “upside down” across the “bottom” of the page from “back” to “front.” In a sense, then, the novel’s physical structure suggests a spiral. ''Theories of Forgetting'' doesn't possess a front cover. Rather, it possesses two back ones. Opening it, the reader must choose what constitutes the privileged narrative, the one with which to begin, and that choice will exert pressure on the meaning she or he will make, since there are contradictory elements in the competing plots.

''Theories of Forgetting,'' then, is interested in the materiality of page as well as in such thematic questions as death and the problem of memory and history.

==Reception==
''The Collagist'' commented that with ''Theories of Forgetting'' "Olsen delivers what could be called a 'destructuralized' novel that successfully resists the temptation of a conventional narrative strategy, yet for a novel that so self-consciously flashes its experimental bona fides, ''Theories'' remains eminently readable. Innovation and accessibility need not be in opposition to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theories of Forgetting|url=http://thecollagist.com/the-collagist/2014/11/3/theories-of-forgetting-by-lance-olsen.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|journal=The Collagist|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Quarterly conversation'' called Olsen's novel "a masterful work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theories of Forgetting|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/theories-of-forgetting-by-lance-olsen|accessdate=26 July 2016|journal=The Quarterly Conversation|date=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bronze Age and Early Iron Age ==
{{for|earlier events|Timeline of human prehistory}}
The [[Bronze Age]] was the period in human cultural development when the most advanced metalworking (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally-occurring outcroppings of copper ores, and then combining those ores to cast bronze. These naturally-occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before 3000 BC. In some parts of the world, a [[Copper Age]] follows the [[Neolithic]] and precedes the Bronze Age.

The [[Iron Age]] was the stage in the development of any people in which tools and weapons whose main ingredient was iron were prominent. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in some past societies often including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, although this was not always the case.&lt;!--

Do not add any earlier times to this list. Earlier times belong in "Timeline of human prehistory" --&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==
{{Main|Classical antiquity}}

[[Classical antiquity]] is a broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. It refers to the [[timeframe]] of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;It is used to refer to various other periods of ancient history, like [[Ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Mesopotamia]] (such as, Assyria, Babylonia and Sumer) or other [[early civilizations of the Near East]]. It is less commonly used in reference to [[civilizations of the Far East]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYtAAAAIAAJ A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]. J. Murray, 1891&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient history includes the recorded [[Greek history]] beginning in about 776 BC (First [[Olympiad]]). This coincides roughly with the traditional date of the founding of Rome in 753 BC and the beginning of the [[history of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Scarre, ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome'' (London: Penguin Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Lesley; Roy Adkins (1998).

==End of ancient history in Europe==
The date used as the end of the ancient era is arbitrary. The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the [[Early Middle Ages]] is known as [[Late Antiquity]]. Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages, in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. AD 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]]. The [[Early Middle Ages]] are a period in the history of [[Europe]] following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] spanning roughly five centuries from AD 500 to 1000. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. [[Western culture|Western]] scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in AD 476, the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in AD 565, or the [[coming of Islam]] in AD 632 as the end of [[Classical Antiquity|ancient European history]].

A '''tudun''' was a [[governor]] [[Resident-General|resident]] in a town or other settlement in the ancient [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Avar Khaganate|Avar]] or [[Gokturk]] [[empire]]s, particularly those of the [[Bulgars]] and the [[Khazars]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}. In [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[wikt:𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌰𐌽𐍃|''þiudans'']] means "king" (literally "leader of the people", hence "prince, lord, ruler, chief"). The tudun was the personal representative of the imperial government and could function both as an administrator and a diplomat. At times, a tudun would be appointed for a town nominally under another power's control but ''de facto'' within the sphere of influence of the tudun's [[khagan]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4367">The '''Tungusic creation myths''' are traditional stories of the creation of the world belonging to the [[Tungusic peoples]] of [[Siberia]].  

==Account of creation==

In one account of their creation myth initially there was a vast primordial ocean.  [[Buga (deity)|Buga]], their central deity, set fire to this water, and following a long struggle the flames consumed much of the water, exposing dry, hard land. Then Buga created the light and separated it from darkness, and descended to the newly created land. There he confronted [[Buninka]], the devil, and a dispute arose between them over who had created the world. Buninka was spiteful and tried to injure Buga's creation.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, col.1}}

Buninka broke Buga's twelve-stringed lyre, and Buga angrily challenged Buninka to make a [[fir]] tree and raise it to stand fast and firm in the middle of the sea. Buga agreed he would bow to Buninka's powers if he could do so, but if he failed then Buga would subject himself to the same challenge. If Buga were then to succeed, Buninka must concede to Buga that he was the most powerful creator. Buninka agreed to the challenge and commanded a fir tree to rise from the sea. The tree grew, but it was weak and swayed to and fro, whilst Buga's tree was good.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, col.1}} Buninka was forced to acknowledge Buga's greater power and bowed in homage.  Buga put his hand to Buninka's head and turned it to iron.  This caused so much pain in Buninka that he begged Buga for release, and Buga relented, releasing Buninka to be allowed to wander the earth on conditionhe did no harm to man.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, cols.1-2}}

Buga then collected materials to make mankind. From the east he gathered iron; from the south fire; the west, water; and from the north, earth. From the earth he made flesh and bone; from the iron he made heart; from the water he made blood; and from the fire he gave them vitality, and thus he made two beings, a man and a woman.. After they had increased in numbers Buninka he wanted to claim half as his own. Buga refused to give him any of the living but Buninka was granted the vicious men and women after they had died, Buga keeping the virtuous to himself.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, col.2}}  So after death, the evil join Buninka in hell, which is in the center of the earth.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, col.2}} Hell consisted of twelve caves, each with a different form of punishment.{{sfn|Y.Z.|1824|loc=p.595, col.2}}

===Alternate versions===
Almost identical versions of this myth are recounted in {{harv|Leeming|2009|p=266}} and {{harv|Sproul|2013|p=217}}, but the creator is referred to as "God", and not 'Buga'. 

A similar myth of creation of man from four elements by [[Buga (god)|Buga]] is given in {{harv|Holmberg|1964}} from {{harv|Spasskiy|1822|p=34}}.

The '''World Trade Center Health Program''' (WTC Health Program) provides medical benefits to specific groups of individuals affected by the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=wtchp-site&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center Health Program|url=https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTC Health Program was established by Title I of the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]] (Zadroga Act), P.L. 111-347, which amended the [[Public Health Service Act]]. The [[United States Congress]] passed the bill in December 2010 and [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed it into law on January 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-226/0226-010510-act.pdf|title=James L.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is component of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).

The [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] towers on September 11, 2001 (9/11) caused physical hazards as well as massive [[dust cloud]], consisting of pulverized building materials, electronic equipment, and furniture to blanket the [[World Trade Center site]] and the surrounding area. Many 9/11 responders, local workers, and resident survivors have since developed respiratory diseases, digestive disorders, cancers, or mental health disorders as a result of these toxic exposures. The WTC Health Program provides screening and treatment for a specific list of 9/11-related conditions.

As of 2011, approximately 18,000 people have received medical treatment for illnesses related to toxic dust from the World Trade Center site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14738140|title=Toxic dust legacy of 9/11 plagues thousands of people|publisher=BBC News|first=David|last=Shukman|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grady|first=Denise|title=Lung Function of 9/11 Rescuers Fell, Study Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/nyregion/08lung.html|accessdate=2011-09-04|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a major research study showed significant long term medical and psychological effects among first responders to the World Trade Center site. These effects include elevated levels of [[asthma]], [[sinusitis]], [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110901214424.htm "First Long-Term Study of WTC Workers Shows Widespread Health Problems 10 Years After Sept. 11".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents, students, and office workers of [[Lower Manhattan]] and nearby [[Chinatown]] have also reported negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Updated Ground Zero Report Examines Failure of Government to Protect Citizens| publisher=Sierra Club| year=2006| url=http://www.sierraclub.org/groundzero/| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims' names have been included in the World Trade Center memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Smith| first=Stephen| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/28/national/main4049362.shtml| title=9/11 "Wall Of Heroes" To Include Sick Cops| publisher=CBS News| date=April 28, 2008| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the [[New York State Department of Health]] had documented at least 204 deaths of rescue and recovery workers since September 11, 2001. 77 of these individuals died of illnesses, including 55 from lung and various other cancers.  Kitty Gelberg, New York state Bureau of Occupational Health's chief epidemiologist said, "We're not saying they are all World Trade Center related; we're just saying this is what people are dying from."  Many of the 55 responders who died from cancer had cancer before September 11, 2001, but most of the cancer patients developed the disease afterward.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Susan Edelman, "Charting post-9/11 deaths", ''New York Post'', January 6, 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Zadroga Act health programs ===

In 2002, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, both the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[American Red Cross]] provided grants to launch the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) in response to individuals developing health issues related to the disaster. The [[United States Congress]] passed appropriations to provide limited health screening and treatment services to World Trade Center responders. The MMTP has received approximately $475 million from the federal government. Over 57,000 people met the program's initial eligibility requirements. On July 1, 2011, MMTP became a part of the World Trade Center Health Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41292.pdf Comparison of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the World Trade Center Health Program Created by Title I of P.L. 111-347, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Center Environmental Health Center (EHC) was also established after the  9/11 terrorist attacks to treat WTC-related illnesses. This program consisted of three locations in and around New York City. On September 30, 2008, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) awarded the New York City [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation|Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC)]] a grant to be administered by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), to provide health services to non-responder populations in New York City affected by the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080930.htm Press Release,  "CDC Awards $10 million to New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation to provide Health Services to Residents, Other Community Members Affected by 9/11 Attack,"  September 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the grant, HHC provided medical examinations, diagnostic testing, referral and treatment for residents, students, and others in the community that were directly affected by the dust and debris from the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehhcfoundation.org/MajorGrant.html HHC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehhcfoundation.org/partners.html HHC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of the James Zadroga Act, the WTC EHC became part of the WTC Health Program.

In 2002 the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] and the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Health Department]] launched the World Trade Center Health Registry in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. By tracking and investigating illnesses, the WTC Health Registry strives to monitor the health of people exposed to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTC Health Registry|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/html/registry/registry.shtml|work=9/11 Health|publisher=New York City Health Department|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTC Health Registry continues to release annual reports on new findings regarding the health effects resulting from the terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTC Health Registry 2011 Report|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/downloads/pdf/registry/wtchr-annual-report2011.pdf|publisher=World Trade Center Health Registry|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2006, then-[[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] signed legislation to expand death benefits to Ground Zero workers who die from cancer or respiratory diseases, presumably from exposures to hazardous materials and toxins during recovery efforts. At the bill-signing ceremony, held at the World Trade Center site, Pataki mentioned [[James Zadroga]], a [[New York Police Department]] officer and 9/11 responder who had fallen ill following the terrorist attacks and died of lung disease in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/nyregion/15benefits.html "Pataki Signs Law Increasing Death Benefits for Ground Zero Workers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 15, 2006. Accessed September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; James Zadroga would become the namesake of the federal bill that created the WTC Health Program in 2011.

=== James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act ===
{{Main|James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act}}
[[File:Obama signs Zadroga Act.jpg|thumb|300px|President Obama signing the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 into law, January 2, 2011 at [[Plantation Estate]] in Hawaii.]]

Originally introduced in 2006 and eventually made law in 2011, the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 funds and establishes a health program to provide medical treatment for responders and survivors who experienced or may experience health complications related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Senator [[Bob Menendez]] and Congresswoman [[Carolyn Maloney]] initially co-sponsored the bill, which failed to pass in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-3891 S. 3891 - 109th], James Zadroga Act of 2006 (GovTrack.us)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-6045 H.R. 6045 &amp;mdash; 109th], James Zadroga Act of 2006 (GovTrack.us)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Senate vote held on December 9, 2010, Democrats were unable to break a Republican [[filibuster]] against the bill.&lt;ref name="filibuster"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hernandez| first = Raymond| title = Republicans Block U.S. Health Aid for 9/11 Workers| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A28| date = December 10, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/nyregion/10health.html| accessdate = 2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With only 57 votes to end the Senate filibuster and an incoming influx of Republicans in the wake of the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 Congressional Elections]], the bill's future looked increasingly doubtful towards the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=time_stewart&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton-Small|first=Jay|title=Did Jon Stewart Turn the Tide on the 911 First Responders Bill?|url=http://swampland.time.com/2010/12/20/did-jon-stewart-turn-the-tide-on-the-911-first-responders-bill/|work=TIME Swampland|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2010, New York Senators [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] introduced a $6.2 billion version of the bill paid for in part by closing a corporate tax loophole and in part by a 2% [[excise]] tax on foreign goods that did not include countries with international procurement agreements with the U.S.&lt;ref name=dem_senators&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=New York's Dem senators see breakthrough on 9/11 healthcare bill|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/134433-new-york-senators-see-breakthrough-on-911-healthcare-bill|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Hill|date=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time_stewart/&gt; On December 22, 2010, Congress approved the final bill, which allocated $4.2 billion towards the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/politics/911.bill_1_first-responders-funding-votes-house-members?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Bloomberg urges passage of 9/11 health bill | date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President Barack Obama signed the Zadroga Act into law on January 2, 2011.

'''Xenoarchaeology''', branch of [[xenology]] dealing with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]], is a [[protoscience|hypothetical]] form of [[archaeology]] that exists mainly in works of [[science fiction]]. The field is concerned with the study of material remains to reconstruct and interpret past life-ways of alien civilizations. Xenoarchaeology is not currently practiced by mainstream archaeologists due to the current lack of any material for the discipline to study.

==Etymology==
The name derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''xenos'' (ξένος) which means 'stranger, alien', and [[archaeology]] 'study of ancients'.

Xenoarchaeology is sometimes called ''astroarchaeology'' or ''exoarchaeology'', although some would argue that the prefix exo- would be more correctly applied to the study of human activities in a space environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Freitas| first= Robert| title= Naming Extraterrestrial Life| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/NamingETL.htm}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;!--Correspondence to Nature Vol. 301(13), 13 January 1983, p 106.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for xenoarchaeology, or specialised fields of interest, include Probe [[SETI]] (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), extraterrestrial archaeology, space archaeology, SETA (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Artifacts), Dysonian SETI, Planetary SETI, SETT (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Technology), SETV (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Visitation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Darling| first= David| title= SETA (Search for Extraterrestrial Artifacts)| url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SETA.html}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; extraterrestrial anthropology, areoarchaeology and selenoarchaeology.&lt;ref name="matthews"&gt;Matthews, Keith, 2002, Archaeology and the Extraterrestrial, in Miles Russell (ed), Digging Holes in Popular Culture, Bournemouth University School of Conservation Sciences Occasional Paper 7, Oxbow Books, Oxford, pp. 129–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification==
It is arguably the case that, due to the immense distances between stars, any evidence we discover of extraterrestrial intelligence, whether it be an artifact or an electromagnetic signal, may come from a long-vanished civilization. Thus the entire SETI project can be seen as a form of archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=SETI League| title= They're Dead, Jim!| url= http://www.setileague.org/askdr/dead.htm}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Astrobiology Magazine| url=http://seti.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=120&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0| title=Future Archaeology| date=5 October 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929093248/http://seti.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=120&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0| archivedate=29 September 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Tarter| first=Jill| url=http://discuss.longnow.org/viewtopic.php?t=22| date=9 July 2004| title=Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence – A Necessarily Long-Term Strategy| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813140543/http://discuss.longnow.org/viewtopic.php?t=22| archivedate=13 August 2006| df=dmy-all}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, due to the extreme [[age of the universe]], there may be a reasonable expectation for [[astrobiology]] research to produce evidence of extinct [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] life prior to the discovery of alien life itself.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;{{cite journal| last=McGee| first= Ben| issue= 26|date=November 2010| title=A Call for Proactive Xenoarchaeological Guidelines: Scientific, International Policy, and Socio-Political Considerations| journal=Space Policy| doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2010.08.003| volume=26| page=209}}, retrieved 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicky Walsh argued for the existence of "exo-artifacts" using the [[mediocrity principle|principle of mediocrity]] and the [[Drake equation]]. She proposed that a theoretical and speculative field of archaeology be established in order to test outlandish claims, and to prepare for a time when undeniably extraterrestrial artifacts needed to be analysed. "If it is possible to construct an abstract archaeology that can be tested and refined on earth and then applied to areas beyond our planet, then the claims for ETI remains on the moon and Mars may really be evaluated in light of established archaeological theory and analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Vicky, 2002, The case for exo-archaeology, in Miles Russell (ed), Digging Holes in Popular Culture, Bournemouth University School of Conservation Sciences Occasional Paper 7, Oxbow Books, Oxford, pp. 121–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben McGee similarly proposed the creation of a set of interdisciplinary, proactive xenoarchaeological guidelines, arguing that identifying suspected artifacts of astrobiology is all that is required to justify establishing a methodology for xenoarchaeology.  He emphasized the necessity of proactive xenoarchaeological work in order to avoid future bias, mischaracterization, and information mismanagement, and he cites three scenarios under which such a methodology or set of guidelines would be useful, those being "[[remote sensing]]" of a potential xenoarchaeologial artifact, encountering an artifact during "human exploration,"  and "terrestrial interception" of an artifact.&lt;ref name="mcgee" /&gt;

Greg Fewer has argued that archaeological techniques should be used to evaluate alleged UFO landing or crash sites, such as [[Roswell UFO Incident|Roswell]].&lt;ref&gt;Fewer, G.

==History==
The origins of the field have been traced&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Mark Q. &amp; Yohe, Robert M., II 2003, Archaeology: The Science of the Human Past, Allyn &amp; Bacon, Boston, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; to theories about a hypothetical Martian civilization based on observations of what were perceived as [[Martian canals|canals on Mars]]. These theories, of which Percival Lowell was the most famous exponent, were apparently inspired by a mistranslation of a quote by [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]].

The 1997 Theoretical Archaeology Group conference featured a session on "archaeology and science fiction".

The 2004 annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] featured a session ''Anthropology, Archaeology and Interstellar Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&amp;b=617353,{{Dead link|date=October 2011}} retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary SETI==
Planetary SETI is concerned with the search for extraterrestrial structures on the surface of bodies in the [[Solar System]]. Claims for evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts can be divided into three groups, the Moon, Mars, and the other planets and their satellites.&lt;ref name="matthews" /&gt;

Examples of sites of interest include the "bridge" sighted in the [[Mare Crisium]] in 1953, and the "Blair Cuspids", "an unusual arrangement of seven spirelike objects of varying heights" at the western edge of the ''[[Mare Tranquillitatis]]'', photographed by in [[Lunar Orbiter 2]] on [[November 1966|November 20, 1966]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Proud, ''The Secret Influence of the Moon: Alien Origins and Occult Powers'' (Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ian Crawford proposed that a search for alien artifacts be conducted on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Groshong| first= Kimm| url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9173-looking-for-aliens-on-the-moon.html| title= Looking for aliens on the Moon| date=16 May 2006 | publisher=New Scientist}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Percival Lowell]]'s mistaken identification of [[Martian canals]] was an early attempt to detect and study an alien culture from its supposed physical remains.  More recently, there was interest in the supposed [[Face on Mars]].

The Society for Planetary SETI Research is a loose organization of researchers interested in this field. The organization does not endorse any particular conclusions drawn by its members on particular sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Society for Planetary SETI Research |url= http://spsr.utsi.edu/}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probe SETI, or SETA==
{{see|Bracewell probe}}
A great deal of research and writing has been done, and some searches conducted for extraterrestrial probes in the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stride| first= S.| title= Probing for ETI's Probes in the Solar System| url= http://www.setileague.org/editor/stride2.htm}}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the work of [[Ronald N.

Robert A. Freitas coined the Term SETA in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Csaba Kecskes: ''Observation of Asteroids for Searching Extraterrestrial Artifacts.'' in: Viorel Badescu: ''Asteroids - prospective energy and material resources.''

On the basis that the Earth-Moon or Sun-Earth [[libration orbit]]s might constitute convenient parking places for automated extraterrestrial probes, unsuccessful searches were conducted by Freitas and Valdes.&lt;ref&gt;Freitas, R. &amp; Valdes, F., [http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SearchIcarus1980.htm A Search for Natural or Artificial Objects Located at the Earth-Moon Libration Points], retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;!--Icarus 42, 442-447 (1980) Received 29 October 1979; revised 4 April 1980--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valdes, F. &amp; Freitas, R., [http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SearchIcarus1983.htm A Search for Objects near the Earth-Moon Lagrangian Points], retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;!--Icarus 53, 453-457 (1983)
Received 16 September 1982; revised 18 November 1982--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dysonian SETI==
In a 1960 paper, [[Freeman Dyson]] proposed the idea of a [[Dyson sphere]], a type of extraterrestrial artifact able to be searched for and studied at interstellar distances. Following that paper, several searches have been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Carrigan, D., [http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Other_searches.htm Other Dyson Sphere searches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716233413/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Other_searches.htm |date=16 July 2012 }}, retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting smaller, though still mega-scale, artifacts from their distinctive transit [[light curve]] signature.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, L., [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503580 Transit Lightcurve Signatures of Artificial Objects], retrieved 29 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Astroengineering]])''.

==Fringe theories==
A subculture of enthusiasts studies purported structures on the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. These controversial "structures" (such as the [[Face on Mars]]) are not accepted as more than natural features by most scientists, examples of the [[pareidolia]] phenomenon.

Palaeocontact or [[Ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut]] theories, espoused by [[Erich von Däniken]] and others, are further examples of fringe theories. These claim that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings.

==Science fiction==
Xenoarchaeological themes are common in science fiction. Works about the exploration of enigmatic extraterrestrial artifacts have been satirically categorized as [[Big Dumb Object]] stories.

Some of the more prominent examples of xenoarchaeological fiction include Arthur C. Clarke's novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', H. Beam Piper's short story ''[[Omnilingual]]'', and Charles Sheffield's [[Heritage Universe]] series.

[[Jack McDevitt]]'s science fiction novels often revolve around human or alien historical and archaeological mysteries.

''[[Mass Effect]]'''s plot revolves around technologies in the form of structures, transportation, buildings and machines left behind by an extinct alien race.

The primary setting of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' takes place on a massive structure created by an ancient, extinct alien super race. These structures feature prominently in the sequels ''[[Halo 2]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', and ''[[Halo 4]]''.

In the video game "[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]", and its sequel "[[Borderlands 2]]", the Atlas corporation started mining the planet Pandora after finding evidence of an ancient material called Eridium. This material was supposedly created by extraterrestrial creatures or is a natural product of long-term planetary production.

In the video game "[[Stellaris_(video_game)|Stellaris]]", players usually found extraterrestrial artifacts from a extinct civilization before actually encounter native space creatures or other extraterrestrial civilizations.Such discovery would also raise a "Exist of extraterrestrial life has been proven" news event.
