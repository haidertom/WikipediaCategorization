The '''2002 Eastern Mediterranean Event''' was a high-energy [[upper atmosphere]] [[explosion]] over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], around 34°N 21°E (between [[Libya]] and [[Crete]]) on June 6, 2002.&lt;ref name="USSC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Space Command]] |title=Speech by Gen.

The object disintegrated in an [[air burst]] impact and no meteorite fragments were recovered. The air burst occurred over the sea.

The event occurred during the [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff]], and there were concerns by General [[Pete Worden|Simon Worden]] of the U.S. Air Force that if the upper atmosphere explosion had occurred closer to [[Pakistan]] or [[India]], it could have sparked a [[nuclear war]] between the two countries.&lt;ref name="spacedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-02s.html | title=Near-Earth Objects Pose Threat, General Says | work=Space Daily | publisher= | date=2002-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17863">High-precision experiments could reveal
small previously unseen differences between the behavior
of matter and antimatter.
This prospect is appealing to physicists because it may
show that nature is not Lorentz symmetric.

== Introduction ==
Ordinary matter is made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons.
The quantum behavior of these particles can be predicted with excellent accuracy
using the [[Dirac equation]], named after [[P.A.M. Dirac]].
One of the triumphs of the Dirac equation is
its prediction of the existence of antimatter particles.
[[Antiprotons]], [[positrons]], and [[antineutron]]s
are now well understood,
and can be created and studied in experiments.

High-precision experiments have been unable to
detect any difference between the masses
of particles and
those of the corresponding [[antiparticles]].
They also have been unable to detect any difference between the magnitudes of
the charges,
or between the lifetimes,
of particles and antiparticles.
These mass, charge, and lifetime symmetries
are required in a Lorentz and CPT symmetric universe,
but are only a small number of the properties that need to match
if the universe is Lorentz and CPT symmetric.

The [[Standard-Model Extension]] ([[Standard-Model Extension|SME]]),
a comprehensive theoretical framework for Lorentz and CPT violation,
makes specific predictions
about how particles and antiparticles
would behave differently in a universe
that is very close to,
but not exactly,
Lorentz symmetric.&lt;ref name="1.SME1"&gt;

In loose terms,
the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] can be visualized
as being constructed from
fixed background fields
that interact weakly, but differently,
with particles and antiparticles.

The behavioral differences between
matter and antimatter
are specific to each individual experiment.
Factors that determine the behavior include
the particle species involved,
the electromagnetic, gravitational, and nuclear fields controlling the system.
Furthermore,
for any Earth-bound experiment,
the rotational and orbital motion of the Earth is important,
leading to sidereal and seasonal signals.
For experiments conducted in space, the orbital motion of the craft
is an important factor in determining the signals
of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]] that might arise.
To harness the predictive power of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] in any specific system,
a calculation has to be performed
so that all these factors can be accounted for.
These calculations are facilitated by the reasonable assumption that Lorentz
violations, if they exist,
are small. This makes it possible to use perturbation theory to obtain results
that would otherwise be extremely difficult to find.

The [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] generates a modified [[Dirac equation]]
that breaks Lorentz symmetry
for some types of particle motions, but not others.
It therefore holds important information
about how [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violations]] might have been hidden
in past experiments,
or might be revealed in future ones.

== Lorentz violation tests with Penning Traps ==
A Penning trap
is a research apparatus
capable of trapping individual charged particles
and their antimatter counterparts.
The trapping mechanism is
a strong magnetic field that keeps the particles near a central axis,
and an electric field that turns the particles around
when they stray too far along the axis.
The motional frequencies of the trapped particle
can be monitored and measured with astonishing precision.
One of these frequencies is the anomaly frequency,
which has played an important role in the measurement
of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron (see {{section link|gyromagnetic ratio|gyromagnetic ratio for an isolated electron}}).

The first calculations of [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] effects
in [[Penning trap]]s
were published in 1997
and 1998.&lt;ref name="ptrap98"&gt;

They showed that,
in identical Penning traps,
if the
anomaly frequency of an [[electron]] was increased,
then the anomaly frequency of a [[positron]]
would be decreased.
The size of the increase or decrease
in the frequency
would be a measure of
the strength of one of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] background fields.
More specifically,
it is a measure
of the component of the background field
along the direction of the axial magnetic field.

In tests of Lorentz symmetry,
the noninertial nature of the laboratory
due to the rotational and orbital motion of the Earth
has to be taken into account.
Each Penning-trap measurement
is the projection of the background [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] fields
along the axis of the experimental magnetic field
at the time of the experiment.
This is further complicated if the experiment takes
hours, days, or longer to perform.

One approach is to seek instantaneous differences,
by comparing anomaly frequencies
for a particle and an antiparticle
measured at the same time on different days.
Another approach is to seek
sidereal variations,
by continuously monitoring
the anomaly frequency for just one species of particle
over an extended time.
Each offers different challenges.
For example,
instantaneous comparisons
require the electric field in the trap to be
precisely reversed,
while sidereal tests are limited
by the stability of the magnetic field.

An experiment conducted by the physicist Gerald Gabrielse of Harvard University involved two particles confined in a [[Penning trap]]. The idea was to compare a proton and an antiproton, but to overcome the technicalities of having opposite charges,
a negatively charged hydrogen ion was used in place of the proton. The ion, two electrons bound electrostatically with a [[proton]], and the antiproton have the same charge and can therefore be simultaneously trapped. This design allows for quick interchange of the proton and the antiproton and so an instantaneous-type Lorentz test can be performed. The cyclotron frequencies of the two trapped particles
were about 90&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the apparatus was capable of resolving differences
in these of about 1.0&amp;nbsp;Hz. The absence of Lorentz violating effects of this type
placed a limit on combinations of [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;-type SME coefficients]] that had not been accessed in other experiments. The results&lt;ref name="gabrielse99"&gt;
{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Gabrielse |first2=A. |last2=Khabbaz |first3=D.S. |last3=Hall |first4=C. |last4=Heimann |first5=H. |last5=Kalinowsky |first6=W. |last6=Jhe

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
appeared in Physical Review Letters in 1999.

The Penning-trap group at the [[University of Washington]], headed by the Nobel Laureate [[Hans Dehmelt]], conducted a search for sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency of a trapped electron. The results were extracted from an experiment that ran for several weeks, and the analysis required splitting the data into "bins" according to the orientation of the apparatus in the inertial reference frame of the Sun. At a resolution of 0.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, they were unable to discern any sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency, which runs around 185,000,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Translating this into an upper bound on the relevant
[[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] background field, places a bound of about
10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; [[GeV]] on a [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type electron coefficient]].

 |date=1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was published in Physical Review Letters in 1999.

Another experimental result from the Dehmelt group involved a comparison of the instantaneous type. Using data from a single trapped electron
and a single trapped positron, they again found no difference
between the two anomaly frequencies at a resolution of about 0.2&amp;nbsp;Hz.
This result placed a bound on a simpler combination of
[[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type coefficients]] at a level of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; GeV.
In addition to being a limit on [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]],
this also limits the CPT violation.

== Lorentz violation in antihydrogen ==
The antihydrogen atom is
the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom.
It has a negatively charged antiproton
at the nucleus
that attracts a positively charged positron
orbiting around it.

The spectral lines of hydrogen have frequencies
determined by the energy differences
between the quantum-mechanical orbital states
of the electron.
These lines
have been studied in thousands of spectroscopic experiments
and are understood in great detail.
The quantum mechanics of the positron orbiting an antiproton
in the antihydrogen atom is expected to be very similar
to that of the hydrogen atom.
In fact,
conventional physics predicts that the spectrum of antihydrogen
is identical to that of regular hydrogen.

In the presence of the background fields of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]],
the spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen
are expected to show tiny differences
in some lines,
and no differences in others.
Calculations of these [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] effects
in antihydrogen and hydrogen
were published&lt;ref name="hbar99"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Bluhm |first2=V.A. |last2=Kostelecky |first3=N. |last3=Russell
 |title=CPT and Lorentz Tests in Hydrogen and Antihydrogen
 |date=1999

in Physical Review Letters
in 1999.
One of the main results found
is that hyperfine transitions
are sensitive to Lorentz breaking effects.

Several experimental groups at [[CERN]]
are working on producing antihydrogen.
They are:

* [[AEGIS (particle physics)#AEGIS|AEGIS]]
* [[Antiproton Decelerator#ALPHA|ALPHA]]
* [[ASACUSA]]
* [[ATRAP]]

Creating trapped antihydrogen
in sufficient quantities
to do spectroscopy
is an enormous experimental challenge.
Signatures of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]]
are similar to those expected in Penning traps.
There would be sidereal effects
causing variations in the spectral frequencies
as the experimental laboratory turns with the Earth.
There would also be the possibility of finding instantaneous
Lorentz breaking signals
when antihydrogen spectra are compared directly with conventional hydrogen spectra

In October 2017, the [[BASE experiment]] at [[CERN]] reported a measurement of the [[antiproton]] [[magnetic moment]] to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |pages=371–374 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the [[proton]] magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of [[CPT symmetry]]. It should be noted that this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.

== Lorentz violation with muons ==
The [[muon]] and its positively charged antiparticle
have been used to perform tests of Lorentz symmetry.
Since the lifetime of the [[muon]] is only a few microseconds,
the experiments are quite different
from ones with electrons and positrons.
Calculations for [[muon]] experiments
aimed at probing [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]]
in the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]]
were first published in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="bkl00"&gt;
{{cite journal

In the year 2001,
Hughes and collaborators published their results
from a search for sidereal signals in the spectrum
of muonium,
an ''atom'' consisting of an electron bound to a negatively charged muon.
Their data,
taken over a two-year period,
showed no evidence for [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]].
This placed a stringent constraint on
a combination of [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type coefficients]] in the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]],
published in Physical Review Letters.&lt;ref name="hughes01"&gt;

In 2008,
the Muon &lt;math&gt;g-2&lt;/math&gt; Collaboration at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] published results after searching for signals of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]] with muons and antimuons.
In one type of analysis, they compared the anomaly frequencies
for the muon and its antiparticle. In another, they looked for sidereal variations by allocating their data into one-hour "bins" according to the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun-centered inertial reference frame.
Their results, published in Physical Review Letters in 2008,&lt;ref name="bennett08"&gt;

'''''Big Coal: The Dirty Secret Behind America's Energy Future''''' is a book by [[Jeff Goodell]] which claims that [[coal mining]] is one of America's largest and most influential industries.  Goodell suggests that coal mining is deadly and environmentally destructive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=694238 Big Coal: The Dirty Secret Behind America's Energy Future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25powell.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin Black Cloud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-149612504.html Big Coal: The Dirty Secret Behind America's Energy Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs in certain theories of [[cosmology]], is a hypothetical substance that satisfies an exotic [[equation of state]] in the form
&lt;math&gt;
p = -A/\rho^\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density, with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a positive constant. The substance is named after [[Sergey Chaplygin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1686">'''Chilton–Colburn J-factor analogy''' is a successful and widely used analogy between [[heat transfer|heat]], [[momentum]], and [[mass transfer]]. The basic mechanisms and mathematics of heat, mass, and momentum transport are essentially the same. Among many analogies (like [[Reynolds analogy]], Prandtl–Taylor analogy) developed to directly relate [[heat transfer]] coefficients, [[mass transfer]] coefficients, and [[friction]] factors Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy proved to be the most accurate.  

It is written as follows,

&lt;math&gt;J_M=\frac{f}{2} = J_H = \frac{h}{c_p\, G}\,{Pr}^{\frac{2}{3}}= J_D = \frac{k'_c}{\overline{v}} \cdot {Sc}^{\frac{2}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation permits the prediction of an unknown transfer coefficient when one of the other coefficients is known. The analogy is valid for fully developed [[turbulent flow]] in conduits with ''[[Reynolds number|Re]]'' &gt; 10000, 0.7 &lt; ''[[Prandtl number|Pr]]'' &lt; 160, and tubes where ''L''/''d'' &gt; 60 (the same constraints as the [[Nusselt number|Sieder–Tate correlation]]). The wider range of data can be correlated by Friend–Metzner analogy.

Relationship between Heat and Mass;

&lt;math&gt;J_M = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Sh}{Re\, Sc^{\frac{1}{3}}} = J_H = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Nu}{Re\, Pr^{\frac{1}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6414">The '''Coalition for Green Capital''' (CGC) is a 501c3 non-profit that works with governments at the international, national, state and local level to establish [[Green bank|Green Bank]] finance institutions to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technology. CGC has designed and created clean energy financing institutions, or “Green Banks.” In the US, Green Banks have collectively sparked over $2 billion in clean energy investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coalitionforgreencapital.com/2017/02/24/us-green-bank-transactions-exceed-2-billion-mark/|title=US Green Bank Transactions Exceed $2 Billion Mark {{!}} Coalition for Green Capital|website=www.coalitionforgreencapital.com|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The Coalition for Green Capital’s mission is to accelerate the transition to the clean energy economy by establishing Green Banks at the local, state, federal, and international levels to spur greater private investment in renewables, energy efficiency, and clean transportation.

== Activities/Services ==
CGC partners with governments throughout the U.S. and abroad to design and launch Green Banks tailored to the specific needs of each market. Through partnerships with existing Green Banks and research, CGC investigates and develops new ways that Green Banks can grow clean energy markets. CGC also works with policymakers, industry associations, and other key stakeholders to share information about the Green Bank concept, and what Green Banks have already achieved. As a non-profit, CGC is primarily funded by many of the leading [[climate and energy]] focused-foundations in the nation.

==History==
The Coalition for Green Capital (CGC) was created as an outgrowth of [[Reed Hundt]] and Kenneth Berlin’s efforts with the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama-Biden Transition Team]] to promote financing for clean energy and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://change.gov/learn/obama_biden_transition_agency_review_teams|title=Obama-Biden Transition: Agency Review Teams {{!}} Change.gov: The Obama-Biden Transition Team|website=change.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; CGC has since become the nation’s leading expert on [[Green bank|Green Bank]] institution creation and financing.

The CGC was created coming off of the Obama-Biden Transition Team in 2009, and initially focused on advocating for a federal-level Green Bank. The Green Bank concept supported by the CGC was included in the [[Waxman-Markey Bill|Waxman-Markey]] climate change bill that passed the US House of Representatives in 2009. However, climate change legislation was unable to pass the Senate, and the CGC turned its attention to creating a state-level Green Bank.

The CGC helped newly elected Governor [[Dannel Malloy]] (working closely with his newly appointed Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, [[Daniel C. Esty|Dan Esty]]) re-purpose the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund to create the nation’s first Green Bank. The Connecticut Green Bank has since demonstrated the power of the Green Bank model, using limited public funds to attract over $491.2m of private investment in the Connecticut clean energy economy from 2012-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctgreenbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Connecticut-Green-Bank-2015-CAFR.pdf|title=Connecticut Green Bank Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|last=CT Department of Finance and Administration|first=|date=2015-06-30|website=CT Green Bank|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, and based on Connecticut’s success, interest in the Green Bank concept has grown significantly. CGC now works in over a dozen states that are at some state of Green Bank development or consideration. CGC continues to work at the federal level, supporting the introduce of the Green Bank Acts of 2014 and 2016. And CGC now works increasingly at the international level, particularly with the formation of the Global Green Bank Network.

== Recent Work ==
CGC lists its on-going work on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coalitionforgreencapital.com/state-local-activity/|title=State &amp; Local Activity Coalition for Green CapitalCoalition for Green Capital|website=coalitionforgreencapital.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green Bank Act of 2016 ===
CGC provided technical support for the Green Bank Act of 2016, which was introduced in the House by Congressman [[Chris Van Hollen]] (D-MD) on July 14, 2016 with seven co-sponsors. CGC also provided technical support for the companion legislation that was introduced in the Senate by Senators [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (D-CT), [[Richard Blumenthal]] (D-CT) and [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI) on September 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-whitehouse-introduce-green-bank-act-to-support-clean-energy-initiatives_-|title=MURPHY, BLUMENTHAL, WHITEHOUSE INTRODUCE GREEN BANK ACT TO SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY INITIATIVES    {{!}} U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut|website=www.murphy.senate.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Montgomery County, Maryland ===
CGC has played an extensive role in the creation of the Montgomery County Green Bank&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DEP/Energy/green-bank.html|title=Green Bank {{!}} Department of Environmental Protection, Montgomery County, MD|website=www.montgomerycountymd.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MCGB), the first local green bank in the country. CGC provided technical guidance in drafting legislation in line with the County’s needs, worked with County staff to manage the working group process, and is helping stand up and operationalize the new green bank.

=== Green Bank Network ===
CGC and NRDC, along with six founding green bank members, launched the Green Bank Network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenbanknetwork.org/|title=Green Bank Network|website=greenbanknetwork.org|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (GBN) in December 2015. Since then, CGC and NRDC been building the organization. At a White House-sponsored side event of the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) in May 2016, the GBN announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding among founding members agreeing to principles and mission of the GBN.

[[File:Cob wall mud construction.jpg|upright|thumb|Building a wall out of cob.]]
'''Cob''',  '''cobb''' or '''clom''' (in Wales) is a [[natural building]] material made from [[subsoil]], water, fibrous [[organic material]] (typically [[straw]]), and sometimes [[Lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph. "COB(B, sb3. 1.", ''The English Dialect Dictionary, Being the Complete Vocabulary of All Dialect Words Still in Use, or Known to Have Been in Use during the Last Two Hundred Years''. London: H. Frowde;, 1898. 676-677. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of subsoil naturally vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture it can be modified with sand or clay. Cob is fireproof, resistant to seismic activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodnow|first=Cecelia|title=Thinking of building a cob home?|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Thinking-of-building-a-cob-home-1251753.php|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inexpensive.  It can be used to create artistic, sculptural forms, and its use has been revived in recent years by the natural building and [[sustainability]] movements.

In technical building and engineering documents such as the [[Uniform Building Code]], cob may be referred to as an "unburned clay masonry" when used in a structural context. It might also be referred to as an "aggregate" in non-structural contexts, such as a "clay and sand aggregate" or more simply an "organic aggregate," such as where the cob is an insulating filler between [[Timber framing|post and beam]] construction.

==History and usage==
[[File:Cob stitch copy.jpg|thumb|'Cob stitch' repair on old traditional cob cottage in [[Devon]], England]]
''Cob'' is an English term attested to around the year 1600&lt;ref&gt;"cob, n2. 1." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009.

Cob structures can be found in a variety of climates across the globe. European examples include:

* in England, notably in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in the [[West Country]], and in [[East Anglia]] (where it is referred to as ''clay lump'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouwens|first1=Dirk|title=Earth Buildings and Their Repair|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com|website=www.buildingconservation.com|publisher=Cathedral Publications Ltd.|accessdate=13 January 2017}} ''[reproduced from The Building Conservation Directory, 1997]''&lt;/ref&gt;

* in [[Finistère|Finisterre]] in [[Brittany]], where many homes have survived over 500 years and are still inhabited{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Many old cob buildings can be found in [[Africa]], the Middle East, and many parts of the southwestern United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} A number of cob cottages survive from mid-19th-century New Zealand.&lt;ref name=NZHPT&gt;Dozens of cob cottages are [http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/SearchResults.aspx?s=s&amp;NameOrID=cob listed on the Register] of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, e.g. {{cite web|title=Ferrymead Cob Cottage|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=3101|work=Rarangi Taonga: the Register of Historic Places, Historic Areas, Wahi Tapu and Wahi Tapu Areas|publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust Pouhere Taonga|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, English cob was made by mixing the clay-based subsoil with sand, straw and water using [[oxen]] to trample it. English soils contain varying amounts of [[chalk]], and cob made with significant amounts of chalk are called ''chalk cob'' or ''[[wychert]]''. The earthen mixture was then ladled onto a stone [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] in [[Course (architecture)|courses]] and trodden onto the wall by workers in a process known as ''cobbing''. The construction would progress according to the time required for the prior course to dry. After drying, the walls would be trimmed and the next course built, with lintels for later openings such as doors and windows being placed as the wall takes shape.&lt;ref name="SnellCallahan2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Snell |last2=Tim |first2=Callahan |title=Building Green: A Complete How-to Guide to Alternative Building Methods : Earth Plaster, Straw Bale, Cordwood, Cob, Living Roofs |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gGEbRyok6f0C&amp;pg=PA276 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-1-60059-534-9 |pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of a cob house are generally about {{convert|24|in|cm}} thick, and windows were correspondingly deep-set, giving the homes a characteristic internal appearance. The thick walls provided excellent thermal mass which was easy to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. Walls with a high thermal mass value act as a thermal buffer inside the home.&lt;ref&gt;

The material has a long life-span even in rainy and/or humid climates, provided a tall foundation and large roof overhang are present.

Cob is fireproof, while "fire cob" (cob without straw or fiber) is a refractory material (the same material, essentially, as unfired common red brick), and historically, has been used to make chimneys, fireplaces, forges and crucibles. Without fiber, however, cob loses most of its tensile strength.

==Modern cob buildings==

[[File:Beautifying cob oven.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorating a cob oven]]When Kevin McCabe constructed a two-story, four bedroom cob house in [[England]], [[UK]] in 1994, it was reputedly the first cob residence built in the country in 70 years. His techniques remained very traditional; the only innovations he made were using a [[tractor]] to mix the cob and adding sand or shillet, a gravel of crushed [[shale]], to reduce shrinkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:The Cob House - Cadhay.jpg|thumb|left|A modern cob house near [[Ottery St Mary]], [[United Kingdom]]]] From 2002 to 2004, sustainability enthusiast [[Rob Hopkins]] initiated the construction of a cob house for his family, the first new one in [[Ireland]] in circa one hundred years. It was a community project, but an unidentified [[arsonist]] destroyed it shortly before completion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transitionculture.org/about/ Practical Sustainability: About]&lt;/ref&gt; The house, located at The Hollies Centre for Practical Sustainability in [[County Cork]], was being rebuilt as of 2010. There are a number of other completed modern cob houses and more are planned, including a public education centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Welcome to The Hollies |url=http://thehollies.ie |title=The Hollies |publisher=thehollies.ie |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000-01, a modern, four bedroom cob house in [[Worcestershire]], [[England]], [[UK]], designed by Associated Architects, was sold for [[Pound sterling|£]]999,000. Cobtun House was erected in 2001 and won the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Sustainable Building of the Year award in 2005. The total construction cost was £300,000, but the metre-thick outer cob wall cost only £20,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the Pacific Northwest of the [[United States]] there has been a resurgence of cob construction, both as an alternative building practice and one desired for its form, function, and cost effectiveness. Pat Hennebery, Tracy Calvert, Elke Cole, and the Cobworks workshops erected more than ten cob houses in the Southern [[Gulf Islands]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2010, Sota Construction Services in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] completed construction on its new 7,500 square foot corporate headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017204416/http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured exterior cob walls along with other energy saving features like radiant heat flooring, a rooftop solar panel array, and [[daylighting]]. The cob walls, in conjunction with the other sustainable features, enabled the edifice to earn a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum rating in 2012, and it also received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any LEED category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/projects/sota-construction-office-expansion&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ann and Gord Baird began constructing a two-storey cob house in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] for an estimated $210,000 CDN.  The home of 2,150 square feet includes heated floors, solar panels, and a southern exposure to enable [[passive solar heating]].&lt;ref name="Indy2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/a-dream-home-made-of-mud/article1079750/|title=A Dream Home Made of Mud|last=Barton|first=Adriana|date=3 August 2007|work=|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|via=|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh architect [[Ianto Evans]] and researcher Linda Smiley refined the construction technique known as "Oregon Cob" in the 1980s and 1990s. Oregon Cob integrates the variation of wall layup technique which uses loaves of mud mixed with sand and straw with a rounded architectural stylism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/history.html The History of Cob]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/17/kemery.html Building with Oregon Cob]&lt;/ref&gt; They are experimenting with a mixture of cob and straw bale denominated "[[balecob]]".

'''Compactrons''' are a type of [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]], or vacuum tube, which contain multiple electrode structures packed into a single enclosure. They were designed to compete with early transistor electronics and were used in [[television]]s, [[radio]]s, and similar roles.

== History ==
The '''Compactron''' was a trade name applied to multi-electrode structure tubes specifically constructed on a 12-pin Duodecar base. This [[vacuum tube]] family was introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicdesign.com/4g/multi-function-compactrons-promise-two-tube-radio |title=Multi-Function Compactrons Promise Two-Tube Radio |publisher=Electronic Design |page=74 |date=July 20, 1960 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/CompactronTubesIndex.shtml  |title=Compactron Tubes: A Junkbox Guide |publisher=Copperwood Media LLC. |first=Jeff |last=Duntemann |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television]] sets were a primary application. The idea of multi-electrode tubes itself was far from new and indeed the Loewe company of Germany was producing multi-electrode tubes as far back as 1926, and they even included all of the required passive components as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric [[Porta-Color]], was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons. Even before the compactron design was unveiled, nearly all tube based electronic equipment used multi-electrode tubes of one type or another. Virtually every AM/FM radio receiver of the 1950's and 60's used a 6AK8 (EABC80) tube (or equivalent) consisting of three diodes and a triode which was designed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-type.org/exhib/abc0014.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Compactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche.

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Duodekar.JPG|thumb|right|The evacuation tip is in the center of the circular pin pattern.]]
A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with "miniature" tubes, and a characteristic 3/4" diameter circle pin pattern.
* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1{{fraction|1|8}}" to 2{{fraction|3|4}}" depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms.

== Examples ==
Examples of Compactrons type types include:
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6ag11.html 6AG11] double diode similar to 6AL5, double triode high-mu similar to [[12AT7]]. Designed for FM stereo multiplex service. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6bk11.html 6BK11] triple triode. Two of the triodes are simmilar to 12AX7 and one of them is simmilar to 5751.

*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_38hk7.html 38HK7] pentode diode. Designed for horizontal output service and as a damper diode
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_1ad2.html 1AD2] diode high voltage, used in flyback transformer rectification

Due to their specific applications in television circuits, many different Compactron types were produced. Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.

== Technological obsolescence ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2016}}Integrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. "Hybrid" television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. [[New old stock]] replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.

[[File:Desert Dusk.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Landers, California]] at astronomical dusk, 20 second exposure.]]

'''Dusk''' occurs at the darkest stage of [[twilight]], or at the very end of astronomical twilight after [[sunset]] and just before [[night]].&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''The Random House College Dictionary'', "dusk".&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-dusk, during early to intermediate stages of twilight, there may be enough [[diffuse sky radiation|light in the sky]] under clear conditions to read outdoors without artificial [[Lighting|illumination]], but at the end of [[Twilight#Civil twilight|civil twilight]], when [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] to a point at which the center of the [[Sun]] is 6° below the local [[horizon]], artificial illumination is required to read outside.&lt;ref name="USNOTwilightDefs"&gt;[[U.S. Naval Observatory]]. [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''dusk'' usually refers to '''astronomical dusk''', or the darkest part of twilight before night begins.

== Technical definitions ==
[[File:Twilight subcategories.svg|thumb|Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight.&lt;ref name="Low precision formulae"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1979ApJS...41..391V|last=Van Flandern|first=T.|author2=K.

The time of dusk is the moment at the very end of astronomical twilight, just before the minimum brightness of the [[night sky]] sets in, or may be thought of as ''the darkest part of evening twilight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full definition of Dusk|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dusk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But technically, the three stages of dusk are as follows.
*At '''civil dusk''', the center of the Sun's disc goes 6° below the horizon in the evening. It marks the end of civil twilight, which begins at sunset. At this time objects are still distinguishable and depending on weather conditions some stars and planets may start to become visible to the naked eye. The sky has many colors at this time, such as orange and red. Beyond this point artificial light may be needed to carry out outdoor activities, depending on atmospheric conditions and location.
*At '''nautical dusk''', the Sun apparently moves to 12° below the horizon in the evening. It marks the end of nautical twilight, which begins at civil dusk. At this time, objects are less distinguishable, and stars and planets appear to brighten. 
*At '''astronomical dusk''', the Sun's position is 18° below the horizon in the evening. It marks the end of astronomical twilight, which begins at nautical dusk. After this time the Sun no longer illuminates the sky, and thus no longer interferes with astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="USNOTwilightDefs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/dusk.html|title=Dusk – Definition and Meaning|author=|date=|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Movement for Efficient Energy''' (EME²) is a stakeholder platform that seek to promote efficiency in the [[energy sector]] as a means to achieve overall [[Efficient energy use|energy]] and resource efficiency in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=EME21&gt;EME². [http://eme2.eu/why-eme.aspx Why EME²?] Retrieved 23 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean producing and delivering more [[energy]] for final consumption from less primary energy and other [[natural resources]], notably [[water]] and land.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; This is EME² refers to as "[[efficient energy use|efficient energy]]”.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; The current primary focus or their campaign is on the supply of more resource-efficient [[electricity]] and [[combined heat and power]].&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt;

== Background ==
The global energy system has enormous potential to make energy savings. [[GE Energy]] estimates that from a total primary energy input for electricity production of 49,555 TWh, only 15,623 TWh of electricity was delivered to customers worldwide.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1&gt;EurActiv 2011. [http://www.euractiv.com/energy-efficiency/efficient-energy-making-savings-source-linksdossier-507038 Efficient energy: Making savings at source]. Retrieved 23 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Union]] level, the energy sector consumes 30% of primary energy consumption and an analysis by Delta Energy and Environment of the [[France]], [[Poland]] and the [[UK]] shows that increases supply-side efficiency has the same overall energy saving potential as demand-side efficiency.&lt;ref name=DeltaReportSep&gt;Delta Energy and Environment September 2011. [http://eme2.eu/policy-centre/reports.aspx Driving a Resource efficiency power generation sector in Europe]. Retrieved 23 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeltaReportMay&gt;Delta Energy and Environment 19 May 2011. [http://www.delta-ee.com/downloads/2011/Delta%20Final%20Report%20-%20Driving%20a%20Resource%20Efficient%20Power%20Generation%20Sector%20in%20Europe.pdf Driving a Resource Efficiency Power  Generation Sector in Europe]. Retrieved 23 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]], [[Poland]] and the [[UK]], Delta estimates that supply-side options can contribute up to 32% of the overall goal of a 20% carbon emission reduction and up to 26% of an overall goal to reduce [[primary energy consumption]] by 20%.&lt;ref name=DeltaReportSep/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeltaReportMay/&gt;

EME² argues that ensuring supply-side [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] requires system-wide cohesion and investment, from the supply and conversion of primary energy through to the transmission and distribution of power and heat.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt;  The movement places no emphasis on a specific energy source and argues that Europe will continue to rely on a broad mix of [[energy sources]] and innovative technologies over the coming decades.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; Such a mix would evolve and vary from region to region and country to country for both political and practical reasons.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; EME² define's its purpose as to "help drive understanding and uptake of policy strategies and technologies for maximising supply-side, system-wide efficiencies whatever the mix".&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt;

The concept of efficient energy goes beyond just reducing [[greenhouse gases]]; it is about the efficient use of our resources, our [[fuel]], [[water]] and [[land (economics)|land]].&lt;ref name=EER1&gt;European Energy Review 15/04/2011. [http://www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php?id=2905 Europe’s energy future is not only about energy efficiency, it’s also about ‘Efficient Energy’]. Retrieved 27 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is about developing a more resource efficient energy production and delivery system in Europe.&lt;ref name=EER1/&gt;

== EU policy today ==
[[European Union|EU]] policy-makers have given significant attention has been given to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] amongst energy consumers.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; Policies addressing to this 'end-use' energy efficiency including encouraging the renovation and increased insulation of buildings, promoting [[European Union energy label|energy label]]s for electrical appliances and phasing out high-energy light bulbs.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; EME² argues more attention should now be paid to supply-side energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt;

The [[European Commission]] has begun to address these issues.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; In its Energy Efficiency Plan (March 2011), the European Commission called on [[EU member states]] to expand the scope of their energy efficiency policies beyond the demand side to the supply side, i.e. energy production and delivery.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; Specifically the plan calls for the increaseduse of energy production from [[co-generation]] and [[combined heat and power]] systems to help Europe achieve its energy goals.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; The Commission is further looking to strengthen the basis for [[wikt:national grid|national grid]] regulators consider energy efficiency issues in their decisions and in monitoring the management and operation of [[gas]] and [[electricity grid]]s and markets.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt;

In September 2011, the [[European Commission]] also released a Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe.&lt;ref name=ECRER&gt;European Commission 20/09/2011. [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/pdf/com2011_571.pdf Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe]. Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That roadmap described the economic benefits of using resources more efficiently, by creating major economic opportunities for companies and workers, improving productivity, reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; A key and potentially most controversial plank of the Commission proposal is to shift [[taxation]] from [[Labor (economics)|labour]] to resource use.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; It seeks to address market prices that do not reflect the true costs of using resources and their environmental impacts, by removing Environmentally Harmful Subsidies (EHS).&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; The roadmap also suggests turning waste into a key resource with the aim of decreasing the [[European Union|EU]]'s dependency on imports of [[raw materials]], lower impacts on the [[Natural environment|environment]] and open up new markets.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; The roadmap sets a 2020 target for all key resources – [[ecosystem services]], [[biodiversity]], minerals and [[metals]], [[water]], [[air]], [[land (economics)|land]] and [[soil]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] resources – and lists a series of actions and initiatives the [[European Union|EU]] and its member states should embark on.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt;

== Membership and Funding ==
EME² is funded by participants contributions with initial funding from [[GE Energy]].&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; EME² has appointed [[Burson-Marsteller]] Brussels to act as the secretariat of the movement.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; Its members include:

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary ethics''' is a field of inquiry that explores how evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of [[ethics]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology." ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Available online at: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of issues investigated by evolutionary ethics is quite broad. Supporters of evolutionary ethics have claimed that it has important implications in the fields of [[descriptive ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[metaethics]].

Descriptive evolutionary ethics consists of biological approaches to morality based on the alleged role of [[evolution]] in shaping human [[psychology]] and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[sociobiology]], or [[ethology]], and seek to explain certain human moral behaviors, capacities, and tendencies in evolutionary terms. For example, the nearly universal belief that incest is morally wrong might be explained as an evolutionary adaptation that furthered human survival.

Normative (or prescriptive) evolutionary ethics, by contrast, seeks not to explain moral behavior, but to justify or debunk certain normative ethical theories or claims. For instance, some proponents of normative evolutionary ethics have argued that evolutionary theory undermines certain widely held views of humans' moral superiority over other animals.

Evolutionary metaethics asks how evolutionary theory bears on theories of ethical discourse, the question of whether objective moral values exist, and the possibility of objective moral knowledge. For example, some evolutionary ethicists have appealed to evolutionary theory to defend various forms of moral anti-realism (the claim, roughly, that objective moral facts do not exist) and moral skepticism.

==History==
The first notable attempt to explore links between evolution and ethics was made by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871). In Chapters IV and V of that work Darwin set out to explain the origin of human morality in order to show that there was no absolute gap between man and animals. Darwin sought to show how a refined moral sense, or conscience, could have developed through a natural evolutionary process that began with social instincts rooted in our nature as social animals.

Not long after the publication of Darwin's ''The Descent of Man'', evolutionary ethics took a very different—and far more dubious—turn in the form of [[Social Darwinism]]. Leading Social Darwinists such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]] sought to apply the lessons of biological evolution to social and political life. Just as in nature, they claimed, progress occurs through a ruthless process of competitive struggle and "survival of the fittest," so human progress will occur only if government allows unrestricted business competition and makes no effort to protect the "weak" or "unfit" by means of social welfare laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bassham, ''The Philosophy Book: From the Vedas to the New Atheists, 250 Milestones in the History of Philosophy''. New York: Sterling, 2015, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]] roundly criticized such attempts to draw ethical and political lessons from Darwinism, and by the early decades of the twentieth century Social Darwinism was widely viewed as discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'', rev. ed. Boston: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of evolutionary ethics owes much to E. O. Wilson's 1975 book, ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''. In that work, Wilson argues that there is a genetic basis for a wide variety of human and nonhuman social behaviors. In recent decades, evolutionary ethics has become a lively topic of debate in both scientific and philosophical circles.

==Descriptive evolutionary ethics==
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
The most widely accepted form of evolutionary ethics is descriptive evolutionary ethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics seeks to explain various kinds of moral phenomena wholly or partly in genetic terms. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, an innate sense of fairness, a capacity for normative guidance, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, incest-avoidance, parental care, in-group loyalty, monogamy, feelings related to competitiveness and [[Retributive justice|retribution]], moral "cheating," and [[hypocrisy]].

A key issue in evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved, in both humans and nonhumans, when the process of natural selection is based on the multiplication over time only of those genes that adapt better to changes in the environment of the species. Theories addressing this have included [[kin selection]], [[group selection]], and [[reciprocal altruism]] (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). Descriptive evolutionary ethicists have also debated whether various types of moral phenomena should be seen as adaptations which have evolved because of their direct adaptive benefits, or spin-offs that evolved as side-effects of adaptive behaviors.

==Normative evolutionary ethics==
Normative evolutionary ethics is the most controversial branch of evolutionary ethics. Normative evolutionary ethics aims at defining which acts are right or wrong, and which things are good or bad, in evolutionary terms. It is not merely ''describing'', but it is ''prescribing'' goals, values and obligations. [[Social Darwinism]], discussed above, is the most historically influential version of normative evolutionary ethics. As philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] famously argued, many early versions of normative evolutionary ethics seemed to commit a logical mistake that Moore dubbed the ''naturalistic fallacy''. This was the mistake of defining a normative property, such as goodness, in terms of some non-normative, naturalistic property, such as pleasure or survival.

More sophisticated forms of normative evolutionary ethics need not commit either the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. But all varieties of normative evolutionary ethics face the difficult challenge of explaining how evolutionary facts can have normative authority for rational agents. "Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able?"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary metaethics ==
Evolutionary theory may not be able to tell us what is morally right or wrong, but it might be able to illuminate our use of moral language, or to cast doubt on the existence of objective moral facts or the possibility of moral knowledge. Evolutionary ethicists such as [[Michael Ruse]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], and [[Sharon Street]] have defended such claims.

Some philosophers who support evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine views of human well-being that rely upon Aristotelian [[teleology]], or other goal-directed accounts of human flourishing. A number of thinkers have appealed to evolutionary theory in an attempt to debunk [[moral realism]] or support moral skepticism. Sharon Street is one prominent ethicist who argues that evolutionary psychology undercuts moral realism. According to Street, human moral decision-making is "thoroughly saturated" with evolutionary influences. Natural selection, she argues, would have rewarded moral dispositions that increased fitness, not ones that track moral truths, should they exist. It would be a remarkable and unlikely coincidence if "morally blind" ethical traits aimed solely at survival and reproduction aligned closely with independent moral truths. So we cannot be confident that our moral beliefs accurately track objective moral truth. Consequently, realism forces us to embrace moral skepticism. Such skepticism, Street claims, is implausible. So we should reject realism and instead embrace some antirealist view that allows for rationally justified moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Street, "A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value." ''Philosophical Studies'', 127: 109-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral realism have offered two sorts of replies. One is to deny that evolved moral responses would likely diverge sharply from moral truth. According to David Copp, for example, evolution would favor moral responses that promote social peace, harmony, and cooperation. But such qualities are precisely those that lie at the core of any plausible theory of objective moral truth. So Street's alleged "dilemma"—deny evolution or embrace moral skepticism—is a false choice.&lt;ref&gt;David Copp, "Darwinian Skepticism about Moral Realism." ''Philosophical Issues'', 18: 186-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second response to Street is to deny that morality is as "saturated" with evolutionary influences as Street claims. William Fitzpatrick, for instance, argues that "[e]ven if there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variability of moral codes, both across cultures and historical time periods, is difficult to explain if morality is as pervasively shaped by genetic factors as Street claims.

Another common argument evolutionary ethicists use to debunk moral realism is to claim that the success of evolutionary psychology in explaining human ethical responses makes the notion of moral truth "explanatorily superfluous." If we can fully explain, for example, why parents naturally love and care for their children in purely evolutionary terms, there is no need to invoke any "spooky" realist moral truths to do any explanatory work. Thus, for reasons of theoretical simplicity we should not posit the existence of such truths and, instead, should explain the widely held belief in objective moral truth as "an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes in order to get us to cooperate with one another (so that our genes survive)."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, "The Evolution of Ethics." ''New Scientist'', 102: 1478 (17 October 1985): 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here again the central question is whether the influence of evolution on morality is as pervasive as the critics of moral realism claim. If, as seems likely, there are important aspects of morality that cannot be explained in genetic terms, appeals to moral truth may not be explanatory fifth-wheels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33202">In [[ecology]], '''extinction debt''' is the future [[extinction]] of [[species]] due to events in the past. The phrases '''dead clade walking''' and '''survival without recovery''' express the same idea.&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;

Extinction debt occurs because of time delays between impacts on a species, such as destruction of [[habitat]], and the species' ultimate disappearance. For instance, long-lived [[trees]] may survive for many years even after reproduction of new trees has become impossible, and thus they may be committed to extinction.  Technically, extinction debt generally refers to the ''number of species'' in an area likely to become extinct, rather than the prospects of any one species, but [[colloquially]] it refers to any occurrence of delayed extinction.

Extinction debt may be local or global, but most examples are local as these are easier to observe and model. It is most likely to be found in long-lived species and species with very specific habitat requirements (specialists).&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt; Extinction debt has important implications for conservation, as it implies that species may become extinct due to past habitat destruction, even if continued impacts cease, and that current reserves may not be sufficient to maintain the species that occupy them. Interventions such as habitat restoration may reverse extinction debt.

''Immigration credit'' is the corollary to extinction debt. It refers to the number of species likely to immigrate to an area after an event such as the [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration of an ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Jackson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = S.

==Terminology==
The term ''extinction debt'' was first used in 1994 in a paper by [[David Tilman]], [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[Clarence Lehman]] and [[Martin Nowak]],&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R.

Extinction debt is also known by the terms ''dead clade walking'' and ''survival without recovery''&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt; when referring to the species affected. The phrase "dead clade walking" was coined by [[David Jablonski]] as early as 2001&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=David |title=Lessons from the past: Evolutionary impacts of mass extinctions |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=2001 |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5393–5398 |doi=10.1073/pnas.101092598 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5393.full/ |pmid=11344284 |pmc=33224}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]'',&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jablonski | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Survival without recovery after mass extinctions | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/12/8139 | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 8139–8144 | doi=10.1073/pnas.102163299 | pmid=12060760 | pmc=123034}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film whose title is based on American [[prison slang]] for a condemned prisoner's last walk to the execution chamber. "Dead clade walking" has since appeared in other scientists' writings about the aftermaths of mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Popular phrases like ‘Lazarus taxon’, ‘Elvis taxon’, and ‘dead clade walking’ were first coined for gastropods ...": {{cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=Recovery of gastropods in the Early Triassic |author=Nützel, A. |journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol |volume=4 |pages=501–515 |doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2005.02.007 |issue=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussions of [[Conservation biology#Threats to biodiversity|threats to biodiversity]], extinction debt is analogous to the "[[climate commitment]]" in [[climate change]], which states that [[inertia]] will cause the earth to continue to warm for centuries even if no more [[greenhouse gasses]] are emitted. Similarly, the [[Holocene extinction|current extinction]] may continue long after [[Human impacts on the environment|human impacts]] on species halt.

== Causes ==
Jablonski recognized at least four patterns in the fossil record following mass extinctions:&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;
;(1) survival without recovery: also called “''dead clade walking''” – a group dwindling to extinction or relegation to precarious, minor ecological niches
;(2) continuity with setbacks: patterns disturbed by the extinction event but soon continuing on the previous trajectory
;(3) unbroken continuity: large-scale patterns continuing with little disruption
;(4) unbridled diversification: an increase in diversity and species richness, as in the mammals following the [[end-Cretaceous extinction event]]

Extinction debt is caused by many of the same drivers as [[extinction]]. The most well-known drivers of extinction debt are [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[habitat destruction]].&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuussaari | first1 = M. | last2 = Bommarco | first2 = R. | last3 = Heikkinen | first3 = R. K. | last4 = Helm | first4 = A. | last5 = Krauss | first5 = J. | last6 = Lindborg | first6 = R. | last7 = Öckinger | first7 = E. | last8 = Pärtel | first8 = M. | last9 = Pino | first9 = J. | last10 = Rodà | first10 = F. | last11 = Stefanescu | first11 = C. | last12 = Teder | first12 = T. | last13 = Zobel | first13 = M. | last14 = Steffan-Dewenter | first14 = I. | title = Extinction debt: a challenge for biodiversity conservation | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2009.04.011 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 564–71 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19665254| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cause extinction debt by reducing the ability of species to persist via immigration to new habitats. Under [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions, species may become extinct in one [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patch]], yet continues to survive because it can [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to other patches. However, as other patches have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible due to fragmentation, this "insurance" effect is reduced and the species may ultimately become extinct.

[[Pollution]] may also cause extinction debt by reducing a species' [[birth rate]] or increasing its [[death rate]] so that its population slowly declines.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; Extinction debts may be caused by [[invasive species]]&lt;ref name=Sax2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D. F. | last2 = Gaines | first2 = S.

Extinction debt may also occur due to the loss of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] species. In New Zealand, the local extinction of several species of pollinating birds in 1870 has caused a long-term reduction in the reproduction of the shrub species ''[[Rhabdothamnus solandri]]'', which requires these birds to produce seeds. However, as the plant is slow-growing and long-lived, its populations persist.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Kelly | first2 = D. | last3 = Ladley | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Molloy | first4 = S. | last5 = Terry | first5 = J. | title = Cascading Effects of Bird Functional Extinction Reduce Pollination and Plant Density | doi = 10.1126/science.1199092 | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6020 | pages = 1068–1071 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21292938| pmc = |bibcode = 2011Sci...331.1068A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jablonski found that the extinction rate of marine [[invertebrate]]s was significantly higher in the [[Geologic timescale|stage]] (major subdivision of an [[Geologic timescale|epoch]] &amp;ndash; typically 2&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;million years' duration) following a mass extinction than in the stages preceding the mass extinction. His analysis focused on marine [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s since they constitute the most abundant group of fossils and are therefore the least likely to produce [[sampling error]]s. Jablonski suggested that two possible explanations deserved further study:
* Post-extinction physical environments differed from pre-extinction environments in ways which were disadvantageous to the "dead clades walking".
* [[Ecosystem]]s that developed after recoveries from mass extinctions may have been less favorable for the "dead clades walking".&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002" /&gt;

== Time scale ==
The time to "payoff" of extinction debt can be very long. Islands that lost habitat at the end of the last [[ice age]] 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago still appear to be losing species as a result.&lt;ref name=Diamond1972 /&gt; It has been shown that some [[bryozoa]]ns, a type of microscopic marine organism, became extinct due to the [[volcano|volcanic]] rise of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. This event cut off the flow of nutrients from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean]] 3–4.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. While bryozoan populations dropped severely at this time, extinction of these species took another 1–2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=Jackson2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Dea | first1 = A. | last2 = Jackson | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.0844 | title = Environmental change drove macroevolution in cupuladriid bryozoans | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 276 | issue = 1673 | pages = 3629–34 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19640882| pmc = 2817302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction debts incurred due to human actions have shorter timescales. Local extinction of birds from rainforest fragmentation occurs over years or decades,&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000 /&gt; while plants in fragmented grasslands show debts lasting 50–100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004/&gt; Tree species in fragmented temperate forests have debts lasting 200 years or more.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006 /&gt;

== Theoretical development ==
===Origins in metapopulation models===
Tilman et al. demonstrated that extinction debt could occur using a mathematical [[ecosystem model]]  of species [[metapopulations]]. [[Metapopulations]] are multiple populations of a species that live in separate [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patches]] or islands but interact via immigration between the patches.  In this model, species persist via a balance between random local extinctions in patches and [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]] of new patches.  Tilman ''et al.'' used this model to predict that species would persist long after they no longer had sufficient habitat to support them. When used to estimate extinction debts of tropical tree species, the model predicted debts lasting 50–400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Tilman1994 /&gt;

One of the assumptions underlying the original extinction debt model was a trade-off between species' [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] ability and colonization ability. That is, a species that competes well against other species, and is more likely to become dominant in an area, is less likely to colonize new habitats due to evolutionary trade-offs. One of the implications of this assumption is that better competitors, which may even be more common than other species, are more likely to become extinct than rarer, less competitive, better dispersing species.  This has been one of the more controversial components of the model, as there is little evidence for this trade-off in many ecosystems, and in many empirical studies dominant competitors were least likely species to become extinct.&lt;ref name=McCarthy1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Lindenmayer | first2 = D. B. | last3 = Drechsler | first3 = M. |trans-title = Extinction Debts and Risks Faced by Abundant Species |title=Deudas de Extincion y Riesgos Enfrentados por un Numero Abundante de Especies | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.95381.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 11 | pages = 221–226 | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later modification of the model showed that these trade-off assumptions may be relaxed, but need to exist partially, in order for the theory to work.&lt;ref name=Banks1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Banks | first1 = J. E. | title = Do Imperfect Trade-Offs Affect the Extinction Debt Phenomenon? | journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 1597–1601| year = 1997 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1597:DITOAT]2.0.CO;2 | issn = 0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development in other models===
Further theoretical work has shown that extinction debt can occur under many different circumstances, driven by different mechanisms and under different model assumptions. The original model predicted extinction debt as a result of habitat destruction in a system of small, isolated habitats such as islands. Later models showed that extinction debt could occur in systems where habitat destruction occurs in small areas within a large area of habitat, as in [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture in forests, and could also occur due to decreased growth of species from pollutants.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loehle | first1 = C. | last2 = Li | first2 = B. L. | title = Habitat Destruction and the Extinction Debt Revisited | doi = 10.2307/2269483 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–789 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2269483 | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc667129/ | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predicted patterns of extinction debt differ between models, though. For instance, habitat destruction resembling slash-and-burn agriculture is thought to affect rare species rather than poor colonizers. Models that incorporate [[Stochastic process|stochasticity]], or random fluctuation in populations, show extinction debt occurring over different time scales than classic models.&lt;ref name=Etienne2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Etienne | first1 = R. | last2 = Nagelkerke | first2 = C. | title = Non-equilibria in Small Metapopulations: Comparing the Deterministic Levins Model with its Stochastic Counterpart | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3135 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 219 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12425979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, extinction debts have been estimated through the use models derived from [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]]. Neutral theory has very different assumptions than the metapopulation models described above. It predicts that the abundance and distribution of species can be predicted entirely through random processes, without considering the traits of individual species. As extinction debt arises in models under such different assumptions, it is robust to different kinds of models. Models derived from neutral theory have successfully predicted extinction times for a number of bird species, but perform poorly at both very small and very large spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Halley2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Halley | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Iwasa | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011217108 | title = Neutral theory as a predictor of avifaunal extinctions after habitat loss | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 2316–21 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21262797| pmc = 3038702|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.2316H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical model]]s have also shown that extinction debt will last longer if it occurs in response to large habitat impacts (as the system will move farther from equilibrium), and if species are long-lived. Also, species just below their [[extinction threshold]], that is, just below the population level or habitat occupancy levels required sustain their population, will have long-term extinction debts. Finally, extinction debts are predicted to last longer in landscapes with a few large patches of habitat, rather than many small ones.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002 /&gt;

== Detection ==
Extinction debt is difficult to detect and measure. Processes that drive extinction debt are inherently slow and highly variable (noisy), and it is difficult to locate or count the very small populations of near-extinct species. Because of these issues, most measures of extinction debt have a great deal of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt;

===Experimental evidence===
Due to the logistical and ethical difficulties of inciting extinction debt, there are few studies of extinction debt in controlled experiments. However, experiments [[Microcosm: Model / experimental ecosystem|microcosms]] of [[insects]] living on moss habitats demonstrated that extinction debt occurs after habitat destruction. In these experiments, it took 6–12&amp;nbsp;months for species to die out following the destruction of habitat.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00171.x | title = Community relaxation in fragmented landscapes: the relation between species richness, area and age | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–448 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational methods===
====Long-term observation====
Extinction debts that reach equilibrium in relatively short time scales (years to decades) can be observed via measuring the change in species numbers in the time following an impact on habitat. For instance, in the [[Amazon rainforest]], researchers have measured the rate at which bird species disappear after forest is cut down.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = P. C. | last2 = Strong | first2 = C. | last3 = Naka | first3 = L. N. | title = Twenty years of understorey bird extinctions from Amazonian rain forest fragments: consistent trends and landscape-mediated dynamics | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00497.x | journal = Diversity and Distributions | volume = 15 | pages = 88–97 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As even short-term extinction debts can take years to decades to reach equilibrium, though, such studies take many years and good data are rare.

====Comparing the past and present====
Most studies of extinction debt compare species numbers with habitat patterns from the past and habitat patterns in the present. If the present populations of species are more closely related to past habitat patterns than present, extinction debt is a likely explanation. The magnitude of extinction debt (i.e., number of species likely to become extinct) can not be estimated by this method.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

If one has information on species populations from the past in addition to the present, the magnitude of extinction debt can be estimated. One can use the relationship between species and habitat from the past to predict the number of species expected in the present. The difference between this estimate and the actual number of species is the extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

This method requires the assumption that in the past species and their habitat were in equilibrium, which is often unknown.   Also, a common relationship used to equate habitat and species number is the [[species-area curve]], but as the species-area curve arises from very different mechanisms than those in [[metapopulation]] based models, extinction debts measured in this way may not conform with metapopulation models' predictions.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; The relationship between habitat and species number can also be represented by much more complex models that simulate the behavior of many species independently.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vellend | first1 = M. | last2 = Verheyen | first2 = K. | last3 = Jacquemyn | first3 = H. | last4 = Kolb | first4 = A. | last5 = Van Calster | first5 = H. | last6 = Peterken | first6 = G. | last7 = Hermy | first7 = M. | doi = 10.1890/05-1182 | title = Extinction Debt of Forest Plants Persists for More Than a Century Following Habitat Fragmentation | journal = Ecology | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 542–8 | year = 2006 | pmid =  
16602283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparing impacted and pristine habitats====
If data on past species numbers or habitat are not available, species debt can also be estimated by comparing two different habitats: one which is mostly intact, and another which has had areas cleared and is smaller and more fragmented.  One can then measure the relationship of species with the condition of habitat in the intact habitat, and, assuming this represents equilibrium, use it to predict the number of species in the cleared habitat.  If this prediction is lower than the actual number of species in the cleared habitat, then the difference represents extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;  This method requires many of the same assumptions as methods comparing the past and present.

=== Examples ===

==== Grasslands ====
Studies of European grasslands show evidence of extinction debt through both comparisons with the past and between present-day systems with different levels of human impacts. The species diversity of [[grasslands]] in [[Sweden]] appears to be a remnant of more connected landscapes present 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lindborg | first1 = R. | last2 = Eriksson | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1890/04-0367 | title = Historical Landscape Connectivity Affects Present Plant Species Diversity | journal = Ecology | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 1840 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Alvar|alvar grasslands]] in [[Estonia]] that have lost area since the 1930s, 17–70% of species are estimated to be committed to extinction.&lt;ref name=Helm2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Helm | first1 = A. | last2 = Hanski | first2 = I. | last3 = Partel | first3 = M. | title = Slow response of plant species richness to habitat loss and fragmentation | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00841.x | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 0 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–7 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16958870| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of similar grasslands in [[Belgium]], where similar impacts have occurred, show no evidence of extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Adriaens2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adriaens | first1 = D. | last2 = Honnay | first2 = O. | last3 = Hermy | first3 = M. | title = No evidence of a plant extinction debt in highly fragmented calcareous grasslands in Belgium | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.06.006 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 212 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due to differences in the scale of measurement or the level of specialization of grass species.&lt;ref name=Cousins2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.009 | last1 = Cousins | first1 = S.

O. | last2 = Vanhoenacker | first2 = D. | title = Detection of extinction debt depends on scale and specialisation | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 144 | issue = 2 | pages = 782 | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forests ====
Forests in [[Vlaams-Brabant]], Belgium, show evidence of extinction debt remaining from [[deforestation]] that occurred between 1775 and 1900. Detailed modeling of species behavior, based on similar forests in [[England]] that did not experience deforestation, showed that long-lived and slow-growing species were more common than equilibrium models would predict, indicating that their presence was due to lingering extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006/&gt;

In Sweden, some species of [[lichens]] show an extinction debt in fragments of ancient forest. However, species of lichens that are habitat [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists, rather than specialists]], do not.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berglund | first1 = H. | last2 = Jonsson | first2 = B.

==== Insects ====
Extinction debt has been found among species of [[butterflies]] living in the grasslands on [[Saaremaa]] and [[Muhu]] – islands off the western coast of Estonia. Butterfly species distributions on these islands are better explained by the habitat in the past than current habitats.&lt;ref name=Sang2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sang | first1 = A. | last2 = Teder | first2 = T. | last3 = Helm | first3 = A. | last4 = Pärtel | first4 = M. | title = Indirect evidence for an extinction debt of grassland butterflies half century after habitat loss | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.015 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 143 | issue = 6 | pages = 1405 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the islands of the [[Azores]] [[Archipelago]], more than 95% of native forests have been destroyed in the past 600&amp;nbsp;years. As a result, more than half of [[arthropods]] on these islands are believed to be committed to extinction, with many islands likely to lose more than 90% of species.&lt;ref name=Kostas2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Triantis | first1 = K.

==== Vertebrates ====
80–90% of extinction from past [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] has yet to occur, based on modeling based on species-area relationships. Local extinctions of approximately 6&amp;nbsp;species are expected in each 2500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region by 2050 due to past deforestation.&lt;ref name=Wearn2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wearn | first1 = O. R. | last2 = Reuman | first2 = D. C. | last3 = Ewers | first3 = R. M. | doi = 10.1126/science.1219013 | title = Extinction Debt and Windows of Conservation Opportunity in the Brazilian Amazon | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6091 | pages = 228 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22798612| pmc = |bibcode = 2012Sci...337..228W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds in the [[Amazon rain forest]] continued to become extinct locally for 12&amp;nbsp;years following logging that broke up [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] forest into smaller fragments. The extinction rate slowed, however, as forest regrew in the spaces in between habitat fragments.&lt;ref name="Stouffer2009"/&gt;

Countries in [[Africa]] are estimated to have, on average, a local extinction debt of 30% for forest-dwelling [[primates]].  That is, they are expected to have 30% of their forest primate species to become extinct in the future due to loss of forest [[habitat]]. The time scale for these extinctions has not been estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowlishaw | first1 = G. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98433.x | title = Predicting the Pattern of Decline of African Primate Diversity: an Extinction Debt from Historical Deforestation | journal = [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–1193 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historical species-area relationships, [[Hungary]] currently has approximately nine more species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]] than are thought to be able to be supported by current nature reserves.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldi | first1 = A. | last2 = Voros | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.baae.2005.09.005 | title = Extinction debt of Hungarian reserves: A historical perspective | journal = Basic and Applied Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 289 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to conservation==
The existence of extinction debt in many different ecosystems has important implications for [[conservation biology|conservation]].   It implies that in the absence of further habitat destruction or other environmental impacts, many species are still likely to become extinct. Protection of existing [[habitats]] may not be sufficient to protect species from extinction.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006/&gt; However, the long time scales of extinction debt may allow for habitat [[restoration ecology|restoration]] in order to prevent extinction,&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt; as occurred in the slowing of extinction in Amazon forest birds above.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009 /&gt; In another example, it has been found that [[grizzly bears]] in very small reserves in the [[Rocky Mountains]] are likely to become extinct, but this finding allows the modification of reserve networks to better support their populations.&lt;ref name=Carroll2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = C. | last2 = Noss | first2 = R. F. | last3 = Paquet | first3 = P. C. | last4 = Schumaker | first4 = N. H. | title = Extinction Debt of Protected Areas in Developing Landscapes | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00083.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 1110 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extinction debt concept may require revision of the value of land for species conservation, as the number of species currently present in a habitat may not be a good measure of the habitat's ability to support species (see [[carrying capacity]]) in the future.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005 /&gt; As extinction debt may last longest near extinction thresholds, it may be hardest to detect the threat of extinction for species that conservation could benefit the most.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanski | first1 = I. | last2 = Ovaskainen | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00342.x | title = Extinction Debt at Extinction Threshold | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 666 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic analyses have shown that including extinction in management decision-making process changes decision outcomes, as the decision to destroy habitat changes conservation value in the future as well as the present. It is estimated that in [[Costa Rica]], ongoing extinction debt may cost between $88 million and $467 million.&lt;ref name=Leroux2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leroux | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Martin | first2 = V. L. | last3 = Goeschl | first3 = T. | title = Optimal conservation, extinction debt, and the augmented quasi-option value☆ | doi = 10.1016/j.jeem.2008.10.002 | journal = Journal of Environmental Economics and Management | volume = 58 | pages = 43–57 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forests in Lithuania''' cover approximately 33% of [[Lithuania]]′s territory. Of these, about 50% are publicly owned, and 30% are privately owned; the remainder is reserved for possible future privatization. The dominant species are [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris'') (42%) and [[spruce]] (''Picea abies'') (22.8%). The average age of the forest stands is 53 years. The largest forest is [[Dainava Forest]] at 1,350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[power system automation]], the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] 60870 standards define systems used for telecontrol ([[supervisory control and data acquisition]]). Such systems are used for controlling electric power transmission grids and other geographically widespread control systems. By use of standardized protocols, equipment from many different suppliers can be made to interoperate. IEC standard 60870 has six parts, defining general information related to the standard, operating conditions, electrical interfaces, performance requirements, and data transmission protocols. The 60870 standards are developed by [[IEC TC 57|IEC Technical Committee 57]] (Working Group 03).

== IEC 60870-5 ==
{{Main|IEC 60870-5}}
IEC 60870 part 5, known as '''Transmission protocols''', &lt;ref name=Clarke04&gt;Gordon R. Clarke et al, ''Practical modern SCADA protocols: DNP3, 60870.5 and related systems'',Newnes, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7506-5799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The IEC TC 57 WG3 have developed a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for [[electric power]] systems. The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:
* IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
* IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
* IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
* IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
* IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions
* IEC 60870-5-6 Guidelines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion standards
* IEC TS 60870-5-7 Security extensions to IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 protocols (applying IEC 62351)

The IEC TC 57 has also generated companion standards:
* IEC 60870-5-101 Transmission Protocols - companion standards especially for basic telecontrol tasks
* IEC 60870-5-102 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the transmission of integrated totals in electric power systems (this standard is not widely used)
* IEC 60870-5-103 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the informative interface of protection equipment
* IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101 using standard transport profiles
* IEC TS 60870-5-601 Transmission protocols - Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-101 companion standard
* IEC TS 60870-5-604 Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard

IEC 60870-5-101/102/103/104 are companion standards generated for basic telecontrol tasks, transmission of integrated totals, data exchange from protection equipment &amp; network access of IEC101 respectively.

== IEC 60870-6 ==
{{Main|IEC 60870-6}}
IEC TC 57 WG3 also generated standards for telecontrol protocols compatible with ISO standards and ITU-T recommendations. These standards include:
* IEC 60870-6-1 Application context and organization of standards
* IEC 60870-6-2 Use of basic standards (OSI layers 1–4)
* IEC 60870-6-501 TASE.1 Service definitions
* IEC 60870-6-502 TASE.1 Protocol definitions
* IEC 60870-6-503 TASE.2 Services and protocol
* IEC 60870-6-504 TASE.1 User conventions
* IEC TR 60870-6-505 TASE.2 User guide
* IEC 60870-6-601 Functional profile for providing the connection-oriented transport service in an end system connected via permanent access to a packet switched data network
* IEC 60870-6-602 TASE transport profiles
* IEC 60870-6-701 Functional profile for providing the TASE.1 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-702 Functional profile for providing the TASE.2 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-802 TASE.2 Object models

An '''intermittent energy source''' is any source of [[energy]] that is not continuously available for conversion into [[electricity]] and outside direct control because the used [[primary energy]] cannot be stored. Intermittent energy sources may be predictable but cannot be [[dispatchable generation|dispatched]] to meet the demand of an electric power system.

The use of intermittent sources in an electric power system usually displaces storable primary energy that would otherwise be consumed by other [[power station]]s. Another option is to store electricity generated by non-dispatchable energy sources for later use when needed, e.g. in the form of [[pumped storage]], [[Compressed air energy storage|compressed air]] or in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. A third option is the [[sector coupling]] e.g. by electric heating for district heating schemes.

The use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on [[Electrical grid|grid]] operations. Using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure.&lt;ref name='All_Island_Grid_Overview'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/E20F6E3D-8724-4E39-B315-0670B8C9841E/0/AllIslandGridStudyStudyOverviewJan08a2.pdf |title=All Island Grid Study |accessdate=2008-10-15 |date=January 2008 |pages=3–5, 15 |format=PDF |work=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231419/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/E20F6E3D-8724-4E39-B315-0670B8C9841E/0/AllIslandGridStudyStudyOverviewJan08a2.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CarbonDTI'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensg.gov.uk/assets/ct_impact_of_re_final_report.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100919181607/http://www.ensg.gov.uk/assets/ct_impact_of_re_final_report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-19 |title=The Carbon Trust &amp; DTI Renewables Network Impacts Study |accessdate=2009-04-22 |date = January 2004 |orig-year=commissioned June 2003 |format=PDF |work=Carbon Trust and UK Department of Trade and Industry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
&lt;!-- [[Nameplate capacity]] redirects here. Please update the redirect if you change the section heading title. --&gt;
Several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources. These terms are not standardized, and variations may be used. Most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants.

* '''Intermittency''' can mean the extent to which a power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable, but intermittency is frequently used as synonym of '''variability''',&lt;ref name=GrahamSinden&gt;Graham Sinden, "[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/05/050705TPASindenpres.pdf Assessing the Costs of Intermittent Power Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231439/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/05/050705TPASindenpres.pdf |date=2009-03-18 }}", UK Energy Research Centre, 5 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEFlowBattery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/oct05/features/rerere/rerere.html |title=renewable. rechargeable. remarkable. |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Kuntz |first=Mark T. |author2=Justin Dawe |year=2005 |work=VRB Power Systems |publisher=Mechanical Engineering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212122/http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/oct05/features/rerere/rerere.html |archivedate=2009-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the extent to which a power source may exhibit changes in output.&lt;ref name="GrahamSinden"/&gt;
* '''[[Dispatchable generation|Dispatchability]]''' or '''maneuverability''' is the ability of a given power source to increase and decrease output quickly on demand. The concept is distinct from intermittency; dispatchability is one of several ways system operators match supply (generator's output) to system demand (technical loads).&lt;ref name="MEFlowBattery"/&gt;
* '''Penetration''' in this context is generally used to refer to the amount of energy generated as a percentage of annual consumption.&lt;ref name="ieawind.org"&gt;[http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Publications/Task25/Task%2025%20Design%20and%20Operation%20of%20Power%20Systems%20UWIG.pdf International Energy Agency Wind Task Force, "Design and Operation of Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power"] Oklahoma Conference Presentation, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nominal power''' or '''[[nameplate capacity]]''' refers to the maximum output of a generating plant in normal operating conditions. This is the most common number used and typically expressed in multiplies of [[Watt]].
* '''[[Capacity factor]]''', '''average capacity factor''', or '''load factor''' is the average expected output of a generator, usually over an annual period. Expressed as a percentage of the nameplate capacity or in decimal form (e.g. 30% or 0.30).
* '''[[Capacity credit]]''': generally the amount of output from a power source that may be statistically relied upon, practically the minimum power within a longer period, usually expressed as a percentage of the nominal power.&lt;ref name='WindCC'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejournal.windeng.net/3/01/GGiebel-CapCredLit_WindEngEJournal_2005_right_links.pdf |title=WIND POWER HAS A CAPACITY CREDIT |accessdate=2008-10-16 |last=Giebel |first=Gregor |format=PDF |work=Risø National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Firm capacity''' the amount of power that can be guaranteed to be provided as [[base power]]
* '''Non-firm capacity''' the amount of power above the firm capacity that is usually to be sold at higher price on the [[spot market]]

==Intermittency of various power sources==

===Solar energy===
{{See also|Solar power}}
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Dish Stirling]]]]

Intermittency inherently affects solar energy, as the production of renewable electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of sunlight at a given place and time.  Solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons, and is affected by dust, fog, cloud cover, frost or snow.  Many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/2011/10/25/gemasolar_energia_non_stop.html Gemasolar, energía non stop] Spanish 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Intermittency:''' In the absence of an [[energy storage system]], solar does not produce power at night or in bad weather and varies between summer and winter. When intended to produce electricity only for peak [[air conditioning]] loads in the summer, there is no intermittency; in the winter can be complemented with wind power for peak loads.
* '''Capacity factor''' Photovoltaic solar in Massachusetts 12–15%.&lt;ref name="RERLWind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |title=Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn't blow? |accessdate=2008-10-16 |format=PDF |work=Renewable Energy Research Laboratory, University of Massachusetts Amherst |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205145/http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Photovoltaic solar in Arizona 19%.&lt;ref name='THSolarVsWind'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/03/solar-versus-wind-power.php |title=Solar Versus Wind Power: Which Has The Most Stable Power Output? |accessdate=2008-10-16 |last=Laumer |first=John |date = June 2008|work=Treehugger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal [[solar parabolic trough]] with storage 56%.&lt;ref name='NRELSolar'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35060.pdf |title=Executive Summary: Assessment of Parabolic Trough and Power Tower Solar Technology Cost and Performance Forecasts |accessdate=2016-11-07 |date = October 2003|format=PDF |work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal [[solar power tower]] with storage 73%.&lt;ref name="NRELSolar"/&gt;

The impact of intermittency of solar-generated electricity will depend on the correlation of generation with demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as [[Nevada Solar One]] are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant]] can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36SolarP.pdf Spain Pioneers Grid-Connected Solar-Tower Thermal Power] p. 3.

===Wind energy===

[[File:Wind Generation Percentage Bar Chart U.S. 2011.svg|thumb|right|Over the entire year more than 20 percent of South Dakota's electricity is generated from wind power.]]

Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics (among other factors). If wind speed is too low (less than about 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s) then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high (more than about 25&amp;nbsp;m/s) the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage.  While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable.&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=connect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer2007/&gt;&lt;ref name = Diesendorf&gt;{{cite journal| author = Diesendorf, Mark |year= 2007| title =Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy|page =119| quote =Graham Sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom. He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200&amp;nbsp;km to 0.25 at 600&amp;nbsp;km separation (a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0). There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom, and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year.|title-link= Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Intermittence:''' Regions smaller than [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] (the size of an average country) have mostly the same weather and thus around the same wind power, unless local conditions favor special winds. Some studies show that wind farms spread over a geographically diverse area will as a whole rarely stop producing power altogether.&lt;ref name=connect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer2007/&gt; However this is rarely the case for smaller areas with uniform geography such as Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c26/page_187.shtml |title=Sustainable Energy - without the hot air.

* '''[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]]:''' A wind farm has high technical reliability when the wind blows. That is, the output at any given time will only vary gradually due to falling wind speeds or storms (the latter necessitating shut downs). A typical wind farm is unlikely to have to shut down in less than half an hour at the extreme, whereas an equivalent sized power station can fail totally instantaneously and without warning. The total shut down of wind turbines is predictable via weather forecasting. The average availability of a wind turbine is 98%, and when a turbine fails or is shutdown for maintenance it only affects a small percentage of the output of a large wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iset.uni-kassel.de/abt/FB-I/publication/2006-02-09Reliability.pdf Reliability of Wind Turbines]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Wind power forecasting|Predictability]]:''' Although wind is variable, it is also predictable in the short term. There is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in an hour and a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5&amp;nbsp;hours.

Wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power.  As a result, wind power is affected seasonally (more output in winter than summer) and by daily temperature variations.

===Nuclear power===
Several authors have said that no energy resource is totally reliable. [[Amory Lovins]] says that nuclear power plants are [[intermittent power source|intermittent]] in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly, often for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=al2009&gt;{{cite web|first=Amory |last=Lovins |author2=Imran Sheikh |author3=Alex Markevich |date=2009 |url=http://www.rmi.org/rmi/Library/E09-01_NuclearPowerClimateFixOrFolly |title=Nuclear Power:Climate Fix or Folly |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain Institute]] |page=10 |quote=All sources of electricity sometimes fail, differing only in how predictably, why, how often, how much, and for how long.

The remaining U.S. nuclear plants produce approximately 90% of their full-time full-load potential, but even they must shut down (on average) for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt; To cope with such intermittence by nuclear (and centralized fossil-fuelled) power plants, utilities install a "reserve margin" of roughly 15% extra capacity spinning ready for instant use.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt;

The intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources can be reduced and accommodated by diversifying their technology type and geographical location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables (such as hydropower, geothermal, and biomass). Combining this with energy storage and demand response can create a power system that can reliably match real-time energy demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Saleh|first=M.|last2=Esa|first2=Y.|last3=Mhandi|first3=Y.|last4=Brandauer|first4=W.|last5=Mohamed|first5=A.|date=October 2016|title=Design and implementation of CCNY DC microgrid testbed|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7731870/metrics|journal=2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting|pages=1–7|doi=10.1109/IAS.2016.7731870|isbn=978-1-4799-8397-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integration of ever-higher levels of renewables has already been successfully demonstrated:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Saleh|first=M.

In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids". In fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the [[International Energy Agency]], has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A research group at Harvard University quantified the meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the Central US:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem with the output from a single wind farm located in any particular region is that it is variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system. The high frequency (shorter than once per day) variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer. The low frequency variability (longer than once per day) is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days. The high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the Central US. More than 95% of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day, allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind.&lt;ref&gt;name="Junling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Junling Huang |author2=Michael B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mark A. Delucchi and Mark Z. Jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand:&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System andTransmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z.

{{ordered list|list-style-type= upper-alpha
| Interconnect geographically dispersed, technologically diverse renewable generation types (such as wind, solar, and tidal) to smooth out daily supply variability. For example, solar power generation is highest at midday, and wind is often strongest at night and early morning. The combined solar-wind resource has lower variance than either individual source.
| Use dispatchable renewable energy generators (such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass) to fill energy deficits between demand and intermittent resource generation.
| Use demand response (or demand-side management) to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available, and away from times when renewable generation is low. This requires that loads be capable of receiving and responding to price or control signals from the local utility or grid operator.
| Store excess renewable power, which would otherwise be curtailed, for later use at times when generation is not sufficient to meet load. Some energy storage technology types include pumped hydro, electrochemical batteries, flywheels, compressed air, and hydrogen. These energy storage resources can be located near intermittent generation, “behind the meter” at homes and business, or at any other point on the electric grid. Customer-sited storage is typically used to increase self-consumption of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic panels, to shift grid power consumption towards off-peak hours, and to reduce demand charges. Grid-scale storage is typically used to provide ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation, synchronous “spinning” reserve capacity, and load-following.
| Over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand, and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses.
| Use electric vehicles as an additional storage resource. The first generation of this technology, known as V1G (unidirectional managed charging), involves “smart charging” at times when the grid can accommodate additional load, with power only flowing into the vehicle. A further development, known as V2B (vehicle-to-building), sees bidirectional power flow into the vehicle at optimal times, and out of the vehicle to meet building demand. The most advanced form, known as V2G ([[Vehicle-to-grid]]), sees power exported from the EV back on to the grid when needed.

Technological solutions to mitigate large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection (the [[European super grid]]), [[Demand response]], [[load management]], [[diesel generators]] (in the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|British National Grid]], Frequency Response / [[National Grid Reserve Service]] type schemes, and use of existing power stations on standby.

Matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources. Existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures. Though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems, significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power.   The [[International Energy Agency| International Energy Agency (IEA)]] states:
"In the case of wind power, operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met. Again, it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid. Wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability. However, these factors are nothing completely new to system operators. By adding another variable, wind power changes the degree of uncertainty, but not the kind..."&lt;ref name='IEA2005WindVar'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/Papers/2005/variability.pdf |title=Variability of Wind Power and other Renewables: Management Options and Strategies |accessdate=2008-10-15 |work=IEA |year=2005 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With sufficient energy storage, highly variable and intermittent sources can supply all of a regions electrical power. For solar to provide half of all electricity and using a solar capacity factor of 20%, the total capacity for solar would be 250% of the grids average daily load. For wind to provide half of all electricity and using a wind capacity factor of 30% the total capacity for wind would be 160% of the grids average daily load.

A pumped storage facility would then store enough water for the grids weekly load, with a capacity for peak demand i.e.:200% of the grid average. This would allow for one week of overcast and windless conditions. There are unusual costs associated with building storage and total generating capacity being six times the grid average.

==Compensating for variability==
{{See also|Electric power transmission}}

All sources of electrical power have some degree of variability, as do demand patterns which routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid. Wherever possible, grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability, and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed. The introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments.

The capacity of a reliable [[renewable energy|renewable power]] supply, can be fulfilled by the use of [[Redundancy (engineering)|backup or extra infrastructure and technology]], using mixed renewables to produce electricity [[Fault-tolerant design|above the intermittent average]], which may be used to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/print/article/2011/02/solar-solar-and-energy-storage-a-perfect-match|title=Solar and Energy Storage: A Perfect Match - Energy Storage to the Test|publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com|accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies can be part of a [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] power supply.

===Operational reserve===
{{See also|National Grid Reserve Service}}

All managed grids already have existing operational and "spinning" reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid. The addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100% "back-up" because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis, and not dedicated to a specific generating plant.

* Some coal, gas, or hydro power  plants are partially loaded and then controlled to change as demand changes or to replace rapidly lost generation. The ability to change as demand changes is termed "response."  The ability to quickly replace lost generation, typically within timescales of 30&amp;nbsp;seconds to 30&amp;nbsp;minutes, is termed "spinning reserve."
* Generally thermal plants running as [[Peaking power plant|peaking plants]] will be less efficient than if they were running as [[Base load power plant|base load]].
* Hydroelectric facilities with storage capacity (such as the traditional dam configuration) may be operated as base load or peaking plants.
* In practice, as the power output from wind varies, partially loaded conventional plants, which are already present to provide response and reserve, adjust their output to compensate.
* While low penetrations of intermittent power may use existing levels of response and spinning reserve, the larger overall variations at higher penetrations levels will require additional reserves or other means of compensation.

===Demand reduction or increase===
* [[Demand response]] refers to the use of communication and switching devices which can release deferrable loads quickly, or absorb additional energy to correct supply/demand imbalances. Incentives have been widely  created in the American, British and French systems for the use of these systems, such as favorable rates or capital cost assistance, encouraging consumers with large loads to take them off line or to start diesels whenever there is a shortage of capacity, or conversely to increase load when there is a surplus.
* Certain types of load control allow the power company to turn loads off remotely if insufficient power is available. In France large users such as CERN cut power usage as required by the System Operator - EDF under the encouragement of the EJP tariff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/how-cern-is-encouraged-to-not-do-atom-or-quark-smashing-during-periods-of-high-demand-and-low-power-station-availablity-by-means-of-the-ejp-tarrif.html - Extract from CERN newsletter indication when to switch of loads&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/ description of EJP tariff {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208120416/http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/ |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Energy demand management]] refers to incentives to adjust use of electricity, such as higher rates during peak hours.
* Real-time variable electricity pricing can encourage users to adjust usage to take advantage of periods when power is cheaply available and avoid periods when it is more scarce and expensive.&lt;ref name=CaliPolicy&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005_energypolicy/index.html| title=2005 Integrated Energy Policy Report| date=November 21, 2005| publisher=California Energy Commission| accessdate=2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instantaneous demand reduction.  Most large systems also have a category of loads which instantly disconnect when there is a generation shortage, under some mutually beneficial contract.  This can give instant load reductions (or increases).  See [[National Grid Reserve Service]]
* Diesel generators, originally or primarily installed for emergency power supply are often also connected to the National Grid in the UK to help deal with short term demand supply mismatches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/commercial-opportunities-for-back-up-generation-and-load-reduction-via-national-grid-the-national-electricity-transmission-system-operator-netso-for-england-scotland-wales-and-offshore.html Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage and demand loading===
{{Main|Grid energy storage}}

At times of low load where non-dispatchable output from wind and solar may be high, grid stability requires lowering the output of various dispatchable generating sources or even increasing controllable loads, possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand. Such mechanisms can include:

* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|Pumped storage hydropower]] is the most prevalent existing technology used, and can substantially improve the economics of wind power. The availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid.  Typical round trip efficiency is 80%.&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;&lt;ref name='REPAWindEconomics'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/rep/wpaper/2006-02.html |title=The Economics of Wind Power with Energy Storage |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Benitez |first=Pablo C. |author2=Lilianna E. Dragulescu |author3=G. Cornelis Van Kooten  |date = February 2006|work=Resource Economics and Policy Analysis (REPA) Research Group |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thermal energy storage]] stores heat. Stored heat can be used directly for heating needs or converted into electricity. In the context of a CHP plant a heat storage can serve as a functional electricity storage at comparably low costs. 
* [[Ice storage air conditioning]] Ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand. Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed.
* [[Hydrogen]] can be created through [[electrolysis]] and stored for later use.  [[NREL]] found that a kilogram of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to a gallon of gasoline) could be produced for between US$5.55 in the near term and $2.27 in the long term.&lt;ref name='NRELElectrolysis'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39534.pdf |title=Wind Energy and Production of Hydrogen and Electricity - Opportunities for Renewable Hydrogen - Preprint |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Levene |first=J. |author2=B. Kroposki |author3=G. Sverdrup  |date = March 2006|format=PDF |work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rechargeable [[Flow battery|flow batteries]] can serve as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium.&lt;ref name="MEFlowBattery"/&gt;
* Traditional lithium-ion batteries have a large environmental footprint, but  new technologies such as air-breathing batteries could provide an enviro-friendly solution to renewable energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enviro-news.com/news/air-breathing-battery-renewable-energy-storage-solution.html|title=Air-Breathing Battery Renewable Energy Storage Solution |publisher=Enviro-News.com|date=August 3, 2012&lt;!--, 7:40AM BST--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some loads such as desalination plants, electric boilers and industrial refrigeration units, are able to store their output (water and heat). These "opportunistic loads" are able to take advantage of "burst electricity" when it is available.
* Various other potential applications are being considered, such as charging plug-in electric vehicles during periods of low demand and high production; such technologies are not widely used at this time.

Storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient. Storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities.

===Geographic diversity===
The variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, as long as the [[correlation]] between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;name="Junling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Junling Huang |author2=Michael B. McElroy |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003674|title=Meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the Central US|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=62 |pages=331–340 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations. [[Wind power forecasting|Wind output can be predicted]] with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts, especially from large numbers of turbines/farms. The ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected, especially from newer facilities.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Complementary power sources and matching demand===
In the past electrical generation was mostly dispatchable and consumer demand led how much and when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent sources such as wind, solar, and run-of-river hydro means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply. The use of intermittent sources relies on electric power grids that are carefully managed, for instance using highly dispatchable generation that is able to shut itself down whenever an intermittent source starts to generate power, and to successfully startup without warning when the intermittents stop generating.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy: [https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Maintaining%20Reliability%20in%20the%20Modern%20Power%20System.pdf Maintaining Reliability in the Modern Power System], December 2016, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally the capacity of the intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace heating fuels or be converted to [[Energy storage|mechanical or chemical storage]] for later use.

The displaced dispatchable generation could be coal, natural gas, biomass, nuclear, geothermal or storage hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is cheaper to use them as constant [[base load]] power. Any power generated in excess of demand can displace heating fuels, be converted to storage or sold to another grid. Biofuels and conventional hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. [[Fossil fuel phase-out|Alternatives to burning]] coal and natural gas which produce fewer [[greenhouse gas]]es may eventually make fossil fuels a [[stranded asset]] that is left in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plants that operate for fewer hours and lower [[capacity factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Richard: [https://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/death-capacity-factor-how-wind-solar-ultimately-win-game.html Death by 'capacity factor': Is this how wind and solar ultimately win the game?], 2015-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electricity produced from solar energy tends to counterbalance the fluctuating supplies generated from wind.  Normally it is windiest at night and during cloudy or stormy weather, and there is more sunshine on clear days with less wind.&lt;ref name='AtlanticFragility'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmi.org/images/other/EnergySecurity/S83-08_FragileDomEnergy.pdf |title=The Fragility of Domestic Energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Lovins |first=Amory |author2=L. Hunter Lovins |date = November 1983|format=PDF |work=The Atlantic |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625205941/http://www.rmi.org/images/other/EnergySecurity/S83-08_FragileDomEnergy.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, wind energy has often a peak in the winter season, whereas solar energy has a peak in the summer season; the combination of wind and solar reduces the need for dispatchable backup power.
* In some locations, electricity demand may have a high correlation with wind output, particularly in locations where cold temperatures drive electric consumption (as cold air is denser and carries more energy).
* Intermittent solar electricity generation has a direct correlation where hot sunny weather drives high cooling demands. This is an ideal relationship between intermittent energy and demand.
* The allowable penetration may be increased with further investment in standby generation. For instance some days could produce 80% intermittent wind and on the many windless days substitute 80% dispatchable power like natural gas, biomass and Hydro. 
* Areas with existing high levels of [[hydroelectric]] generation may ramp up or down to incorporate substantial amounts of wind. [[Norway]], [[Brazil]], and [[Manitoba]] all have high levels of hydroelectric generation, Quebec produces over 90% of its electricity from hydropower, and [[Hydro-Québec]] is the largest hydropower producer in the world. The U.S. Pacific Northwest has been identified as another region where wind energy is complemented well by existing hydropower, and there were "no fundamental technical barriers" to integrating up to 6,000&amp;nbsp;MW of wind capacity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001634.html "Air, Water Powerful Partners in Northwest", Washington Post, March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Storage capacity in hydropower facilities will be limited by size of reservoir, and environmental and other considerations.
* The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]], [[Germany]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power around the clock, entirely from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export &amp; import arrangements with neighboring systems===
* It is often feasible to export energy to neighboring grids at times of surplus, and import energy when needed. This practice is common in Western Europe and North America.
* Integration with other grids can lower the effective concentration of variable power. Denmark's 44% penetration, in the context of the German/Dutch/[[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Scandinavian grids]] with which it has interconnections, is considerably lower as a proportion of the total system.
* Integration of grids may decrease the overall variability of both supply and demand by increasing geographical diversity.
* Methods of compensating for power variability in one grid, such as peaking-plants or pumped-storage hydro-electricity, may be taken advantage of by importing variable power from another grid that is short on such capabilities.
* The capacity of power transmission infrastructure may have to be substantially upgraded to support export/import plans.
* Some energy is lost in transmission.
* The economic value of exporting variable power depends in part on the ability of the exporting grid to provide the importing grid with useful power at useful times for an attractive price.

==Penetration==
Penetration refers to the proportion of a [[primary energy]] (PE) source in an electric power system, expressed as a percentage.&lt;ref name="ieawind.org"/&gt; There are several methods of calculation yielding different penetrations. The penetration can be calculated either as:&lt;ref name="ukerc2006tpa"/&gt;

# the nominal capacity (installed power) of a PE source divided by the peak load within an electric power system; or
# the nominal capacity (installed power) of a PE source divided by the total capacity of the electric power system; or
# the electrical energy generated by a PE source in a given period, divided by the demand of the electric power system in this period.

The level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons:

* Power grids with significant amounts of dispatchable [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]], [[hydropower]] with [[reservoir]] or [[pondage]] or other [[peaking power plant]]s such as natural gas-fired power plants are capable of accommodating fluctuations from intermittent power more easily.&lt;ref&gt;http://repa.econ.uvic.ca/publications/Working%20Paper%202006-02.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Relatively small electric power systems without strong interconnection may only be stable and economic with a lower fraction of wind energy (e.g. Ireland), although hybrid wind/diesel and solar/diesel systems have been used in isolated communities with success at relatively high penetration levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/30668.pdf Characterizing the Effects of High Wind Penetration on a Small Isolated Grid in Arctic Alaska]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sma.de/en/newsroom/current-news/news-details/news/4297-photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid-project-with-sma-system-technology-has-gone-into-operation-in-india-4.html Photovoltaic Diesel Hybrid Project With SMA System Technology Has Gone Into Operation In India]: a project with 1,25 MVA diesel genset &amp; 1 MWp PV system, 2013-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration, as each system's capacity to compensate for intermittency differs, and the systems themselves will change over time. Discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution, as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors, grid structure and management, and existing generation capacity.

For most systems worldwide, existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums; for example, a UK study found that "it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in Britain over the next 20 years, although it may increase costs."&lt;ref name="ukerc2006tpa"&gt;{{cite book

===Maximum penetration limits===
There is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid. Rather, economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors; technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future, particularly if cost considerations are secondary.

High penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances:

* Power generation for periods of little or no wind generation can be provided by retaining the existing power stations. The cost of using existing power stations for this purpose may be low since fuel costs dominate the operating costs.  The actual cost of paying to keep a power station idle, but usable at short notice, may be estimated from published [[spark spread]]s and [[dark spread]]s. As existing traditional plant ages, the cost of replacing or refurbishing these facilities will become part of the cost of high-penetration wind if they are used only to provide operational reserve.
* Automatic load shedding of large industrial loads and its subsequent automatic reconnection is established technology and used in the UK and U.S., and known as [[National Grid Reserve Service|Frequency Service contractors]] in the UK. Several GW are switched off and on each month in the UK in this way. Reserve Service contractors offer [[Peaking power plant|fast response gas turbines]] and even faster diesels in the UK, France and U.S. to control grid stability.
* In a close-to-100% wind scenario, surplus wind power can be allowed for by increasing the levels of the existing Reserve and Frequency Service schemes and by extending the scheme to domestic-sized loads. Energy can be stored by advancing deferrable domestic loads such as storage heaters, water heaters, fridge motors, or even [[hydrogen production]], and load can be shed by turning such equipment off.
* Alternatively or additionally, power can be exported to neighboring grids and re-imported later.  HVDC cables are efficient with 3% loss per 1000&amp;nbsp;km and may be inexpensive in certain circumstances. For example, an 8 GW link from UK to France would cost about £1&amp;nbsp;billion using [[high-voltage direct current]] cables. Under such scenarios, the amount of transmission capacity required may be many times higher than currently available.

===Penetration studies===
Studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets.

====European super grid====
A series of detailed modelling studies by Dr. Gregor Czisch, which looked at the European wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the [[European super grid]] using [[HVDC]] cables, indicates that the entire European power usage could come from renewables, with 70% total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present.&lt;ref name="Czisch100Renew"/&gt;  This proposed large European power grid has been called a "[[super grid]]."&lt;ref name='DWWorldGregor'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2105061,00.html |title=Dr. Gregor Czisch's green European "Super Grid"

The model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30% and by heavy use of HVDC to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas.  The report states that "electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply" and underscores the importance of "international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use [and] transmission."&lt;ref name="Czisch100Renew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EFFECTS OF LARGE-SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF WIND

====Grid study in Ireland====
A study of the grid in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42% (of demand) renewables
in the electricity mix.&lt;ref name='IrishPR'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/2008/Study+shows+Ireland+can+be+world+leader+in+renewable+energy.htm |title=Study shows Ireland can be world leader in renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=January 2008 |work=Department of Communications, Energy and National Resources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220558/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/2008/Study%2Bshows%2BIreland%2Bcan%2Bbe%2Bworld%2Bleader%2Bin%2Brenewable%2Benergy.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called Scenario 5, provided 47% of electrical capacity (different from demand) with the following mix of renewable energies:

* 6,000 MW wind
* 360 MW base load renewables
* 285 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)

The study cautions that various assumptions were made that "may have understated dispatch restrictions, resulting in an underestimation of operational costs, required wind curtailment, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions" and that "The limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed..."

Scenario 6, which proposed renewables providing 59% of electrical capacity and 54% of demand had problems.  Scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies:

* 8,000 MW wind
* 392 MW base load renewables
* 1,685 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)

The study found that for Scenario 6, "a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met.  The results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios, a system re-design is required, rather than a reinforcement exercise."  The study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because "determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made" and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results.&lt;ref name="All_Island_Grid_Overview"/&gt;

====Canada====

====Denmark====
A November 2006 analysis, found that "wind power may be able to cover more than 50% of the Danish electricity consumption in 2025" under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowances.&lt;ref name='Danish_Wind_Env_Full'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/graphics/Publikationer/Havvindmoeller/havvindmoellebog_nov_2006_skrm.pdf |title=Danish Offshore Wind - Key Environmental Issues |accessdate=2008-10-15 |date = November 2006|format=PDF |work=DONG Energy, Vattenfall, The Danish Energy Authority and the Danish Forest and Nature Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark's two grids (covering West Denmark and East Denmark separately) each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Economic impacts of variability==
Estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the "external" costs of wind variability, or be limited to the cost of production. All electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production, including, for example, the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity. Many types of generation, particularly fossil fuel derived, will also have cost [[externality|externalities]] such as pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for. The magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location, but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels. At low penetration levels, costs such as [[operating reserve]] and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant.

Intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types. These may include:

* Transmission capacity: transmission capacity may be more expensive than for nuclear and coal generating capacity due to lower load factors. Transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output, but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower, raising cost per unit of energy actually transmitted. However transmission costs are a low fraction of total energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/what-is-the-cost-per-kwh-of-bulk-transmission-national-grid-in-the-uk-note-this-excludes-distribution-costs.html Electric power transmission costs per kWh transmission / National Grid in the UK (note this excludes distribution costs)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additional operating reserve: if additional wind does not correspond to demand patterns, additional operating reserve may be required compared to other generating types, however this does not result in higher capital costs for additional plants since this is merely existing plants running at low output - spinning reserve. Contrary to statements that all wind must be backed by an equal amount of "back-up capacity", intermittent generators contribute to base capacity "as long as there is some probability of output during peak periods." Back-up capacity is not attributed to individual generators, as back-up or operating reserve "only have meaning at the system level."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,550/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706221755/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_download/gid%2C550/ |date=2007-07-06 }} The Costs and Impacts of Intermittency, UK Energy Research Council, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing costs: to maintain grid stability, some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand. The ability of the grid to balance supply with demand will depend on the rate of change of the amount of energy produced (by wind, for example) and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or scale production down. Balancing costs have generally been found to be low.
* Storage, export and load management: at high penetrations (more than 30%),{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} solutions (described below) for dealing with high output of wind during periods of low demand may be required. These may require additional capital expenditures, or result in lower marginal income for wind producers.

===Analyses of costs===
Studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability.  [[RenewableUK]] states:

{{cquote|A review of integration studies, worldwide, suggests that the additional costs of integrating wind are around £2/MWh with 10% wind, rising to £3/MWh with 20% wind.&lt;ref name='BWEAIntegrating'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/pdf/RAEIntegrationfinal.pdf |title=Integrating renewables |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Ford |first=Richard |author2=David Milborrow |date = February 2005|format=PDF |work=British Wind Energy Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Colorado – separate reports by Xcel and UCS====
An official at [[Xcel Energy]] claimed that at 20 percent penetration, additional standby generators to compensate for wind in Colorado would cost $8 per MWh, adding between 13% and 16% to the US$50–60 cost per MWh of wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/28wind.html?pagewanted=all New York Times article on intermittency and penetration, December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in Colorado to 10% and found that for an average residential bill "customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement" would save 4 cents per month, but that for [[Xcel Energy]] customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month.  Total impact on all consumers would be $4.5 million or 0.01% over two decades.&lt;ref name='UCSColorado37PDF'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/co_ballot_res_report_-_final.pdf |title=The Colorado Renewable Energy Standard Ballot Initiative: Impacts on Jobs and the Economy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |last=Deyette |first=Jeff |author2=Steve Clemmer |date = October 2004|format=PDF |work=Union of Concerned Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='UCSColorado37Web'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/solutions/renewable_energy_solutions/the-colorado-renewable-energy.html |title=The Colorado Renewable Energy Standard Ballot Initiative: Impacts on Jobs and the Economy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |date = October 2004|work=Union of Concerned Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK studies====
A detailed study for [[UK National Grid]] (a private power company) states "We have estimated that for the case with 8,000&amp;nbsp;MW of wind needed to meet the 10% renewables target for 2010, balancing costs can be expected to increase by around £2 per MWh of wind production. This would represent an additional £40million per annum, just over 10% of existing annual balancing costs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2007/1/28/183633/609 No technical limitation to wind power penetration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NG_7YR_Summary'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/sys_06/print.asp?chap=all |title=GB Seven Year Statement - Executive Summary |accessdate=2008-10-16 |year=2006 |work=National Grid }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evidence to the UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee, National Grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40% wind and these lie in the range £500-1000M per annum.  "These balancing costs represent an additional £6 to £12 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around £390."&lt;ref name='GridToLords'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/EA273%20National%20Grid%20Response%20on%20Economics%20of%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf |title=National Grid's response to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee investigating the economics of renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |work=National Grid |date=June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115928/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/EA273%20National%20Grid%20Response%20on%20Economics%20of%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Grid notes that "increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency."&lt;ref name="NG_7YR_Summary"/&gt;

A 2003 report,&lt;ref name="CarbonDTI"/&gt; by [[Carbon Trust]] and the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)]], projected costs of £1.6 to £2.4 billion for reinforcement and new build of transmission and  distribution systems to support 10% renewable electricity in the UK by 2010, and £3.2bn to £4.5bn for 20% by 2020. The study classified "Intermittency" as "Not a significant issue" for the 2010 target but a "Significant Issue" for the 2020 target. ''See [[grid balancing]]''

====Minnesota====
A Minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that "total integration operating cost for up to 25% wind energy" would be less than $0.0045 per kWh (additional).&lt;ref name=MinnesotaFull&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwig.org/windrpt_vol%201.pdf |title=Minnesota Wind Integration Study - Full Report |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Wolf |first=Ken |author2=Matt Schuerger |date = December 2006|work=Minnesota Public Utilities Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermittency and renewable energy==
There are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency.  The [[World Nuclear Association]] argues that the sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf10.html Renewable Energy and Electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated, and that practical experience demonstrates this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, 413 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] [[renewable energy]] has, like nuclear, no intermittency (but they both use the energy in radioactive materials like uranium, thorium and potassium).

===Views of critics of high penetration renewable energy use===
For many years there was a consensus within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they will never be able to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power. Thomas Petersnik, an analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".&lt;ref name="Benjamin Sovacool 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/20526 |title=The intermittency of wind, solar, and renewable electricity generators: Technical barrier or rhetorical excuse? |author=Benjamin Sovacool |date=2009 |journal=Utilities Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on [[EROEI|Energy return on energy Invested]](EROEI), conducted by 6 analysts and led by D. Weißbach, as published in the [[peer reviewed]] journal ''Energy'' in  2013. The uncorrected for their intermittency("unbuffered") EROEI for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544213000492 |title=Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants. | doi=10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.029 | volume=52 |journal=Energy |pages=210–221|date=April 2013 |last1=Weißbach |first1=D. |last2=Ruprecht |first2=G. |last3=Huke |first3=A. |last4=Czerski |first4=K. |last5=Gottlieb |first5=S. |last6=Hussein |first6=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Dailykos]] - GETTING TO ZERO: Is renewable energy economically viable? by Keith Pickering MON JUL 08, 2013 AT 04:30 AM PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; while the buffered(corrected for their intermittency) EROEI stated in the paper for all [[low carbon power]] sources, with the exception of nuclear and biomass, were yet lower still.

===Views of proponents of high penetration renewable energy use===
{{See also|Renewable Electricity and the Grid|Energy security and renewable technology}}

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stated that "baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism" and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/a-very-significant-admission-by-the-us-ferc-chairman-that-the-issue-of-integrating-variable-sources-of-power-is-not-such-a-big-issue.html | title=Wind a very significant admission by the US FERC chairman that the issue of integrating variable sources of power is not such a big issue - Power and Reliability: The Roles of Baseload and Variable Resources &amp;#124; Claverton Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferc.gov/news/videos/wellinghoff/2009/04-22-09-wellinghoff-transcript.pdf |title=FERC: Federal Regulation and Oversight of Energy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506162616/https://www.ferc.gov/news/videos/wellinghoff/2009/04-22-09-wellinghoff-transcript.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to [[coal-fired power station]]s, so they are [[base-load]], and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up. Examples include:

* [[Bio-energy]], based on the combustion of crops and crop residues, or their gasification followed by combustion of the gas.
* [[Hot dry rock]] geothermal power, which is being developed in [[Geothermal energy exploration in Central Australia|Australia]] and the [[Geothermal energy in the United States|United States]].
* [[Solar thermal electricity]], with overnight heat storage in molten salt, water or rocks.

Grid operators in countries like Denmark and Spain now integrate large quantities of renewable energy into their electricity grids, with Denmark receiving 40% of its electricity from [[wind power]] during some months.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Sovacool 2009"/&gt;

Supporters say that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed [[wind farm]]s, located in different wind regimes, cannot be accurately described as intermittent, because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 119; See also, {{cite journal | last1 = Sinden | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Characteristics of the UK wind resource: long term patterns and relationship to electricity  demand"' | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 112–27 | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant, which operates infrequently, large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/DissentMD2006.pdf In defence of renewable energy and its variability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829114854/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/DissentMD2006.pdf |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydropower]] can be intermittent and/or dispatchable, depending on the configuration of the plant. Typical [[hydroelectric]] plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity, and be considered dispatchable. [[Run of the river]] hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity, and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis (dependent on rainfall and snow melt).&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;

[[Amory Lovins]] suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues:

{{cquote|"The variability of sun, wind and so on, turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things. One is to diversify your renewables by technology, so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another. Second, you diversify by site so they're not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they're in the same place. Third, you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind, sun and rain, and of course hydro operators do this right now. Fourth, you integrate all your resources&amp;nbsp;— supply side and demand side..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/570.html Amory Lovins/Rocky Mountain Institute warm to PHEVs]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, [[efficient energy use]] and [[energy conservation]] measures can reliably reduce demand for base-load and peak-load electricity.&lt;ref name=BaseFallacy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/sustainable-energy-has-powerful-future/2007/04/12/1175971264442.html Sustainable energy has a powerful future]&lt;/ref&gt;

International groups are studying much higher penetrations (30-[[100% renewable energy]]), and conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Meetings/Oklahoma/IEA%20SysOp%20GWPC2006%20paper_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DCFd3dj?url=http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Meetings/Oklahoma/IEA%20SysOp%20GWPC2006%20paper_final.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }} IEA Wind Summary Paper, ''Design and Operation of Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power'', September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20% of UK power consumption, then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,550/   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706221755/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_download/gid%2C550/ |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present (e.g. [[demand management]]) to potential new technologies for [[grid energy storage]]. Improved [[Wind Power Forecasting|forecasting]] can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable. The [[Pembina Institute]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] state in the [[Renewable is Doable]] plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy:

{{cquote|Diversity and dispersal also add system security. If one wind turbine fails, the lights won't flicker. If an entire windfarm gets knocked out by a storm, only 40,000 people will lose power. If a single Darlington reactor goes down, 400,000 homes, or key industries, could face instant blackouts. To hedge this extra risk, high premiums have to be paid for decades to ensure large blocks of standby generation.&lt;ref name="PEMBINAbrochure"/&gt;}}

As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R.

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and time–space compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543–553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1369">'''The inverse Faraday effect''' is the effect opposite to the [[Faraday effect]]. A static [[magnetization]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{M}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is induced by an external oscillating [[electrical field]] with the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, which can be achieved with a high intensity [[laser]] pulse for example. The induced magnetization is proportional to the vector product of &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}^*&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\vec{M}(0)\propto[\vec{E}(\omega)\times\vec{E}^*(\omega)]&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation we see that the circularly polarized light with the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; should induce a magnetization along the [[wave vector]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[vector product]], left- and right-handed [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] waves should induce magnetization of opposite signs. 

The induced magnetization is comparable to the saturated magnetization of the media.

An '''ion''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ɒ|n|,_|-|ə|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ion "Ion"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] that has a non-zero net [[electric charge|electrical charge]]. Since the charge of the electron (considered "negative" by convention) is equal and opposite to that of the proton (considered "positive" by convention), the net charge of an ion is non-zero due to its total number of [[electron]]s being unequal to its total number of [[proton]]s.  A [[cation]] is a positively charged ion, with fewer electrons than protons, while an [[anion]] is negatively charged, with more electrons than protons. Because of their opposite electric currents, cations and anions attract each other and readily form [[ionic compound]]s. 

Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or [[monatomic ion]]s, while two or more atoms form molecular ions or [[polyatomic ion]]s. In the case of physical ionization in a medium, such as a gas,  "ion pairs" are created by ion collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion.&lt;ref name = "knoll"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glenn F |last=Knoll |title=Radiation detection and measurement |edition=3rd |date=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-07338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the dissolution of a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a [[direct current]] through a conducting solution, dissolving an [[anode]] via [[ionization]].

== History of discovery ==
The word ''ion'' comes from the Greek word ἰόν, ''ion'', "going", the present participle of ἰέναι, ''ienai'', "to go". This term was introduced by English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834 for the then-unknown species that ''goes'' from one [[electrode]] to the other through an aqueous medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/faraday_michael.shtml | title=Michael Faraday (1791-1867) | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion | title=Online etymology dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode; that some kind of substance has moved through the solution in a current. This conveys matter from one place to the other.

Faraday also introduced the words ''anion'' for a negatively charged ion, and ''cation'' for a positively charged one. In Faraday's nomenclature, cations were named because they were attracted to the [[cathode]] in a galvanic device and anions were named due to their attraction to the [[anode]].

[[Svante Arrhenius]] put forth, in his 1884 dissertation, his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday's ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-231035-721|page=155|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Chicago|isbn=085-229553-7|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciBio"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-684101-122|pages=296–302|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Ions in their gas-like state are highly reactive and will rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce ''solvated ions'', which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid.  These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from dissolved salts.

As charged objects, ions are attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa) and repelled by like charges. When they move, their trajectories can be deflected by a [[magnetic field]].

Electrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [[matter waves]], determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [[electron cloud]]. Cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - ''very much smaller'' than the parent hydrogen atom.

=== Anions and cations===
[[File:Ions.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|[[Hydrogen atom]] (center) contains a single [[proton]] and a single [[electron]].  Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right).  The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the [[cation]]. Hydrogen forms the only charge-+1 cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.]]
{{redirect2|Cation|Anion|the particle physics/quantum computing concept|Anyon|other uses|Ion (disambiguation)}}
Since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.

An '''{{vanchor|anion}}''' (−) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|.|aɪ|.|ən}}), from the Greek word ἄνω (''ánō''), meaning "up",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095414154 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW anion | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ruby.colorado.edu/~smyth/G101-2.html | title =Atoms and Elements, Isotopes and Ions | author =''[[University of Colorado Boulder]]'' | publisher =colorado.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{vanchor|cation}}''' (+) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|.|aɪ|.|ən}}), from the Greek word κάτω (''káto''), meaning "down",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095555447 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW cation | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a positive charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usouthal.edu/geology/haywick/GY111/111-4.pdf | title =Elemental Chemistry | author =Douglas W. Haywick, Ph.D. | author2 =University of South Alabama | publisher =usouthal.edu | date =2007–2008| authorlink2 =University of South Alabama }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are additional names used for ions with multiple charges.  For example, an ion with a −2 charge is known as a [[dianion]] and an ion with a +2 charge is known as a [[dication]].  A [[zwitterion]] is a neutral molecule with positive and negative charges at different locations within that molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1biochem/amino2.html#zwitter | title =Amino Acids | author =''[[Purdue University]]'' | publisher =purdue.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cations and anions are measured by their [[ionic radius]] and they differ in relative size: "Cations are small, most of them less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; cm) in radius. But most anions are large, as is the most common Earth anion, [[oxygen]]. From this fact it is apparent that most of the space of a [[crystal]] is occupied by the anion and that the cations fit into the spaces between them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Press]] &amp; Raymond Siever (1986) ''Earth'', 14th edition, page 63, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]] {{ISBN|0-7167-1743-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cation has radius less than 0.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (0.8 Å) while an anion has radius greater than 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (1.3 Å).&lt;ref&gt;[[Linus Pauling]] (1960) {{Google books|L-1K9HmKmUUC&amp;PA544|Nature of the Chemical Bond|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ions are ubiquitous in [[nature]] and are responsible for diverse phenomena from the luminescence of the Sun to the existence of the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. Atoms in their ionic state may have a different colour from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the colour of [[gemstone]]s. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an example is the energy that drives breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.

== Related technology ==
Ions can be non-chemically prepared using various [[ion source]]s, usually involving high [[voltage]] or temperature.  These are used in a multitude of devices such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], [[optical emission spectrometer]]s, [[particle accelerators]], [[Ion implantation|ion implanters]], and [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].

As reactive charged particles, they are also used in [[Air ioniser|air purification]] by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [[smoke detector]]s.

As signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [[cell membrane|membrane]]s, the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death.  This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [[biocides]], including the [[ion channels]] [[gramicidin]] and [[amphotericin]] (a [[fungicide]]).

Inorganic dissolved ions are a component of [[total dissolved solids]], a widely-known indicator of [[water quality]].

===Detection of ionizing radiation===
[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.&lt;ref name = "knoll"/&gt;]]
[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]
The ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-rays]]. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an "ion pair"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [[ionization chamber]] is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.&lt;ref name = "knoll"/&gt;

The [[Geiger–Müller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] both use a phenomenon known as a [[Townsend avalanche]] to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.

=== Notation ===

====Denoting the charged state====
[[File:Ions notation.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent notations for an [[iron]] atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [[ferrous]].]]

When writing the [[chemical formula]] for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.  The net charge is written with the magnitude ''before'' the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as '''2+''' instead of '''+2'''.   However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [[sodium]] cation is indicated as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''not'' Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;.

An alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times, this is often seen with transition metals.  Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning.  All three representations of {{chem|Fe|2+}} shown in the figure, are thus equivalent.

[[File:Ions notation2.svg|thumb|Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.]]

Monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example, the {{chem|Fe|2+}} example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;.  The Roman numeral designates the ''formal [[oxidation state]]'' of an element, whereas the superscripted numerals denote the net charge.  The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals ''cannot'' be applied to polyatomic ions.  However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.

====Sub-classes====
If an ion contains [[unpaired electron]]s, it is called a ''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]'' ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive.  Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called ''[[oxyanion]]s''.   Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called ''organic ions''.  If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a ''[[carbocation]]'' (if positively charged) or ''[[carbanion]]'' (if negatively charged).

=== Formation ===
==== Formation of monatomic ions ====
Monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [[Valence electron|valence shell]] (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]], and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ''ionization''.

Atoms can be ionized by bombardment with [[radiation]], but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [[chemistry]] is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable ("closed shell") electronic configurations. Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.

For example, a [[sodium]] atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process

:Na → {{chem|Na|+}} + {{Subatomic particle|electron}}

On the other hand, a [[chlorine]] atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to ''gain'' an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:

:Cl + {{Subatomic particle|electron}} → {{chem|Cl|-}}

This driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the "extra" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [[ionic bond]]s and combine to form [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.

:{{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}} → NaCl

==== Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions ====
[[File:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png|thumb|right|An [[electric potential|electrostatic potential]] map of the [[nitrate ion]] ({{chem|NO|3|−}}). The 3-dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary [[isopotential]].]]

Polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in neutral molecules. For example, when [[ammonia]], NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, accepts a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;—a process called [[protonation]]—it forms the [[ammonium]] ion, {{chem|NH|4|+}}. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [[electron configuration|electronic configuration]], but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.

Ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion {{chem|NH|3|•+}}. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [[Valence electron|valence shell]] around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] ion.

Due to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as {{chem|H|+}}, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.

==== Ionization potential ====
{{main article|Ionization potential}}
The [[energy]] required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ''ionization potential'', or ''ionization energy''. The ''n''th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its ''n''th electron after the first ''n − 1'' electrons have already been detached.

Each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [[atomic orbital]]s is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one ''[[valence electron]]'' in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as {{chem|Na|+}}. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as {{chem|Cl|-}}. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.&lt;ref name="lenntech.com"&gt;[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/ionization-energy.htm Chemical elements listed by ionization energy]. Lenntech.com&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the ionization energy of [[metals]] is much lower than the ionization energy of [[nonmetals]], which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.

===Ionic bonding===
{{main article|Ionic bond}}

''Ionic bonding'' is a kind of [[chemical bond]]ing that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [[crystal lattice]]. The resulting compound is called an ''ionic compound'', and is said to be held together by ''ionic bonding''. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [[ionic radius]] of individual ions may be derived.

The most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [[noble gas]]es, which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as ''[[electropositivity]]''. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as ''[[electronegativity]]''. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a ''[[salt (chemistry)|salt]]''.

'''Jacques l'Hermite''' (c. 1582&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;June 2, 1624), sometimes also known as '''Jacques le Clerq''' {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[merchant]], [[explorer]] and [[admiral]] known for his journey around the globe with the [[Nassau Fleet]] (1623–1626) and for his blockade and raid on [[Callao]] in 1624 during that same voyage in which he also died. He served the [[Dutch East India Company]] as chief merchant in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] and [[Ambon Island]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The Chilean [[Hermite Islands]] near [[Cape Horn]] which his fleet charted in February 1624 are named after him.

==Personal life==
L'Hermite was born in [[Antwerp]], [[Dutch Republic]] (present-day Belgium) around the year 1582. After the [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fall of Antwerp]] in 1585 in a battle with the [[Spanish Empire]], the family moved north to [[Amsterdam]] and later settled in [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name="hunt54"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Brederode, van |first= Willem |title= Op jacht naar Spaans zilver, het scheepsjournaal van Willem van Brederode |publisher= Uitgeverij Verloren |date= 2008 |isbn= 978-90-8704-047-5 |page= |pages= 54–55|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Republic in 1606 and spent the next six years working in the Dutch East Indies.

==Professional life==
In 1606 l'Hermite set sail to the [[Dutch East Indies]] as a secretary on the fleet commanded by Admiral [[Cornelis Matelief de Jonge|Cornelis Matelief Jr.]] where in 1607 he was appointed chief merchant on the ''Black Lion'' ({{lang-nl|Swarte Leeuw}}). From 1607–1611 l'Hermite was chief merchant ({{lang-nl|opperkoopman}}) for the Dutch East India Company in Bantam, Dutch East Indies. After six years working abroad he returned to Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name="hunt54" /&gt; There he married Theodora van Wely in March 1613.&lt;ref&gt;New Dutch Biographic Dictionary, [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu05_01/molh003nieu05_01_0316.htm Hermite, Jr. Jacques l'], retrieved May 19, 2009. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1623 l'Hermite was commissioned by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau]] and the Dutch State General to lead a fleet of eleven ships known as the ''Nassau Fleet'' ({{lang-nl|Nassausche vloot}}) with its flagship ''Amsterdam''. The fleet set sail on a circumnavigational voyage westwards from Amsterdam to the western coast of [[South America]] with the objective to hunt down Spanish silver ships leaving [[Peru]] and to establish a Dutch colony in either Peru or Chile, at that time known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].&lt;ref name="Gerhard"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gerhard |first= Peter |title= Pirates of New Spain 1575–1742 |publisher= [[Courier Dover Publications]] |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-486-42611-4 |page= |pages= 123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commanded by Admiral l'Hermite, the fleet was ''de facto'' led by his Vice-Admiral [[Gheen Huygen Schapenham]] and Rear-Admiral Julius Wilhelm Van Verschoor after l'Hermite like most of its crew suffered from [[dysentery]]&lt;ref name="Trouw"&gt;''[[Trouw]]'' newspaper archive, [http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1994/10/08/2651188/HAD_HERMITE_GEWONNEN__DAN_SPRAK_PERU_NU_NEDERLANDS.html Had Hermite gewonnen, dan sprak Peru nu Nederlands], retrieved May 19, 2009. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the journey. Early 1624 the fleet passed Cape Horn through [[Lemaire Channel]] and explored and charted the Hermite Islands.&lt;ref name="Spate"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Spate |first= O.H.K. |title= Monopolists and freebooters |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date= 1983 |isbn= 0-7099-2371-6 |page= |pages= 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1624 the fleet blocked the port of Callao and raided the cities of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]] and [[Guayaquil]], but they were unsuccessful in establishing a colony and the fleet was forced to continue its voyage westwards towards the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

==Death==
L'Hermite died on June 2, 1624 during the blockade of Callao after suffering from [[dysentery]] and [[scurvy]] for months.&lt;ref name="Trouw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Lane |first= Kris E. |title= Pillaging the empire, piracy in the americas 1500–1750 |publisher= [[M.E.

The '''Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security''' (abbreviated '''CHS'''; previously the '''UPMC Center for Health Security''',&lt;ref name="jh_rename"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/JHSPH%20Partnership/JHSPH%20Partnership |author=Price Tyson |date=January 16, 2017 |title=Center for Health Security Joins Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School |publisher=Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |quote=the Center for Health Security, which had previously been affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), has joined the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Center for Biosecurity of UPMC''', and the '''Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies''') is an independent, nonprofit organization of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] that works in the area of health consequences from epidemics and disasters. It is a [[think tank]] that does policy research and gives policy recommendations to the [[United States government]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/website/about_us/ Center for Health Security] Mission Statement   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622081819/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/website/about_us/ |date=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="open_phil" /&gt;

==History==

The Center for Health Security began as the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) in 1998 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;ref name="roos" /&gt; [[D. A. Henderson]] served as the founding director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-staff/profiles/henderson/index.html |author=UPMC Center for Health Security |date=January 18, 2017 |title=D. A. Henderson |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |quote=He was Dean Emeritus and Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and a Founding Director (1998) of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Center was the first and only academic center focused on biosecurity policy and practice.

At one point around 2003, CHS had become part of a new [[umbrella organization]] called the Institute for Global Health and Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;ref name="roos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.jh.edu/~gazette/2003/22sep03/22global.html |title=Public Health forms Global Health, Security Institute |publisher=''Johns Hopkins Gazette'' |date=September 22, 2003 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |first=Tim |last=Parsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2003/global-health-security.html |author=JH Bloomberg School of Public Health |date=September 16, 2003 |title=Institute for Global Health and Security |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, the leaders left Johns Hopkins to join the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC), and relaunched the Center as the Center for Biosecurity of UPMC. This move apparently split the organization in two, and it is unclear what happened to the old organization.&lt;ref name="roos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/09/johns-hopkins-biodefense-experts-head-new-direction |first=Robert |last=Roos|publisher=CIDRAP |title=Johns Hopkins biodefense experts head in new direction |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |date=September 23, 2003 |quote=the four full-time faculty members and 16 administrative staff members of the CCBS are all leaving Hopkins to join the UPMC. 'No decision has been made exactly what to do with the Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, whether it'll have a new direction or mission incorporated into some other center,' [Tim Parsons] said. 'But its biodefense activities will be incorporated in some way into the new initiative of the Institute for Global Health Security.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2013, the Center changed its name from "Center for Biosecurity of UPMC" to "UPMC Center for Health Security". This name change reflected a broadening of the scope of CHS's work.

In January 2017, the Center became part of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. Its [[domain name]] changed from upmchealthsecurity.org to centerforhealthsecurity.org.&lt;ref name="jh_rename" /&gt;

==Funding==

In 2002, the Center received a $1 million grant from the US federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2002/biodefense-grant.html |date=January 7, 2002 |title=Biodefense Center to Receive $1 Million |author=JH Bloomberg School of Public Health |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2017, CHS was heavily reliant on government funding.&lt;ref name="open_phil" /&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Open Philanthropy Project]] awarded a $16 million grant over three years to the Center for Health Security.&lt;ref name="open_phil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity/center-health-security-biosecurity-global-health-security-and-global-catastrophic |title=Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — Biosecurity, Global Health Security, and Global Catastrophic Risks |publisher= Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedailyrecord.com/2017/02/08/maryland-health-security-grant-hopkins/ |title=Hopkins' Center for Health Security gets $16M grant |publisher=Maryland Daily Record |author=Associated Press |date=February 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |quote=The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Health Security has been awarded a three-year, $16 million grant to support work on strengthening health security and public health preparedness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/8/center-for-health-security-gets-16m-grant/ |publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]'' |title=Center for Health Security gets $16M grant |date=February 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conferences and events==

===Clade X===

On May 15, 2018, the Center hosted [http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/index.html Clade X], a day-long pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated a series of National Security Council–convened meetings of 10 US government leaders, played by individuals prominent in the fields of national security or epidemic response.

Drawing from actual events, Clade X identified important policy issues and preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will and attention. These issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate the participants and the audience.

Clade X was [http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/livestream livestreamed] on Facebook and extensive materials from the exercise [http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/clade-x-resources are available online].

===Atlantic Storm===

On January 14, 2005, CHS helped to host [[Atlantic Storm]], a table-top [[smallpox]] [[bioterrorism]] simulation.&lt;ref name="open_phil" /&gt;

===Operation Dark Winter===

From June 22–23, 2001, CHS co-hosted [[Operation Dark Winter]], a senior-level bioterrorism attack simulation involving a covert and widespread smallpox attack on the United States.

'''Lacewood''' is a common name for the wood produced from a number of different trees, with mostly a striking appearance of their „[[lace]]-wood“, which gets its name from the lacelike pattern: These include:
* ''[[Allanblackia floribunda]]'', ''[[Allanblackia parviflora]]'', west african trees
* ''[[Cardwellia sublimis]]'', an australian tree
* ''[[Elaeocarpus bojeri]]'', „bois dentelle“, due to the unique patterns of its flowers

'''Lechatelierite''' is [[silica]] glass, [[amorphous]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, non-crystalline [[mineraloid]].

==Structure==
Lechatelierite is a [[mineraloid]] as it does not have a [[crystal structure]]. Although not a true mineral, it is often classified in the [[quartz]] mineral group.

==Formation==
One common way in which lechatelierite forms naturally is by very high temperature melting of [[quartz]] sand during a [[lightning]] strike. The result is an irregular, branching, often foamy hollow tube of silica glass called a [[fulgurite]].&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-2363.html Lechatelierite on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all fulgurites are lechatelierite; the original sand must be nearly pure silica.

Lechatelierite also forms as the result of high pressure [[shock metamorphism]] during [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]ing and is a common component of a type of glassy [[ejecta]] called [[tektite]]s. Most tektites are blobs of impure glassy material, but tektites from the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] in [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]], known as ''[[Libyan desert glass]]'', are composed of almost pure silica that is almost pure lechatelierite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-39796.html Libyan Desert Glass on Mindat]&lt;/ref&gt; High pressure experiments have shown that shock pressures of 85 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] are needed to produce lechatelierite in quartz grains embedded in [[granite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC98/pdf/1671.pdf C. Schrand and A. Deutsch, 1998, ''Formation of Lechatelierite and Impact Melt Glasses in Experimentally Shocked Rocks'', Lunar and Planetary Science XXIX 1671.pdf retrieved Sept. 13, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechatelierite was formed during the impact of a [[meteorite]] into a layer of [[Coconino Sandstone]] at [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]]. During the rapid pressure reduction following the impact, steam expanded the newly formed lechatelierite. The shattered and expanded glass has a density less than that of water.&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/earth-and-planetary-sciences-halls/arthur-ross-hall-of-meteorites/meteorite-impacts/meteor-crater/puffed-up-and-pulverized | title=Puffed up and pulverised | publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] | accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechatelierite may also form artificially, a unique example being the ''[[trinitite]]'' produced by melting of quartz sand at the first nuclear bomb explosion at Trinity Flats, [[White Sands, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Lechatelierite.shtml Lechatelierite on Webmineral]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human settlement|Settlement]]s built on [[volcano]]es of recent origin or somewhere on their [[complex volcano|volcanic complex]]es or [[volcanic field]]s.  These volcanoes may be active, dormant or otherwise may not be entirely extinct.  Such settlements are subject to potential future volcanic hazards, including but not limited to volcanic eruption, [[hydrothermal]] activity or [[volcanic gas]]es in their vicinity.  This category does not include settlements merely ''threatened'' by volcanic activity but which are located at a distance away, and not located on the volcanic structure itself.  It does include settlements which have volcano evacuation routes/procedures or warning systems.

The '''Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor''' is a proposed nuclear fusion reactor. It is the goal of a project at [[Lockheed Martin]]’s [[Skunk Works]]. It is a high-beta fusion reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FuseNet: The European Fusion Education Network|url=http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035703/http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-[[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] configuration allows a [[Compact toroid|compact fusion reactor]] (CFR) design and expedited development. 

''High beta'' implies that the ratio of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure to magnetic pressure is greater than or equal to 1. By contrast [[tokamak]] designs reach only 0.05.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The CFR chief designer and technical team lead is [[Thomas McGuire (engineer)|Thomas McGuire]].&lt;ref name="aw20141020"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/meet-leader-skunk-works-compact-fusion-reactor-team|title=Meet The Leader Of Skunk Works’ Compact Fusion Reactor Team|last1=Hedden|first1=Carole|date=2014-10-20|work=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuire studied fusion as a source of space propulsion in response to a NASA desire to improve travel times to Mars.&lt;ref name="guyReac"&gt;{{citation|title=Skunk Works Reveals Compact Fusion Reactor Details|date=15 October 2014|url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-details|last1=Norris|first1=Guy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017164725/http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-details|work=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]|accessdate=18 October 2014|archivedate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guyHope"&gt;{{citation|title=High Hopes – Can Compact Fusion Unlock New Power For Space And Air Transport?|date=14 October 2014|url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/high-hopes-can-compact-fusion-unlock-new-power-space-and-air-transport|last1=Norris|first1=Guy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018065452/http://aviationweek.com/blog/high-hopes-can-compact-fusion-unlock-new-power-space-and-air-transport|deadurl=no|work=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hedLead"&gt;{{citation|title=The Leader Of Skunk Works' Compact Fusion Reactor Team|date=20 October 2014|url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/meet-leader-skunk-works-compact-fusion-reactor-team|last1=Hedden|first1=Carole|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018153950/http://aviationweek.com/technology/meet-leader-skunk-works-compact-fusion-reactor-team|deadurl=no|work=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The project began in 2010,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/news-analysis/new-details-on-compact-fusion-reveal-scale-of-challenge/1019393.article|title = New details on compact fusion reveal scale of challenge|last = Nathan|first = Stuart|date = 22 October 2014|work = The Engineer|accessdate = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was publicly presented at the Google [[Solve for X]] forum on February 7, 2013.

In October 2014 [[Lockheed Martin]] announced a plan to "build and test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year with a prototype to follow within five years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/lockheed-says-makes-breakthrough-fusion-energy-project-123840986--finance.html|title=Lockheed says makes breakthrough on fusion energy project|last1=Shalal|first1=Andrea|accessdate=15 October 2014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2016, Rob Weiss announced that Lockheed Martin continued to support the project and would increase its investment in it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/05/lockheed-portable-fusion-proejct-still.html|title=Lockheed Portable Fusion project still making progress|first=Brian|last=Wang|date=May 3, 2016|website=[[Next Big Future]]|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/innovation/2016/05/03/lockheed-nuclear-fusion-generator-investment/83870398/|title=Lockheed Still Supporting Portable Nuclear Generator|first= Aaron |last=Mehta|date=May 3, 2016|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Lockheed Martins' Compact Fusion Reactor.png|thumb|A sketch of the plasma geometry and magnetic coils inside an early model of Lockheed Martins' compact fusion reactor. This design has since been superseded with a model using only two main cusps.]]

CFR plans to achieve high beta (the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure) by combining cusp confinement and [[magnetic mirror]]s to confine the plasma. Cusps are sharply bent magnetic fields. Ideally, the plasma forms a sheath along the surface of the cusps and plasma leaks out along the axis and edges of the sharply bent field.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Thomas. "The Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor." Thursday Colloquium. Princeton University, Princeton. 6 Aug. 2015. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma lost along the edges recycles back into the cusps.

CFR uses two mirror sets. A pair of ring mirrors is placed inside the cylindrical reactor vessel at either end. The other mirror set encircles the reactor cylinder. The ring magnets produce a type of [[magnetic field]] known as a [[diamagnetic]] cusp, in which magnetic forces rapidly change direction and push the nuclei towards the midpoint between the two rings. The fields from the external magnets push the nuclei back towards the vessel ends.

Magnetic field strength is an increasing function of distance from the center. This implies that as the plasma pressure causes the plasma to expand, the magnetic field becomes stronger at the plasma edge, increasing containment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

CFR employs [[superconducting magnets]]. These allow strong magnetic fields to be created with less energy than conventional magnets. The CFR has no net current, which Lockheed claimed eliminates the prime source of plasma instabilities. The plasma has a favorable surface-to-volume ratio, which improves confinement. The plasma's small volume reduces the energy needed to achieve fusion.

The project plans to replace the [[microwave]] emitters that heat the plasma in their prototypes with [[neutral beam injection]], in which electrically neutral [[deuterium]] atoms transfer their energy to the plasma. Once initiated, the energy from fusion maintains the necessary temperature for subsequent fusion events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The eventual device may reach {{val|21|u=m}} in width.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The company claims that each design iteration is shorter and far lower cost than large-scale projects such as the [[Joint European Torus]], [[ITER]] or [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/531836/does-lockheed-martin-really-have-a-breakthrough-fusion-machine/|title = Does Lockheed Martin Really Have a Breakthrough Fusion Machine?|last = Talbot|first = David|date = October 20, 2014|work = [[Technology Review]]|accessdate = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{val|200|u=MW}} [[Thermal power station|P&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]] reactor, {{val|18|u=m}} long by {{val|7|u=m}} in diameter, produces about a {{val|2000|u=ton}} reactor, similar in size to an [[United States naval reactors|A5W]] nuclear submarine fission reactor.&lt;ref name="T4B"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor Concept, Confinement Model and T4B Experiment|url=http://fusion4freedom.us/pdfs/McGuireAPS.pdf|publisher=Lockheed Martin Corporation|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092237/http://fusion4freedom.us/pdfs/McGuireAPS.pdf|archive-date=December 25, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=wang|first1=brian|title=Lockheed compact fusion reactor design about 100 times larger than first plans|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/05/lockheed-compact-fusion-reactor-design-about-100-times-larger-than-first-plans.html|website=NextBigFuture.com|publisher=New big future Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===
Ring magnets require protection from the plasma's neutron radiation. Plasma temperatures must reach many millions of [[kelvin]]s. Superconducting magnets must be kept just above [[absolute zero]] to maintain [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''blanket'' component that lines the reactor vessel has two functions: it captures the neutrons and transfers their energy to a coolant, and forces the neutrons to collide with [[lithium]] atoms, transforming them into tritium to fuel the reactor. The blanket must be an estimated 80–150&amp;nbsp;cm thick and weigh 300–1000 tons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Prototypes==
The prototype was planned to be a 100-megawatt [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] reactor measuring {{convert|7 by 10|ft}} that could fit on the back of a large truck and would be about one tenth the size of current reactor prototypes. 100 megawatts is enough to provide power for 80,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Norris|first1=Guy|date=20 October 2014|title=Fusion Frontier|magazine=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of prototypes were constructed to approach this goal.

===T-4===
Technical results presented on the T4 experiment in 2015 showed a cold, partially ionized plasma with the following parameters: peak electron temperature of 20 [[Electron volts]], {{val|e=16|u=m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} electron density, less than 1% ionization fraction and {{val|3|u=kW}} of input power. No confinement or fusion reaction rates were presented.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

McGuire presented two theoretical reactor concepts in 2015. One was an ideal configuration weighing 200 metric tons with 1 meter of cryogenic radiation shielding and 15 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnets. The other was a conservative configuration weighing 2,000 metric tons, with 2 meters of cryogenic radiation shielding and 5 Tesla magnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Regina|title=Preliminary density and temperature measurements in Lockheed Martin's magnetically encapsulated linear ring cusp confinement configuration|journal=57th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics|date=November 20, 2015|volume=60|issue=10|ref=YP12.00044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual property ==
In February 2018, Lockheed Martin was granted one patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|20180047462A1|Encapsulating Magnetic Fields for Plasma Confinement}}. [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180047462A1/en Google patent database]&lt;/ref&gt; It applied for three others.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent application

== Criticism ==
Physics professor and director of the [[Culham Centre for Fusion Energy|UK's national Fusion laboratory]] [[Steven Cowley]] called for more data, pointing out that the current thinking in fusion research is that "bigger is better". Other fusion reactors achieve 8 times improvement in heat confinement when machine size is doubled.&lt;ref name=cowl&gt;{{citation |author=McGarry, Brendan |url=http://defensetech.org/2014/10/16/scientists-skeptical-of-lockheeds-fusion-breakthrough/ |title=Scientists Skeptical of Lockheed's Fusion Breakthrough |work=DefenseTech' |date=16 October 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Minor comma grammar. Also, it doesn't really matter, but caesium should probably be linked the same way both times - "Caesium" is preferred in scientific papers (and on Wikipedia) per the IUPAC standard.</comment>

The '''Central Mexican Plateau''', also known as the '''Mexican Altiplano''' ({{lang-es|Altiplanicie Mexicana}}), is a large arid-to-semiarid [[plateau]] that occupies much of northern and central [[Mexico]]. Averaging {{convert|1825|meters|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, it extends from the [[US-Mexico border|United States border]] in the north to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the south, and is bounded by the {{lang|es|[[Sierra Madre Occidental]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|es|[[Sierra Madre Oriental]]|italic=no}} to the west and east, respectively.

A low east-west mountain range in the state of [[Zacatecas]] divides the plateau into northern and southern sections. These two sections, called the Northern Plateau ({{lang|es|Mesa del Norte}}) and Central Plateau ({{lang|es|Mesa Central}}), are now generally regarded by geographers as sections of one plateau.

The Mexican Plateau is mostly covered by [[deserts and xeric shrublands]], with [[madrean pine-oak woodlands|pine-oak forests]] covering the surrounding mountain ranges and forming [[sky island]]s on some of the interior ranges. The Mexican Altiplano is one of six distinct physiographic sections of the [[Basin and Range Province]], which in turn is part of the [[Intermontane Plateaus]] physiographic division.

In [[phytogeography]], the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran [[Floristic province|Floristic Province]] of the [[Madrean Region]] in southwestern [[North America]], part of the [[Holarctic|Holarctic Kingdom]] of the northern [[Western Hemisphere]].

While the plateau stretches from north to south, the southern east-west arc of the Central Mexican Plateau from Jalisco to Veracruz states historically as well as today has served as the population nexus of the Mexican nation, it is home to its biggest metro areas of Guadalajara, Leon, Querétaro, Morelia, Mexico City, Toluca, Cuernavaca, and Puebla.

==Geography==
[[File:Chihuahua Steppe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mesa del Norte is part of the extreme northern part of the Mexican Plateau.]]

The Mesa del Norte or northern plateau averages {{convert|1100|m|ft}} in elevation [[above mean sea level]] and extends south from the [[Rio Grande]] (Río Bravo del Norte) through the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]]. Various narrow, isolated ridges cross the Mesa del Norte and numerous depressions also dot the region, the largest of which is the [[Bolsón de Mapimí]]. The Río Bravo del Norte and its tributary, the [[Río Conchos]], drain portions of the northern plateau, and the [[Pánuco River|Río Pánuco]] and its tributaries drain the southeastern corner. Both drain to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Much of the northern plateau comprises internal drainage basins that do not drain to the sea. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] extends across the northern portion of the northern plateau, while the [[Meseta Central matorral]] covers the central portion, and the [[Central Mexican matorral]] extends from the southern portion of the northern plateau across the southern plateau.

The Mesa Central or southern plateau is higher than its northern counterpart, averaging {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation. The southern plateau contains numerous valleys originally formed by ancient lakes. It extends across the states of [[Aguascalientes]], [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Querétaro]], [[Michoacán]]. Several of Mexico's most prominent cities, including [[Guadalajara]], are located in the valleys of the southern plateau. Much of the southern plateau is drained by the [[Río Grande de Santiago]] and its tributaries, including the [[Río Lerma]], which drain west into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Tributaries of the Río Pánuco drain the eastern portion of the southern plateau. The Central Mexican matorral covers much of the southern plateau, with the subtropical [[Bajío dry forests]] occupying the lower portions of the Lerma–Río Grande de Santiago basin. Higher altitudes are covered by [[Mixed Forest]]s, then Temperate [[Coniferous Forest]]s, up to the snow line in the top of the volcanoes that surround the southern and western edges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5995">'''Mobile metering''' (recording of data using a mobile meter) is a technology which enables mobile recording of metering data. While railway companies such as the German Deutsche Bahn have been using this technology for years in their trains, it is now also being used for recording the charging transactions of electric vehicles (EVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weil/Neumann|first=|date=January 2017|title=Vergleichende Betrachtung der Sicherheitskonzepte von Mobile Metering und Smart Meter Gateways|url=|journal=PTB-Mitteilungen|volume=125|pages=53–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cite journal|last=Weil/Neumann|first=|date=January 2016|title=Vergleichende Betrachtung der Sicherheitskonzepte von Mobile Metering und Smart Meter Gateways|url=|journal=Physikalisch-technische Bundesanstalt (National Metrology Institute of Germany)|volume=125|pages=53–58|via=}}

In the latter case, a mobile electricity meter is integrated either into the vehicle itself or into the respective charging cable. This, together with the necessary communication technology (SIM card), makes it possible to transmit charging data (down to the kWh) to a matching backend. Lean, switchable system sockets suffice for charging – they serve as outlets for the power grid. These system sockets can be reduced to a technical minimum, as the vehicle or the cable, respectively, already carry the necessary billing and communication technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=PTB-Anforderungen 50.7 (PTB-A 50.7) Elektronische und softwaregesteuerte Messgeräte und Zusatzeinrichtungen für Elektrizität, Gas, Wasser und Wärme|last=|first=|publisher=Physikalisch-technische Bundesanstalt (National Metrogoly Institute of Germany)|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cite book|title=PTB-Anforderungen 50.7 (PTB-A 50.7) Elektronische und softwaregesteuerte Messgeräte und Zusatzeinrichtungen für Elektrizität, Gas, Wasser und Wärme.|last=|first=|publisher=PTB (National Metrology Institute of Germany)|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}} This makes these sockets especially affordable and avoids running costs compared to conventional charging infrastructure, such as costs for maintenance or meter point operation. 

As a result, precise metering, secure data transmission and efficient billing fulfill all preconditions for a comprehensive and future-proof charging and billing solution for electric mobility. 

== Development ==

The mobile meter was developed in the projects „On Board Metering I &amp; II“, that kicked off in March 2003, sponsored by the German ministry for economic affairs and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baustein für die Energiewende: 7 Eckpunkte für das „Verordnungspaket Intelligente Netze“|last=|first=|publisher=German Federal Ministry for Economy and Energy|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants of the project were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.all-electronics.de/das-auto-lernt-zaehlen-mobile-metering/#|title=Das Auto lernt zählen: Mobile Metering|last=|first=|work=all-electronics.de|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims of the project ==

The project’s approach to electric mobility was not tackling it as a singular challenge. The aim was rather to make a significant contribution to the energy transition by taking electric mobility one step further.

For this to happen, the EV was to become a system-relevant factor as an energy storage device. The goal was to create as much power grid connection points as possible while at the same time safeguarding exact metering and billing of electricity. This way, the vehicle could gain access to the grid anytime it is parked (ratio of EVs to grid connection points greater than 1). Up to that date, charging infrastructure for electric cars was thought of as stationary, similar to conventional gas stations for combustion cars. 

For this, a shift of technology from the infrastructure to the vehicle side (or the cable, respectively) was needed. Such a network of ubiquitous charging spots was only to be realized with charging infrastructure that would cause comparably low costs over longer periods of time. 

== Potentials of the model ==

The disruptive approach of mobile metering has by now opened up new possibilities and business models for electric mobility. 

*Contribution to grid stability. Electric cars can be integrated into the grid as intelligent storage devices. This makes it easier to incorporate the fluctuating electricity production from renewable resources into the overall grid architecture.
*The technology shift from the infrastructure to the vehicle/cable reduces the cost of charging spots. A ubiquitous roll-out of charging infrastructure can be executed with much lower capital investments.
*Free choice of electricity provider and exact billing. The electricity contract can be closed for the vehicle or cable thanks to the mobile meter, while the choice of the respective provider is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On-Board Metering: Mobiles Messen von Tankstrom in Elektrofahrzeugen – sicher, eichgültig und abrechnungsrelevant.|last=Berg/Zisky|first=|publisher=Kahmann/Zayer|year=2012|isbn=978-3-8022-1058-7|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=283–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/research/ruralelectrification/casestudies/mali/index.shtml Multifunction Platform (MFP)] is a concept and a structure developed by [[UNDP]] and deployed in a number of West African countries, and [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]]. The idea has been to place an MFP in a village which, driven by a [[diesel engine]], powers devices such as [[pumps]] and [[grain mill]]s and [[Electric generator|generators]]. The UNDP has produced a number of reports on this project in [[Mali]] which [http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/index.cfm?module=Library&amp;page=DocumentList&amp;LibraryID=8&amp;RegionID=4&amp;CountryID=MLI can be accessed here.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  There are few independent analyses of the development impact of the concept of the multifunctional platform, but recently an article in the journal Energy Policy,which [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2W-4XSSV3C-4/2/168d4100da1f1b87a2584912bde29b09 can be accessed here], provide a more nuanced view of programme achievements than impact assessments made public at earlier stages of the project.

The primary impact of the MFP has been on women's work (on reducing daily drudgery and opening up new opportunities in life) and the UNDP's deployment has been to women's organisations, with part local funding and part local grant.

In places where [[Jatropha]] is grown, a device, powered by the MFP, can crush the Jatropha seed. The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation. The company Mali Biocarburant has carried out a pilot with in a number of villages in Mali, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211338/http://www.ease-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Final-report-MBSA.pdf reported here]. Also, [http://www.malifolkecenter.org/ The Mali Folke Centre] has reported on its success in this field.

More recently, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140809164402/http://fact-foundation.com/ FACT Foundation] has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. As [http://www.snvworld.org/download/publications/snv_fact_productive_biogas_2014_final.pdf reported here], first results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems.

Volunteers from [[Engineers Without Borders (Canada)|Engineers Without Borders]] have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195956/http://www.nigercurrents.ca/index.php/2006/08/09/p53 reported here].

Whereas the [[UNDP]]'s projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken  in [[Kiliba]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034940/http://aplaceof.info/kiliba/program1.htm Farm of Hope], a project of [[Fondation chirezi]]. However, that project failed to materialise.

The '''National Museums of Kenya''' (NMK) is a state corporation that manages museums, sites and monuments in [[Kenya]]. It carries out heritage research, and has expertise in subjects ranging from [[palaeontology]], [[ethnography]] and [[biodiversity]] research and conservation. Its headquarters and the National Museum ([[Nairobi National Museum]]) are located on Museum Hill, near [[Uhuru Highway]] between Central Business District and [[Westlands]] in [[Nairobi]]. The National Museum of Kenya was founded by the [[East Africa Natural History Society]] (E.A.N.H.S.) in 1910; the Society's main goal has always been to conduct an ongoing critical scientific examination of the natural attributes of the [[East Africa]]n habitat. The museum houses collections, and temporary and permanent exhibits. Today the National Museum of Kenya manages over 22 regional museums, many sites, and monuments across the country.&lt;ref name=NMKweb&gt;NMK, "National Museums of Kenya," 2006-03-31, Museums.or.ke, web: [http://www.museums.or.ke/ MuseumsOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nairobi National Museum of Kenya==

===Natural History Museum of Kenya===
[[File:Prehistory at Nairobi National Museum.jpg|thumb|Prehistory]]
The East Africa and [[Uganda Natural History Society]] was founded in 1910–11 by persons with an interest in nature in [[British East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;It descended to the East Africa Natural History Society, an international organization with outlets in a number of countries. In Kenya it is Nature Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; The group included two canons of the [[Church Missionary Society]]: [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] Harry Leakey (father of [[Louis Leakey]]) and The Rev. Kenneth St. Aubyn Rogers; some government officials: [[Charles William Hobley|C. W. Hobley]] and John Ainsworth, doctors, dentists, big-game hunters and plantation owners. In 1911 they established the Natural History Museum and library with an honorary curator. Aladina Visram put up the money for a one-story, two-room building.&lt;ref&gt;This section relies heavily on L. S. B. Leakey, ''By the Evidence: Memoirs, 1932–1951'', Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 they could afford a paid curator. They brought in [[Arthur Loveridge]], a [[herpetologist]], who arrived in March 1914. Loveridge concentrated on collections, with the members volunteering to contribute specimens, labour and funds. They also ran the museum while Loveridge fought for the British in [[German East Africa]]. He returned for a brief stay after the war, only to go to [[United States|America]], where he eventually became a [[Harvard University]] professor.

===Coryndon Museum===
The next curator was A. F. J. Gedye. The museum moved to a new building at the corner of Government Road and Kirk Road. Among the new volunteers for the society were [[Robert Coryndon|Sir Robert Coryndon]], [[Governor of Kenya]]. At his unexpected death in 1927, Lady Coryndon established the Coryndon Memorial Fund to build a better museum for the society in memory of her husband. The government offered matching funds for public donations and in 1928 construction began.

The building was ready in 1929. Unfortunately no workrooms or storage space had been provided and therefore the Natural History Society declined to move in. The government then bought the old museum and the society used the money to add three rooms, gave its collections to the museum trustees, but retained the library. Everything was moved to the museum. Lady Coryndon donated Sir Robert's books to it.

The museum was officially opened on 22 September 1930, as Coryndon Museum, with [[Victor Gurney Logan Van Someren]], a member, as curator. He was given a [[tied accommodation|house on the grounds]]. In 1930 Evelyn Molony, née Napier was appointed the Museum's first botanist after a grant was given to the Museum by Ernest Carr to fund her employment. During her tenure she established within the Museum a herbarium on East African plants as well as publishing a series of scientific papers on East African flora.&lt;ref name=Bally1953&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=P.R.O.|title=Obituary - Molony|journal=Journal of The East Africa Natural History Society|date=1953|volume=XXII|issue=1|pages=44–45|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/content/part/EANHS/XXII_No.1_93__44_1953_MolonyObit.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the museum trustees and the society became problematic, and as a result the two organisations appointed a committee including Sir Charles Belcher, a Kenyan jurist, to stabilise it. The committee turned everything over to the museum except for the library in exchange for annual payments for 15 years to the society.

The museum now had a staff. [[Mary Leakey]] became part of it and then [[Louis Leakey]], as unpaid curator, in 1941. He stepped in when Dr. van Someren resigned after the board (including Louis) refused to dismiss [[Peter René Oscar Bally|Peter Bally]] in a personality conflict. The museum was a center for Leakey operations. In 1945 Louis was hired as paid curator with a new house, as the old one had become run-down. He built up the exhibitions and opened them to Africans and Asians by lowering the admission fee. Until then the museum had been "for whites only."

The museum was a base for Leakey operations until 1961, when Louis founded the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the grounds nearby and moved himself and his collections to it. He resigned in favour of the next director, [[Robert Herbert Carcasson|Robert Carcasson]].

===National Museum===
Kenya became independent in 1963. The Coryndon Museum was renamed "National Museum" in 1964 and was included in a new system, the "National Museums of Kenya." In 1967 [[Richard Leakey]] was having irreconcilable differences with [[Louis Leakey]], his employer in the Centre, and decided to improve the National Museum. His main objection was that it had not been Kenyanized. He and supporters formed the Kenya Museum Associates, which obtained an observer's seat for Richard on the board from Carcasson in exchange for a 5000-pound contribution. Richard did not do much observing, as he departed for the first Omo expedition.

The Kenya Museum Associates included Joel Ojal, the museum overseer in the government. On his return from Omo Richard gave his ideas for improvement directly to Joel, who asked the chairman, [[Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, 8th Duke of Portland|Sir Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck]], to place Richard in a senior position and begin replacing the board with Kenyans of Kenyan extraction, as there were only two out of 16 in that category. The penalty for inaction would be removal of government funding.

Richard was at first offered a part-time executive position, which he turned down. Over the next few months much of the board was replaced and in May 1968 the new board offered Richard a permanent post as administrative director, with Carcasson to be retained as scientific director. However, Carcasson resigned and Richard became director.

===Modern events and facilities===
On 15 October 2005 Nairobi Museum Galleries closed until December 2007 for an extensive rebuilding program. This was the first major renovation of Nairobi Museum since 1930. A new administration block and commercial center were built, and NMK's physical planning was improved.&lt;ref name=NMKredo&gt;NMK, "National Museums of Kenya – Museum in Change," 2006-03-31, Museums.or.ke, web: [http://www.museums.or.ke/closure.html MuseumsOR-redo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002223337/http://www.museums.or.ke/closure.html |date=2 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum re-opened in June 2008. It houses both temporary and permanent exhibitions.&lt;ref name="NMKredo"/&gt;

Within the grounds are also the [[Nairobi Snake Park]] and the [[botanical garden|Botanic Garden]] and nature trail. The museum's commercial wing has restaurants and shops.

[[Image:Naturecenter.jpg|thumb|A common exhibit found at a nature center.]]
[[File:Villa Cassel.jpg|thumb|The nature centre of [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]] near the [[Aletsch Glacier]] ([[Swiss Alps]]).]]

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

{{Governance}}

'''Ocean governance'''  is the conduct of the policy, actions and affairs regarding the world's [[oceans]]. Within governance, it incorporates the influence of non-state actors, i.e. stakeholders, NGOs and so forth, therefore the state is not the only acting power in policy making. However, in terms of the ocean, this is a complex issue because it is a commons that is not ‘owned’ by any single nation/state. The consequences of this has resulted in humankind abusing the oceans’ resources, by treating them as shared resources, but not taking equal and collective responsibilities in caring for them.&lt;ref&gt;Boesch, D.F. (1999) The role of science in ocean governance. ''Ecological Economics'', 31, pp. 189–198.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that rules on the conduct of the ocean can only be implemented through international agreements.&lt;ref name= DeSombre&gt;DeSombre, E.R. (2006) ''Global Environmental Institutions'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is a need for some form of governance to maintain the ocean for its various uses, preferably in a sustainable manner.

==Legal framework==

{{See also|Admiralty law|l1=Admiralty Law}}

There are two major international legal organisations that exist that are involved in ocean governance on a global scale. The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which was ratified in 1958 is responsible mainly for maritime safety, liability and compensation and they have held some conventions on [[marine pollution]] related to shipping incidents.

===IMO marine pollution conventions===

* 1972 – [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]] (LDC)
* 1969 – International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (INTERVENTION).
* 1973 – [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78).
* 1990 – International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation (OPRC).
* 2000 – Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS Protocol).&lt;ref name= DeSombre /&gt;

The IMO sees the regulation of marine pollution as one its most important aspects of governance and in particular, the MARPOL convention is regarded as one of its greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization (IMO), http://www.imo.org/About/Pages/Default.aspx [Accessed: 10/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The result of MARPOL has meant that oil pollution has decreased due to a change in equipment standards of oil tankers to prevent operational discharge of oil.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, R.B. (1994) ''International Oil Pollution at Sea''. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the main organisation concerned with the economic, environmental, ethical, peace and security issues is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

===United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)===

{{Main|UNCLOS|l1=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea}}

It was first established under the Third UNCLOS in 1973 and fully ratified in 1982. The main aim was to adopt a regime of national seas and international waters on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Birnie, P.W. (1993) The Law of the Sea and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In: N. Ginsburg, E. Mann Borgese and J. R. Morgan (eds.) ''Ocean Yearbook'', Vol 10, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 13–35.&lt;/ref&gt; What was agreed was that the jurisdictional boundaries of individual states were to be enlarged to 200 nautical miles off a state’s coastline. Coastal states were given greater rights to control these areas for protective purposes and the exploitation of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Vallega, A. (2001) ''Sustainable Ocean Governance: A geographical perspective''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In total 38 million square nautical miles of ocean space was put under jurisdiction under the [[EEZ|Exclusive Economic Zones]] (EEZ) and the legalities concerning the continental shelf and territorial sea were altered.&lt;ref name= UNCLOS&gt;Oceans and the Law of the Sea, http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Convention did not come into full effect despite a number of implementations being carried out between 1973 and 1982. This was profoundly due to a dispute over mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules in the deep-oceans. Developing countries preferred treating these minerals as “[[Common heritage of mankind|common heritage]],” that via an international organisation, they could benefit from a sharing of these resources.&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, S.D. (1985) ''Structural Conflict: The Third World Against Global Liberalism'', Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the developed world, in particular the United States, was not in favour of this and preferring a first-come, first-served basis, due to self-economic interest. Only in 1994 did the United States renounce their objections so that the Convention could be enacted.

====Institutions established by UNCLOS====

* [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA) – An independent international institution that came into force in 1994, with the aim of acting as a custodian of ocean commons (the Common Heritage of Mankind). However its main purpose is to regulate deep seabed mining.&lt;ref&gt;International Seabed Authority (ISA), http://www.isa.org.jm/en/about [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) – Assists states in affairs to do with the establishment of outer limits of their continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Oceans and the Law of the Sea, http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/commission_purpose.htm#Purpose [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ITLOS|Regime for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] (ITLOS) – This was established to handle disputes with the application and interpretations of UNCLOS.&lt;ref&gt;International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=8&amp;L=0 [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Meeting of the State Parties (SPLOS) - carried out to conform with the article 319, paragraph 2 (e) to the LOSC Convention and is concerned with administrative matters.&lt;ref name= Repetto&gt;Repetto, M.S. (2005) ''Towards an ocean governance framework and national policy for Peru''. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/depts/los/nippon/unnff_programme_home/fellows_pages/fellows_papers/repetto_0506_peru.pdf&gt; [Accessed:12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory Governance in Ocean Governance==

Despite an obvious need for international bodies to control and manage the resources, it has been argued that for sustainable governance of the ocean to occur, it needs to be participatory.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. (1999) The ecological, economic and social importance of the oceans. ''Ecological Economics'', 31, pp. 199–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the potential importance of participatory governance was first truly highlighted in [[Agenda 21]], signed at the [[UNCED]] (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It was stated that:
::''“Broad public participation in decision making was a fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of sustainable development.”''&lt;ref&gt;UNCED (1992) Agenda 21. ‘’United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 1992’’. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/&gt; [Accessed: 11/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

What this means is that the public needs to be more actively involved along with the other stakeholders and authoritative bodies. This stems from democratic principles where the people are empowered to choose their own government, so with environmental concerns perhaps they should be involved in these in a similar manner. With the inclusion of people in a decision making process, it immediately secures legitimacy for these decisions.&lt;ref name= Evans&gt;Evans, J.P. (2012) ''Environmental Governance'', Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that expert scientific knowledge is important, but often enough “lay-knowledge” is equally credible concerning certain resources (in this case an example would be a fishery) and uncertainties within science itself. By engaging public participation, the benefit is that it is able to frame the environmental decision with the community in mind and how it will impact them.&lt;ref name= Evans /&gt; This would significantly be useful for ocean governance at a local and national level, in particular areas with coastal communities.

Due to the nature of participatory governance being resource intensive, it would be harder to expand this to regional levels and beyond. It is also important to not necessarily enrol too many stakeholders, as there may be the ‘participation paradox’ that essentially means the greater the number of stakeholders, the fewer the responsibilities and involvement of each one and their effectiveness is reduced in the process.&lt;ref&gt;De Vivero, J., Mateos, J. and del Corral, D. (2008) The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance. The rising number of actors and the devolution process. ''Marine Policy'', 32, pp. 319–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of Participatory Governance to Integrated Coastal and Ocean Management in Canada (ICOM)===

In 2002, Canada introduced the Oceans Strategy, which was heavily based on participatory governance principles: 
::''“The governance model proposed for Integrated Management is one of collaboration. It involves ocean management decisions based on shared information, on consultation with stakeholders, and on their advisory or management participation in the planning process. It is also based on institutional arrangements that bring together all stakeholders. Participants take an active part in designing, implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of coastal and ocean management plans, and partners enter into agreements on ocean management plans with specific responsibilities, powers and obligations. It is also recognized that in specific cases, Integrated Management and planning may be achieved through co-management.”&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada (2002) Canada’s Ocean Strategy: Our Oceans, Our Future. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/cosframework-cadresoc/pdf/im-gi-eng.pdf&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Study: The Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative====

The aim of the ESSIM Initiative is to create integrated and [[adaptive management]] plans that are a collaborative effort for ecosystem, social, economic and institutional sustainability of the [[Eastern Scotian Shelf]].&lt;ref name=FOC&gt;Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2001) ''The Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative: Development of a Collaborative Management and Planning Process''. Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates maintaining existing jurisdictional responsibilities, inclusion, consensus, accountability, dispute resolution, networking, evolution, and learning by doing, which are all part of the governance principles in the Oceans Strategy.&lt;ref name= FOC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BL Smith Workgroup Inc. (2004) Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management Initiative: Proposed Collaborative Planning Model. A Discussion Paper. In: ‘’Oceans and Coastal Management Report 2004–2005’’: Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

How it works is that the Stakeholders Roundtable (lead stakeholders and government) and the Planning Office draft up a management plan and this is then reviewed at the ESSIM Forum (an annual stakeholders’ meeting), community meetings and the general public. Overall, an agreement then must be reached with the Stakeholder Roundtable and a final plan given to appropriate federal and provincial government agencies, before acquiring final approval under the Oceans Act.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada (1996) Canada Oceans Act, RSC 1996: Bill C-26, Chapter 31, 2nd Session, 35th Parliament, 45, Eliz. 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as fairly successful in improving communication and cooperation within government agencies, but there is room for greater inclusion of coastal community participation to fully fulfil the participatory theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, J., Berkes, F., Charles, A., Pinkerton, E. and Wiber, M. (2007) The Role of Participatory Governance and Community-Based Management in Integrated Coastal Management in Canada. ''Coastal Management'', 35, pp. 79–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of implementation==

Ocean governance can be carried out at a local, national, regional or international level. However, there needs to be a link between all levels of implementation for “good” ocean governance to build on the theory of participatory governance at these different levels. Yet one of the greatest problems with ocean governance is that the organisations lack authority and instruments to guarantee compliance and enforcement of these laws.&lt;ref name= UNESCO&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ''Ocean governance and institutional challenges''. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/ioc-oceans/priority-areas/rio-20-ocean/ocean-governance/&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local===
Community-based management features in local implementation as stated in [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|Principle 22]] at Rio. What this means is that the state needs to recognise the importance that indigenous and local communities play in sustainable environmental policy making and how they can be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (1992) Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 3–14 June 1992. Annex I “Rio Declaration on Environment and Development” [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm&gt; [Accessed: 11/12/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Also the stakeholders should take a role of responsibility with the government in a form of co-management to manage ocean resources.

===National===

At a national level, ocean governance is seen as an integrated management process within one state. This means there is a focus on almost all ministries of a government that have a function or authority related to ocean sectors and they collaborate.&lt;ref name= UNESCO /&gt; Due to ocean issues usually being low on a political agenda, it is said that to be successful integrated ocean policy is in need of the highest political direction and oversight to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo, S.M. (1994) New structures for decision-making in integrated ocean policy. In: P. B. Payoyo (ed.) ''Ocean governance: Sustainable development of the sea''. Tokyo: United Nations University Press, pp. 71–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional===

At this scale, the scope of management and challenges are greater, so governance requires more organisations. It comprises Regional Seas Programme of [[UNEP]] creating programmes to be managed and coordinated by countries that share a common body of water. These Action Plans range from chemical waste to conservation of marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): Regional Seas, [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/about/default.asp&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt; These however need to be strengthened along with The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA).&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

To be effective Regional Development Banks (RDBs) and Regional Governmental Organizations (RGOs) are necessary to participate and provide reinforcement of the former organisations. Therefore, a mandate is required for the implementation of sub-regional programs, agreements and conventions to ensure consensus-based decision-making.&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

===International===

The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] is seen as the proficient international body to implement ocean governance. It functions by the Secretary General producing reports on the recommendations by the Consultative Process of ocean matters and the law of the sea, which are then annually reviewed by The General Assembly.&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

==Examples of marine resource governance==
===Fishing===
The direct use of the ocean inherently comes from fishing for food resources, mainly for human consumption. In 2009, 79.9 million tonnes of fish were caught from a marine environment.&lt;ref name= FAO&gt;[[FAO|Fishing and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) (2010) ''The state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2010''. [online] Available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1820e/i1820e.pdf [Accessed: 10/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  While the FAO have stated that over half (53%) of fish stocks were said to be at full exploitation and thus their current catches are close to the maximum sustainable production levels.&lt;ref name= FAO /&gt; Therefore, it is important for an international agreement and policies to be in place, or nations will feel they are welcome to exploit the fish stocks beyond a sustainable level if there are no rules guiding fishing practices. Yet under UNCLOS, it is said that almost 99% of all fisheries are within a nation’s jurisdiction, however this is not preventing problems of exploitation.&lt;ref name= UNCLOS /&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, numerous fishery organisations appeared, which are narrowly focused but struggle to prevent global [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name= DeSombre /&gt; As a result, there are problems with [[illegal fishing]] vessels, violating the laws of a fishery in which they may misreport their catches to authorities or are vessels that are not certified to be within an area of water. The reason for this is usually due to a certain fish species with a high economic value, for example Bluefin Tuna.

Overcoming the problem of poor [[fishery management]] may be work best by transitioning to rights-based fishing and self-governance, which incorporates participatory governance theory. For it to work, there still needs to be a financial incentive that will fund it and ‘shares’ are distributed between the shareholders (individual/corporation, community or fishers’ collective) that are linked directly to the productivity and value of the resource, which consequently will make the shareholders appreciate the resource better and prevent overfishing.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;Allison, E. H. (2001) Big laws, small catches:  Global ocean governance and the fisheries crisis. ''Journal of International Development'', 13, pp. 933–950.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when shareholders have an individual share, it reduces the competition between them since they are not allowed more than their share.

There is a focus on rights-based approaches in current development programmes, which have an emphasis on creating (or recreating) and supporting local institutions to the fishery.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt; While a freedom of rights will result in economic benefits, there is a possibility of a monopolisation by more larger and powerful shareholders that will squeeze out small-scaled operations. The problem though with fisher folk having more rights, is they subsequently lack the transfer of skills to do with information, assessment, management and negotiation and they also lack sufficient funding due to their self-governing nature.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt;

An alternative approach has been introducing market incentives to encourage sustainable fishing. The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) introduced this through a fishery certification programme, with the incentive that the consumer will buy fish only caught by sustainable fisheries. This in turn creates a cycle that encourages the producer to abide by sustainable practices to gain the custom. To date (December 2011) there are currently 135 certified fisheries in the MSC Program.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified [Accessed: 13/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pileated woodpecker''' (''Dryocopus pileatus'') is a [[woodpecker]] native to [[North America]]. This insectivorous bird is a mostly sedentary inhabitant of [[deciduous]] forests in eastern North America, the [[Great Lakes]], the [[boreal forest]]s of [[Canada]], and parts of the [[Pacific coast]]. It is the second-largest woodpecker on the continent, after the critically endangered — and possibly extinct — [[ivory-billed woodpecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, Life History |url= https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ivory-billed_Woodpecker/lifehistory|website=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology; All About Birds |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pileated" refers to the bird's prominent red crest, with the term from the [[Latin]] ''pileatus'' meaning "capped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pileated_woodpecker |title= Pileated woodpecker|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:111 Pileated Woodpecker, b.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Plate 111 of the'' [[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' by [[John James Audubon]], depicting pileated woodpeckers (1 ♀, 3 ♂♂)]]
Adults are {{convert|40|to|49|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, span {{convert|66|to|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} across the wings, and weigh {{convert|250|to|400|g|oz|abbr=on}}, with an average weight of {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Each wing measures {{convert|21.4|to|25.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the tail measures {{convert|14.0|to|17.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the bill is {{convert|4.1|to|6.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the tarsus measures {{convert|3.1| to|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;''Woodpeckers: An Identification Guide to the Woodpeckers of the World'' by Hans Winkler, David A. Christie &amp; David Nurney. Houghton Mifflin (1995), {{ISBN|978-0395720431}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mainly black with a red [[Crest (feathers)|crest]], and have a white line down the sides of the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct, but undulates in the way characteristic of woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black.&lt;ref name=NW&gt;[http://www.nhptv.org/NatureWorks/pileatedwoodpecker.htm Pileated Woodpecker], Nature Works&lt;/ref&gt; Two species found in the [[Old World]], the [[White-bellied woodpecker|white-bellied]] and [[black woodpecker]]s, are closely related and occupy the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt; The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] of the [[southeastern United States]] and [[Cuba]], and the related [[imperial woodpecker]] of [[Mexico]]. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not [[List of extinct birds|extinct]]. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.

===Subspecies===
Up to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically. However, many authors only recognize two subspecies, the southernly ''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'' and the northerly ''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola'', and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described. Generally, pileated woodpeckers follow [[Bergmann's rule]] being smaller and more compact in the south (''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'') and larger in the north (''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola''). The ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/species/conifer/piwoacct.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Southern pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'') – the southeastern U.S., except [[Florida]]
*Northern pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola'') – from the [[Canadian Prairies]] provinces east through [[Eastern Canada]] and the northern United States
*Florida pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''floridanus'') – the [[Florida peninsula]] and [[Florida Keys]]
*Western pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''picinus'') – western North America

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is forested areas across Canada, the eastern United States, and parts of the [[Pacific]] coast. This bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks. They specifically prefer [[mesic habitat]]s with large, mature hardwood trees, often being found in large tracts of forest. However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees. Efforts to restore woodland by removing invasive honeysuckle and buckthorn seem to benefit them, as the removal of brush and shrubbery facilitates their foraging on the ground and in the lower stratum.&lt;ref name="garc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Evan |title=More Pileated Woodpeckers: Emerald Ash Borer or Healthier Habitat? |url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2016/04/07/more-pileated-woodpeckers-emerald-ash-borer-or-healthier-habitat |publisher=Chicago Tonight |date = 7 April 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Pileated Woodpecker male.jpg|thumb|upright|Male drilling in wood]]
These birds mainly eat insects, especially [[carpenter ant]]s and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including [[poison ivy]] berries.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, F.E. 1895. Preliminary report on the food of Woodpeckers. United States Department of Agriculture. Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy. Bulletin No. 7. Government Printing Office. Washington, District of Columbia. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Pileated woodpeckers often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant colonies.&lt;ref name=NW/&gt; They also lap up ants by reaching with their long tongues into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees, but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a variety of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars, and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.

Usually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. Pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and do not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes — made similarly by all woodpeckers — provide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species. The pileated woodpecker also nests in boxes about {{convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the ground.
{{listen|filename=Dryocopus pileatus.ogg|title=call}}
{{listen|filename=Dryocopus pileatus - Pileated Woodpecker - XC71727.ogg|title=display drum (a short burst of 10 taps)}}
A pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is not migratory. They defend the territory in all seasons, but tolerate floaters during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/species/birds/birdpages/dry_pil.htm Pileated Woodpecker], Canadian Biodiversity Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; When clashing with conspecifics, they engage in much chasing, calling, striking with the wings, and jabbing with the bill. Drumming is most commonly to proclaim a territory, and hollow trees are often used to make the most resonant sound possible. The display drum consists of a burst of 11 to 30 taps delivered in less than a second.&lt;ref name="twice"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pileated Woodpecker tapping twice |url= http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/multimedia/sounds/listening/pw |website=Big Woods Conservation Partnership |publisher=Cornell University |date=2018 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest — a rare habit in birds. The cavity is unlined except for wood chips. Both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days. The average clutch size is four per nest. The young may take a month to fledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkaboutwildlife.ca/profile/?s=191 Pileated Woodpecker], Talk about Wildlife {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210329/http://talkaboutwildlife.ca/profile/?s=191 |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old. Predators at the nest can include [[American marten]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[rat snake]]s, and [[gray fox]]es. Free-flying adults have fewer predators, but can be taken in some numbers by [[Cooper's hawk]]s, [[northern goshawk]]s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[barred owl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pileatedwoodpeckercentral.com/information.htm |accessdate=June 20, 2012| title=Pileated Woodpecker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717065851/http://www.pileatedwoodpeckercentral.com/information.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The pileated woodpecker occupies a large range and is quite adaptable. Its ability to survive in many wooded habitat types has allowed the species to survive human habitation of North America much better than the more specialized ivory-billed woodpecker. Pileated woodpeckers have a large population size, and despite being nonmigratory, are protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Act. While the large birds control many insect populations, especially tree beetles, that may otherwise experience outbreaks, some people may consider them harmful if found on their property due to the considerable damage that pileated woodpeckers can do to trees and homes.

A '''pressure–volume diagram''' (or '''PV diagram''', or '''volume–pressure loop''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch5/s3ch5_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe corresponding changes in [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] and [[pressure]] in a system.  They are commonly used in [[thermodynamics]], [[cardiovascular physiology]], and [[respiratory physiology]].

PV diagrams, originally called '''indicator diagrams''', were developed in the 18th century as tools for understanding the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s.

==Description==
A PV diagram plots the change in pressure ''P'' with respect to volume ''V'' for some [[thermodynamic process|process]] or processes.  Typically in thermodynamics, the set of processes forms a [[thermodynamic cycle|cycle]], so that upon completion of the cycle there has been no net change in [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the system; i.e. the device returns to the starting pressure and volume.

The figure shows the features of a typical PV diagram.  A series of numbered states (1 through 4) are noted.  The path between each state consists of some process (A through D) which alters the pressure or volume of the system (or both).
[[File:P-v diagram of a simple cycle.svg|none|230px|Generalized PV diagram]]
A key feature of the diagram is that the amount of energy expended or received by the system as [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] can be estimated as the area under the curve on the chart.  For a cyclic diagram, the net work is that ''enclosed'' by the curve.  In the example given in the figure, the processes 1-2-3 produce a work output, but processes from 3-4-1 require a smaller energy input to return to the starting position / state;  thus the net work is the difference between the two.

Note that this figure is highly idealized, and a diagram showing the processes in a real device would tend to depict a more complex shape of the PV curve.  (See section Applications, below).

==History==
[[Image:Indicator diagram.png|thumb|right|Watt's indicator diagram]]
[[Image:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875]]
The PV diagram, then called an indicator diagram, was developed by [[James Watt]] and his employee [[John Southern (engineer)|John Southern]] (1758–1815) to improve the [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] of engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Hunt (2010) ''Pursuing Power and Light'', page 13, [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8018-9359-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the "volume" axis, while a [[pencil]], attached to a [[pressure gauge]], moved at right angles to the piston, tracing "pressure".

The gauge enabled Watt to calculate the work done by the steam while ensuring that its pressure had dropped to zero by the end of the stroke, thereby ensuring that all useful [[energy]] had been extracted. The total work could be calculated from the area between the "volume" axis and the traced line. The latter fact had been realised by [[Davies Gilbert]] as early as 1792 and used by [[Jonathan Hornblower]] in [[litigation]] against Watt over [[patent]]s on various designs. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] had also had the insight about how to calculate work.

Watt used the diagram to make radical improvements to steam engine performance and long kept it a trade secret. Though it was made public in a letter to the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous), "Account of a steam-engine indicator," ''Quarterly Journal of Science'', vol. 13, page 95 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; it remained somewhat obscure. [[John Farey, Jr.]] only learned of it on seeing it used, probably by Watt's men, when he visited Russia in 1826.

In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] used a diagram of pressure against volume to illustrate and elucidate the [[Carnot cycle]], elevating it to a central position in the study of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapeyron, E. (1834) "Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur" (Memoir on the motive power of heat), ''Journal de l'École Royale Polytechnique'', vol. 14, no. 23, pages 153–190, 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later instruments (''illus.'') used paper wrapped around a cylindrical barrel with a pressure piston inside it, the rotation of the barrel coupled to the piston crosshead by a weight- or spring-tensioned wire.

In 1869 the British marine engineer [[Nicholas Procter Burgh]] wrote a full book on the indicator diagram explaining the device step by step. He had noticed that "a very large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Procter Burgh]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSdWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 The Indicator Diagram Practically Considered].'' E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 1869. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Thermodynamics===
PV diagrams can be used to estimate the net work performed by a [[thermodynamic cycle]].  The net work is the area enclosed by the PV curve in the diagram.  This usage derived from the development of indicator diagrams which were used to estimate the performance of a [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the diagram records the [[pressure]] of steam versus the volume of steam in a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], throughout a [[piston]]'s cycle of motion in a steam engine.  The diagram enables calculation of the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] performed and thus can provide a measure of the power produced by the engine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hills and A. J. Pacey (January 1972) "The measurement of power in early steam-driven textile mills," ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 13, no. 1, pages 25–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|none|450px||Indicator diagram for steam locomotive]]

To exactly calculate the work done by the system it is necessary to calculate the integral of the pressure with respect to volume.  One can often quickly calculate this using the PV diagram as it is simply the area enclosed by the cycle.

Note that in some cases [[specific volume]] will be plotted on the x-axis instead of volume, in which case the area under the curve represents work per unit mass of the working fluid (i.e. J/kg).

===Medicine===
{{main|Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology}}
In [[cardiovascular physiology]], the diagram is often applied to the [[left ventricle]], and it can be mapped to specific events of the [[cardiac cycle]]. [[Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology|PV loop studies]] are widely used in basic research and [[Biomedical research|preclinical testing]], to [[Pressure-Volume Loop Analysis in Cardiology|characterize the intact heart's performance under various situations]] (effect of drugs, disease, characterization of mouse [[Strain (biology)|strains]]),

The sequence of events occurring in every heart cycle is as follows. The left figure shows a PV loop from a real experiment; letters refer to points.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''A''' is the end-[[Diastole|diastolic]] point; this is the point where contraction begins. Pressure starts to increase, becomes rapidly higher than the atrial pressure, and the mitral valve closes. Since pressure is also lower than the aortic pressure, the aortic valve is closed as well.
* Segment '''AB''' is the contraction phase. Since both the mitral and aortic valves are closed, volume is constant. For this reason, this phase is called isovolumic contraction.
* At point '''B''', pressure becomes higher than the aortic pressure and the aortic valve opens, initiating ejection.
* '''BC''' is the ejection phase, volume decreases. At the end of this phase, pressure lowers again and falls below aortic pressure. The aortic valve closes.
* Point '''C''' is the end-[[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] point.
* Segment '''CD''' is the isovolumic relaxation. During this phase, pressure continues to fall. The mitral valve and aortic valve are both closed again so volume is constant.
* At point '''D''' pressure falls below the atrial pressure and the mitral valve opens, initiating ventricular filling.
* '''DA''' is the [[Diastole|diastolic]] filling period. Blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Atrial contraction completes ventricular filling.

As it can be seen, the PV loop forms a roughly rectangular shape and each loop is formed in an anti-clockwise direction.

Very useful information can be derived by examination and analysis of individual loops or series of loops, for example: 
* the horizontal distance between the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner of each loop is the [[stroke volume]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.uc.edu/kranias/cardiac_function.htm Diagram at uc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the line joining the top-left corner of several loops is the contractile or [[inotropic state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Heart%20Failure/HF005.htm Systolic dysfunction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Products of conception''', abbreviated '''POC''', is a medical term used for the tissue derived from the union of an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and a [[sperm]]. It encompasses [[anembryonic gestation]] (blighted ovum) which does not have a viable [[embryo]].

In the context of tissue from a [[dilation and curettage]], the presence of POC essentially excludes an [[ectopic pregnancy]].

==Retained products of conception==
''Retained products of conception'' is where products of conception remain in the uterus after [[childbirth]], [[medical abortion]] or [[Miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] (colloquially known as miscarriage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=19611 Definition: 'Retained Products Of Conception'] from MediLexicon. Retrieved Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Miscarriage with retained products of conception is termed ''delayed'' when no or very little products of conception have been passed, and ''incomplete'' when some products have been passed but some still remain ''[[in utero]]''.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchon|first=DJ|title=Missed abortion versus delayed miscarriage.|journal=British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=June 1997|volume=104|issue=6|pages=753|pmid=9197887|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11994.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, quantitative [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]], ultrasound, and pathologic evaluation. A solid, heterogeneous, echogenic mass has a positive predictive value of 80%, but is present in only a minority of cases. A thickened endometrium of &gt; 10&amp;nbsp;mm is usually considered abnormal, though no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoff. A cut-off of 8&amp;nbsp;mm or more has 34% positive rate, while a cut off of 14&amp;nbsp;mm or more has 85% sensitivity, 64% specificity for the diagnosis. Color Doppler flow in the endometrial canal can increased confidence in the diagnosis, though its absence does not exclude it, as 40% of cases of retained products have little or no flow. The differential in suspected cases includes uterine atony, blood clot, gestational trophoblastic disease, and normal post partum appearance of the uterus. Post partum blood clot is more common, reported in up to 24% of postpartum patients, and tends to be more hypoechoic than retained products with absent color flow on Doppler, and resolving spontaneously on follow up scans. The presence of gas raises the possibility of post partum endometritis, though this can also be seen in up to 21% of normal post pregnancy states. The normal post partum uterus is usually less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm in thickness, and continues to involute on follow up scans to 7&amp;nbsp;mm or less over time. Retained products are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, though it more common following abortions, either elective or spontaneous. There is significant overlap between appearance of a normal post partum uterus and retained products.  If there is no endometrial canal mass or fluid, and endometrial thickness is less than 10&amp;nbsp;mm and without increased flow, retained products are statistically unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=NK|last2=Kim|first2=S|last3=Lee|first3=JW|last4=Sol|first4=YL|last5=Kim|first5=CW|last6=Hyun Sung|first6=K|last7=Jang|first7=HJ|last8=Suh|first8=DS|title=Postpartum hemorrhage: Clinical and radiologic aspects.|journal=European journal of radiology|date=April 2010|volume=74|issue=1|pages=50–9|pmid=19477095|doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.04.062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolman|first1=I|last2=Altman|first2=E|last3=Faith|first3=G|last4=Har-Toov|first4=J|last5=Amster|first5=R|last6=Gull|first6=I|last7=Jaffa|first7=AJ|title=Combined clinical and ultrasonographic work-up for the diagnosis of retained products of conception.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=September 2009|volume=92|issue=3|pages=1162–4|pmid=19249022|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamaya|first1=A|last2=Ro|first2=K|last3=Benedetti|first3=NJ|last4=Chang|first4=PL|last5=Desser|first5=TS|title=Imaging and diagnosis of postpartum complications: sonography and other imaging modalities.|journal=Ultrasound quarterly|date=September 2009|volume=25|issue=3|pages=151–62|pmid=19730078|doi=10.1097/ruq.0b013e3181b5451e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===After medical abortion===
According to the 2006 WHO ''Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion'',&lt;ref name="WHO FAQs 2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=International Consensus Conference on Non-surgical (Medical) Abortion in Early First Trimester on Issues Related to Regimens and Service Delivery |year=2006 |title=Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=92-4-159484-5 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241594845_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of remaining products of conception in the uterus (as detected by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]) after a [[medical abortion]] is ''not'' an indication for surgical intervention (that is, [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[dilation and curettage]]). Remaining products of conception will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes [[anemia]], or if there is evidence of [[endometritis]].

===In delayed miscarriage===
In delayed miscarriage (also called missed abortion), the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:&lt;ref name=thewomens&gt;[http://www.thewomens.org.au/uploads/downloads/HealthProfessionals/CPGs/Miscarriage/CPGMiscarriageManagement_07102010.pdf Clinical Practice Guideline: Miscarriage: Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312134833/http://www.thewomens.org.au/uploads/downloads/HealthProfessionals/CPGs/Miscarriage/CPGMiscarriageManagement_07102010.pdf |date=2011-03-12 }} from [[Royal Women's Hospital]]. Publication date: 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gestational sac]] greater than 30-35mm, embryo larger than ~25mm (corresponding to 9+0 weeks of [[gestational age]]): Surgery is recommended. It poses a high risk of pain and bleeding with passage of products of conception. Alternative methods may still be considered.
* Gestational sac 15-35mm, embryo smaller than 25mm (corresponding to between 7 and 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Medication is recommended. Surgery or expectant management may be considered.
* Gestational sac smaller than 15-20mm, corresponding to a gestational age of less than 7 weeks: Expectant management or medication is preferable. The products of conception may be difficult to find surgically with a considerable risk of failed surgical procedure.

===In incomplete miscarriage===
In incomplete miscarriage, the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:&lt;ref name=thewomens/&gt;
* Retained products of conception smaller than 15mm: Expectant management is generally preferable. There is a high chance of spontaneous expulsion. 
* Retained products of conception measuring between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are recommended. Surgery should only be considered upon specific indication. 
* At retained products of conception measuring over 35 to 50mm, the following measures are recommended:
:*Administration of [[misoprostol]] to hasten passage of products of conception.
:*Admission to [[inpatient]] care for observation for a few hours or overnight until the majority of the products of conception has passed and bleeding subsided.
:*After apparent failure of misoprostol, a gynecologic examination should be done prior to considering surgical evacuation of the uterus or the patient leaving the

A '''quark–gluon plasma''' ('''QGP''') or '''quark soup'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1977NuPhB.128..275B|author1=Bohr, Henrik|author2=Nielsen, H.

This state is thought to consist of [[asymptotically free]] [[Strong force|strong-interacting]] [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s, which are ordinarily confined by [[color confinement]] inside atomic nuclei or other [[hadron]]s. This is in analogy with the conventional [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] where nuclei and electrons, confined inside [[atom]]s by [[electrostatic forces]] at ambient conditions, can move freely. Artificial quark matter, which has been produced at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven National Laboratory’s]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]], can only be produced in minute quantities and is unstable and impossible to contain, and will radioactively decay within a fraction of a second into stable particles through [[hadronization]]; the produced [[hadron]]s or their decay products and [[gamma ray]]s can then be detected. In the [[quark matter]] phase diagram, QGP is placed in the high-temperature, high-density regime, whereas ordinary matter is a cold and rarefied mixture of nuclei and vacuum, and the hypothetical [[quark star]]s would consist of relatively cold, but dense quark matter. It is believed that up to a few milliseconds after the Big Bang, known as the [[quark epoch]], the Universe was in a quark–gluon plasma state.

The strength of the [[color force]] means that unlike the gas-like [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], quark–gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal [[Fermi liquid]], although research on flow characteristics is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2005/apr/19/quark-gluon-plasma-goes-liquid |title=Quark-gluon plasma goes liquid |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=110303|title=BNL Newsroom {{!}} RHIC Scientists Serve Up 'Perfect' Liquid|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LHC's [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eleanor Imster |url=http://earthsky.org/human-world/lhc-creates-liquid-from-big-bang |title=LHC creates liquid from Big Bang &amp;#124; Human World |publisher=EarthSky |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; QGP differs from a "free" collision event by several features; for example, its particle content is indicative of a temporary [[chemical equilibrium]] producing an excess of middle-energy [[strange quark]]s vs. a nonequilibrium distribution mixing light and heavy quarks ("strangeness production"), and it does not allow [[Jet (particle physics)|particle jets]] to pass through ("jet quenching").

Experiments at [[CERN]]'s [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) first tried to create the QGP in the 1980s and 1990s: the results led CERN to announce indirect evidence for a "new state of matter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newstate-matter.web.cern.ch/newstate-matter/Experiments.html |title=A New State of Matter – Experiments |publisher=Newstate-matter.web.cern.ch |date=2000-02-04 |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000.

== General introduction ==

Quark–gluon plasma is a [[state of matter]] in which the elementary particles that make up the hadrons of [[baryon]]ic matter are freed of their [[Strong interaction|strong]] attraction for one another under extremely high [[Energy density|energy densities]]. These particles are the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s that compose baryonic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infocenter ILGTI: Indian Lattice Gauge Theory Initiative |url=http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/ilgti/infocenter/ |accessdate=May 20, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212185849/http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/ilgti/infocenter/ |archivedate=February 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal matter quarks are ''[[Color confinement|confined]]''; in the QGP quarks are ''[[Deconfinement|deconfined]]''. In classical QCD quarks are the [[fermion]]ic components of [[hadron]]s ([[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s) while the [[gluon]]s are considered the [[boson]]ic components of such particles.  The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.

Although the experimental high temperatures and densities predicted as producing a quark–gluon plasma have been realized in the laboratory, the resulting matter does ''not'' behave as a quasi-ideal state of free quarks and gluons, but, rather, as an almost perfect dense fluid.&lt;ref name=Zajc&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The fluid nature of quark-gluon plasma |author= WA Zajc |journal=Nuclear Physics A |year=2008 |volume=805 |issue= 1–4 |pages=283c–294c |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2008.02.285 |arxiv=0802.3552 |postscript=.|bibcode = 2008NuPhA.805..283Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, the fact that the quark–gluon plasma will not yet be "free" at temperatures realized at present accelerators was predicted in 1984 as a consequence of the remnant effects of confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=How free is the quark-gluon plasma |first=M. |last=Plümer |first2=S. |last2=Raha |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=R.

=== Relation to normal plasma ===

A [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  &lt;math&gt;Q \rightarrow Q e^{-r/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length α. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.

Because of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).

=== Theory ===

One consequence of this difference is that the [[color charge]] is too large for [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] computations which are the mainstay of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].&lt;ref name="Karsch"&gt;https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-lat/pdf/9503/9503010v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862–863 |issue=12 |pages=4-12 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.

=== Production ===

The QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a "fireball", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.

=== How the QGP fits into the general scheme of physics ===

[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent. Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.

The study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).

== Expected properties ==

=== Thermodynamics ===
The cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This "crossover" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.

=== Flow ===
The equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.

=== Excitation spectrum ===
The study of thermodynamic and flow properties indicate that the assumption of QGP consisting almost entirely of free quarks and gluons is an over-simplification. Many ideas are currently being developed and will be put to test in the near future. It has been hypothesized recently that some mesons built from heavy quarks do not dissolve until the temperature reaches about {{val|350|u=MeV}}. This has led to speculation that many other kinds of bound states may exist in the plasma. Some static properties of the plasma (similar to the [[Debye length|Debye screening length]]) constrain the excitation spectrum.

=== Glasma hypothesis ===
Since 2008, there is a discussion about a hypothetical precursor state of the Quark–gluon plasma, the so-called "Glasma", where the dressed particles are condensed into some kind of glassy (or amorphous) state, below the genuine transition between the confined state and the plasma liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=From Glasma to Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions |year=2008 |arxiv=0806.1356 |bibcode = 2008JPhG...35j4003V |doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/35/10/104003 |volume=35 |issue=10 |journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics |page=104003|last1=Venugopalan |first1=Raju }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be analogous to the formation of metallic glasses, or amorphous alloys of them, below the genuine onset of the liquid metallic state.

== Experimental situation ==
Those forms of the QGP that are easiest to compute are not those that are easiest to verify experimentally. While the balance of evidence points towards the QGP being the origin of the detailed properties of the fireball produced at [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] (CERN), in the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] and at [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], this is the main barrier which prevents experimentalists from declaring a sighting of the QGP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnl.gov/npp/docs/Hunting%20the%20QGP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The important classes of experimental observations are
* [[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)
* [[Strangeness production]]
* [[Photon and muon rates]] (and [[J/ψ#J/ψ melting|J/ψ melting]])
* [[Elliptic flow]]
* [[Jet quenching]]
* [[Quantum fluctuation|Fluctuations]]
* [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose–Einstein correlations]]

In short, a quark–gluon plasma flows like a splat of liquid, and because it's not "transparent" with respect to quarks, it can attenuate [[Jet (particle physics)|jets]] emitted by collisions. Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark–gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.

== Formation of quark matter ==
In April 2005, formation of quark matter was tentatively confirmed by results obtained at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]'s [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC). The consensus of the four RHIC research groups was that they had created a quark–gluon [[liquid]] of very low [[viscosity]]. However, contrary to what was at that time still the widespread assumption, it is yet unknown from theoretical predictions whether the QCD "plasma", especially close to the transition temperature, should behave like a gas or liquid.  Authors favoring the weakly interacting interpretation derive their assumptions from the lattice QCD calculation, where the entropy density of quark–gluon plasma approaches the weakly interacting limit. However, since both energy density and correlation shows significant deviation from the weakly interacting limit, it has been pointed out by many authors that there is in fact no reason to assume a QCD "plasma" close to the transition point should be weakly interacting, like electromagnetic plasma (see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=nucl-th/0403032 |author1=Miklos Gyulassy |title=The QGP Discovered at RHIC |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  That being said, systematically improvable perturbative QCD quasiparticle models do a very good job of reproducing the lattice data for thermodynamical observables (pressure, entropy, quark susceptibility), including the aforementioned "significant deviation from the weakly interacting limit", down to temperatures on the order of 2 to 3 times the critical temperature for the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Andersen | author2=Leganger | author3=Strickland | author4=Su | doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.12.070 | journal=Physics Letters B |volume=696|title=NNLO hard-thermal-loop thermodynamics for QCD |year=2011 |arxiv=1009.4644 |bibcode= 2011PhLB..696..468A | issue=5 | pages=468–472 | citeseerx=10.1.1.766.4960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andersen |author2=Michael Strickland |author3=Nan Su |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.122003 |pmid=20366527 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |title=Gluon Thermodynamics at Intermediate Coupling |issue=12 |pages=122003 |year=2010 |arxiv=0911.0676|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104l2003A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |arxiv=hep-ph/0303185 |author1=Blaizot |author2=Iancu |author3=Rebhan |title=Thermodynamics of the high-temperature quark-gluon plasma |year=2003 |doi=10.1142/9789812795533_0002 |journal=Quark–Gluon Plasma 3 |pages=60–122|isbn=978-981-238-077-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[iron meteorite]] fell on the '''Sikhote-Alin Mountains''', in southeastern Russia, in 1947. Though large iron meteorite falls had been witnessed previously and fragments recovered, never before in [[recorded history]] had a fall of this magnitude been observed.&lt;ref name="rocks"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.

== Impact ==
[[Image:Sikhote-Alin stamp 1957.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The 10th anniversary stamp. It reproduces a painting by P. J. Medvedev.]]
At around 10:30 on 12 February 1947, eyewitnesses in the [[Sikhote-Alin Mountains]], [[Primorsky Krai|Primorye]], Soviet Union, observed a large [[bolide]] brighter than the [[sun]] that came out of the north and descended at an angle of about 41 degrees. The bright flash and the deafening sound of the fall were observed for {{convert|300|km|mi}} around the point of impact not far from [[Luchegorsk]] and approximately {{convert|440|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vladivostok]]. A smoke trail, estimated at {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, remained in the sky for several hours.

As the meteor, traveling at a speed of about {{convert|14|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}, entered the atmosphere, it began to break apart, and the fragments fell together. At an altitude of about {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the largest mass apparently broke up in a violent explosion called an [[air burst]].

On November 20, 1957&lt;ref name="stamps"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pibburns.com/catastro/metstamp.htm | title=Meteorite Stamps and Coins | first=Philip R. "Pib" | last=Burns | work= | publisher= | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000121235534/http://www.pibburns.com/catastro/metstamp.htm | archivedate=2000-01-21 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]] issued a stamp for the 10th anniversary of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower. It reproduces a painting by [[Pyotr Ivanovich Medvedev|P. I. Medvedev]], a Soviet artist who witnessed the fall: he was sitting in his window starting a sketch when the fireball appeared, so he immediately began drawing what he saw.&lt;ref name="montreal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planetarium.montreal.qc.ca/Information/Expo_Meteorites/Vedettes/sikhotealin_a.html | title=Sikhote Alin | publisher=[[Planetarium de Montreal]] | work= | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521024636/http://www.planetarium.montreal.qc.ca/Information/Expo_Meteorites/Vedettes/sikhotealin_a.html | archivedate=2006-05-21 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbit ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Because the [[meteor]] fell during daytime, it was observed by many eyewitnesses. Evaluation of this observational data allowed [[V. G. Fesenkov]], then chairman of the meteorite committee of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Science]], to estimate the [[meteoroid|meteoroid's]] [[orbit]] before it encountered the Earth. This orbit was [[ellipse]]-shaped, with its point of greatest distance from the [[sun]] situated within the [[asteroid belt]], similar to many other small bodies crossing the orbit of the Earth. Such an orbit was probably created by collisions within the asteroid belt.

== Size ==
Sikhote-Alin is a massive fall with the overall size of the [[meteoroid]] estimated at approximately {{convert|90000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  A more recent estimate by Tsvetkov (and others) puts the mass at around {{convert|100000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="metmag"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://meteoritemag.uark.edu/604.htm |journal=Meteorite Magazine | date=February 1996 |publisher=Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, University of Arkansas |title=Sikhote-Alin Revisited |first=Roy |last=Gallant |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144717/http://meteoritemag.uark.edu/604.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krinov had estimated the post-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid at some {{convert|23000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

== Strewn field and craters ==
The [[strewn field]] for this meteorite covered an elliptical area of about {{convert|1.3|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Some of the fragments made [[impact craters]], the largest of which was about {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="eidb"&gt;{{cite Earth Impact DB | name=Sikhote-Alin | accessdate=2009-08-19 }} {{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of the meteorite were also driven into the surrounding trees.

== Composition and classification ==
[[File:Sikhote alin.jpg|thumb|200px|Section]]
The Sikhote-Alin meteorite is classified as an [[iron meteorite]] belonging to the meteorite group [[IIAB meteorites|IIAB]] and with a coarse [[octahedrite]] structure. It is composed of approximately 93% [[iron]], 5.9% [[nickel]], 0.42% [[cobalt]], 0.46% [[phosphorus]], and 0.28% [[sulfur]], with trace amounts of [[germanium]] and [[iridium]]. Minerals present include [[taenite]], [[plessite]], [[troilite]], [[chromite]], [[kamacite]], and [[schreibersite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HANDBOOK OF IRON METEORITES Their History, Distribution, Composition and Structure|last=Buchwald|first=Vagn F.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1975|isbn=|location=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/36040|pages=Vol 3, Pages 1123–1130|quote=Group lIB. 5.90% Ni, 0.42% Co, 0.46% P, 0.28% S, 52 ppm Ga, 161 ppm Ge , 0.03 ppm Jr.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specimens==
Specimens of the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite are basically of two types:&lt;ref name="metmag" /&gt;
#''individual'', [[glossary of meteoritics#Regmaglypts|''thumbprinted'' or ''regmaglypted specimens'']], showing fusion crust and signs of atmospheric [[ablation]]
#''shrapnel'' or ''fragmented specimens'', sharp-edged pieces of torn metal showing evidence of violent fragmentation
The first type probably broke off the main object early in the descent. These pieces are characterized by regmaglypts (cavities resembling thumb prints) in the surface of each specimen. The second type are fragments which were either torn apart during the atmospheric explosions or blasted apart upon impact on the frozen ground. Most were probably the result of the explosion at {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude.

A large specimen is on display in [[Moscow]]. Many other specimens are held by [[Russian Academy of Science]] and a great number of smaller specimens have made their way into the collector's market.

A '''super-spreader''' is a host—an organism [[infection|infected]] with a [[pathogen|disease]]—that infects, disproportionally, more secondary contacts than other hosts who are, also, infected with the same disease.  A sick human can be a super-spreader; they would be more likely to infect others than most people with the disease.  Super-spreaders are thus of high concern in [[epidemiology]] (the study of the spread of diseases).

Some cases of super-spreading conform to the [[20/80 rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galvani | first1 = Alison P. | last2 = May | first2 = Robert M. | title = Epidemiology: Dimensions of superspreading | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 293–295 | pmid = 16292292 | doi=10.1038/438293a}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, approximately, 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd-Smith | first1 = JO | last2 = Schreiber | first2 = SJ | last3 = Kopp | first3 = PE | last4 = Getz | first4 = WM | year = 2005 | title = Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 355–359 | doi = 10.1038/nature04153 | pmid=16292310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[epidemic]]s with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few [[contact tracing|secondary contacts]].

Super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including a decline in [[herd immunity]], [[nosocomial infection]]s, [[virulence]], [[viral load]], [[misdiagnosis]], [[Droplet infection|airflow dynamics]], [[immune suppression]], and [[co-infection]] with another [[pathogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = Richard A. | year = 2011 | title = Superspreaders in Infectious Disease | url = | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 510–513 | pmid = 21737332 | doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining a super-spreading event==
Although loose definitions of super-spreading exist, some effort has been made at defining what qualifies as a super-spreading event (SSE) more explicit. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) define a protocol to identify a super-spreading event as follows:&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;
# estimate the effective reproductive number, ''R'', for the disease and population in question;
# construct a [[Poisson distribution]] with mean ''R'', representing the expected range of ''Z'' due to [[stochasticity]] without individual variation;
# define an SSE as any infected person who infects more than ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; others'', where ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the nth percentile of the Poisson(''R'') distribution.

This protocol defines a 99th-percentile SSE as a case which causes more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;

During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Beijing, China, epidemiologists defined a super-spreader as an individual with transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Shen, F. Ning, W. Zhou, L.He, C. Lin, D. Chin, Z. Zhus, A. Schuchat. Superspreading events, Beijing, 2003. Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vol. 10, No. 2. Feb. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Super-spreaders may or may not show any symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Richard A.|title=Super-spreaders in infectious diseases|journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases|date=August 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e510-e513|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020|pmid=21737332| quote=The minority of individuals who infect disproportionately more susceptible contacts, as compared to most individuals who infect few or no others, became known as super-spreaders, and their existence is deeply rooted in history: between 1900 and 1907, Typhoid Mary infected 51 individuals, three of whom died, even though she only had an asymptomatic infection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cory|first=David C. Wiley, Amy C.|title=Encyclopedia of School Health|date=2013|publisher=SAGE|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=9781412996006 |quote=Historically, one of the most famous examples of super-spreading was that of Mary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, who infected many contacts, several of whom died, through food she prepared and consequently contaminated, even thought she did not show symptoms. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors in transmission==
[[Image:Herd_immunity.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|How an infection spreads in a community with immunized and non-immunized members.]]
Super-spreaders have been identified who excrete a higher than normal number of pathogens during the time they are infectious. This causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viral/bacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-superspreaders with the same duration of exposure.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J.

===Basic reproductive number===
The [[basic reproduction number]] R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[statistical mean|average]] number of secondary infections caused by a typical infective person in a totally susceptible population.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galvani|first=Alison P.|author2=Robert M. |title=Epidemiology: Dimensions of super-spreading|journal=Nature|date=17 November 2005|volume=438|issue=7066|pages=239–295|doi=10.1038/438293a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/438293a.html|accessdate=18 April 2014|pmid=16292292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reproductive number is found by multiplying the average number of contacts by the average probability that a susceptible individual will become infected, which is called the shedding potential. &lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Number of contacts X Shedding potential &lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Individual reproductive number===
The individual reproductive number represents the number of secondary infections caused by a specific individual during the time that individual is infectious. Some individuals have significantly higher than average individual reproductive numbers and are known as super-spreaders. Through [[contact tracing]], epidemiologists have identified super-spreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever and SARS.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Serres | first1 = G | last2 = Markowski | first2 = F | last3 = Toth | first3 = E | last4 = Landry | first4 = M | last5 = Auger | first5 = D | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade–Quebec, Canada, 2011: contribution of susceptibility, serendipity, and superspreading events | url = | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 990–998 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jis923 | pmid=23264672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-infections with other pathogens===
Men with HIV who were co-infected with at least one other sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex 2 virus, were found to have an eight-fold higher HIV shedding rate than men without co-infection. This shedding rate was calculated in men with similar HIV viral loads. Once treatment for the co-infection had been completed, the HIV shedding rate returned to levels comparable to men without co-infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = M.S.

===Lack of herd immunity===
[[Herd immunity]], or herd effect, refers to the indirect protection that immunized community members provide to non-immunized members in preventing the spread of contagious disease. The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a ''dependent happening'' because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J. Rothman 2008. page 561"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine P 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = P | year = 1993 | title = Herd immunity: history, theory, practice | url = | journal = Epidemiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 265–302 | pmid = 8174658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the ''herd immunity threshold''. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR |title=Priorities in Health: Disease Control Priorities Companion Volume |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=2006  |chapter=Chapter 4: Cost-Effective Strategies for the Excess Burden of Disease in Developing Countries&lt;br/&gt;Section: Vaccine-preventable Diseases |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10258/#A151 |isbn=0-8213-6260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that an outbreak can't occur, but it will be limited.

== Super-spreaders during outbreaks ==

===SARS outbreak 2003===
[[File:Guangdong in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Guangdong Province in Southeastern China where the first outbreak of SARS occurred in 2003.]]
The first cases of [[SARS]] occurred in mid-November 2002 in the [[Guangdong]] Province of China. This was followed by an outbreak in [[Hong Kong]] in February, 2003. A Guangdong Province doctor, Liu Jianlun, who had treated SARS cases there, had contracted the virus and was symptomatic. Despite his symptoms, he traveled to Hong Kong to attend a family wedding. He stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in [[Kowloon]], infecting 16 other hotel guests also staying on that floor (pictured above). The guests then traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, spreading SARS to those locations and transmitting what became a global epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |title=How SARS changed the world in less than six months|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405125444/http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case during this same outbreak, a 54-year-old male was admitted to a hospital with coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure and type two diabetes. He had been in contact with a patient known to have SARS. Shortly after his admission he developed fever, cough, myalgia and sore throat. The admitting physician suspected SARS. The patient was transferred to another hospital for treatment of his coronary artery disease. While there, his SARS symptoms became more pronounced. Later, it was discovered he had transmitted SARS to 33 other patients in just two days. He was transferred back to the original hospital where he died of SARS.

The SARS pandemic was eventually contained, but not before it caused 8,273 cases and 775 deaths. Within two weeks of the original outbreak in Guangdong Province, SARS had spread to 37 countries.&lt;ref name=ncbi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Zhuang|author2=Fang Ning |title=Superspreading SARS Events, Beijing 2003|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=February 2004|volume=10|issue=2|pages=256–260|doi=10.3201/eid1002.030732|pmid=15030693|pmc=3322930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles outbreak 1989===
[[File:Measles vaccination coverage world.svg|thumb|Rates of measles vaccination worldwide]]
Measles is a highly contagious, air-borne virus that reappears even among vaccinated populations. In one Finnish town in 1989, an explosive school-based outbreak resulted in 51 cases, several of whom had been previously vaccinated. One child alone, infected 22 others. It was noted during this outbreak that when vaccinated siblings shared a bedroom with an infected sibling, seven out of nine became infected as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paunio | first1 = Mikko | last2 = Peltola | first2 = Heikki | last3 = Davidkin | first3 = Irja | last4 = Virtanen | first4 = Martti | last5 = Heinonen | first5 = Olli P. | last6 = Valle | first6 = Martti | year = 1998 | title = Explosive School-based Measles Outbreak Intense Exposure May Have Resulted in High Risk, Even among Revaccinees | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 148 | issue = | pages = 1103–10 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typhoid fever===
[[File:Riverside Hospital North Brother Island crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, where Mary Mallon, aka Typhoid Mary, was involuntarily quarantined. 2006.]]
[[Typhoid fever]] is a human-specific disease caused by the bacterium   ''[[Salmonella typhi]]''. It is highly contagious and becoming resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Highfield|title=Typhoid is with us to stay|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=28 November 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3345526/Typhoid-is-with-us-to-stay.html|accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. typhi is susceptible to creating [[asymptomatic carrier]]s. The most famous carriers are [[Mary Mallon]], known as Typhoid Mary, from New York City, and Mr. N. the Milker, from Folkstone, England.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, PP. Mr. N. the Milker and Dr. Koch's concept of the healthy carrier. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1354-1356.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were active around the same time. Mallon infected 51 people from 1902 to 1909. Mr. N. infected more than 200 people over 14 years from 1901 to 1915. At the request of health officials, Mr. N. gave up working in food service. Mallon refused to give up working in food service and eventually was involuntarily quarantined at [[North and South Brother Islands, East River|Brothers Island]] in New York, where she stayed until she died in November 1938, aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J. Typhoid Mary. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1714&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that ''Salmonella typhi'' persists in infected mice macrophages that have cycled from an inflammatory state to a non-inflammatory state. The bacteria remain and reproduce without causing further symptoms in the mice, and that this explains why carriers are asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;TM, Ng, DM Monack.

'''''Synopses of the British Fauna''''' is a series of identification guides, published by [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] and [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]]. Each volume in the series provides and in-depth analysis of a group of animals and is designed to bridge the gap between the standard [[field guide]] and more specialised [[monograph]] or [[treatise]]. The series is now published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] on behalf of The Linnean Society and The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association. 

The series is designed for use in the field and is kept as user friendly as possible with [[technical terminology]] kept to a minimum and a glossary of terms provided, although the complexity of the subject matter makes the books more suitable for the more experienced practitioner.

[[File:Sea Spiders.gif|right|frame|Cover of Sea-Spiders (2010)]]

== History of the series ==

On 11 March 1943, at a meeting of [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] in Burlington House, TH Savoy presented his "Synopsis of the Opiliones" (Harvestmen). It was so well received that a decision was made there and then to publish it as the first of a series of "ecological fauna lists".

Re-launched by Dr Doris Kermack in the mid-1960s, the New Series of ''Synopses of the British Fauna'' went from strength to strength. From number 13, the series had been jointly sponsored by [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]] and Dr RSK Barnes became co-editor.

From 1993, the series has been published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] and benefits from association with the extensive testing undertaken as part of the [[AIDGAP]] project.

== Volumes ==

The series contains the following volumes, many of which are out of print. Many of the volumes have been updated and reprinted under slightly different names to reflect either [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] changes or advances in the understanding of a group.

The '''turnoff point''' for a [[star]] refers to the point on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] where it leaves the [[main sequence]] after the exhaustion of its main fuel.  It is often referred to as the '''main sequence turnoff'''.

By plotting the turnoff point of the stars in [[star clusters]], one can estimate the cluster's age.

==Stars with no turnoff point==
[[Red dwarfs]] are stars of 0.08-0.4 solar masses and are also referred to as class M stars.  Red dwarfs have sufficient [[hydrogen]] mass to sustain hydrogen [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] to [[helium]] via the [[proton-proton chain reaction]], but do not have sufficient mass to create the temperatures and pressures necessary to fuse helium to [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]] (see [[CNO cycle]]).  However, all their hydrogen is available for fusion, and the low temperatures and pressures mean the lifetimes of these stars on the main sequence from zero point to turn off point is measured in trillions of years.  For example, the lifespan of a star of 0.1 solar masses is 6 trillion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Iliadis | first = Christian | title = Nuclear Physics of Stars | publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]] | location = Weinheim | date = 2007 | isbn = 3-527-40602-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lifespan greatly exceeds the current age of the [[universe]], therefore all red dwarfs are main sequence stars.  Even though extremely long lived, those stars will eventually run out of fuel.  Once all of the available hydrogen has been fused [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] stops and the remaining heated helium slowly cools by [[radiation]].  [[Gravity]] will contract the star from lack of expansive pressure from fusion until [[electron degeneracy pressure]] compensates.  The cooling star is now off the main sequence and is known as a helium [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seeds | first = Michael | title = Horizons | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | location = Australia | date = 2006 | isbn = 0-495-01003-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5169">'''Vineyard Power Co-operative''' is "a community owned renewable energy co-operative based on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&amp;UpdateAllowed=&amp;FEIN=001016176 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts William Francis Galvin - Public Browse and Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vineyardpower.com/ Vineyard Power Cooperative | A Community-Owned Energy Cooperative On Martha's Vineyard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vineyard Power develops local renewable energy projects and plans to assist the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] to meet the energy goals of the Island Plan, and work towards a 100% renewable energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islandplan.org Island Plan: The Island Plan - Moving Towards Implementation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of Vineyard Power was inspired by the renewable energy vision of the people of Samso island in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2010/02/19/vision-true-vineyard-energy-independence&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Wind Power==
Offshore wind development is another of the motivations for creating the Vineyard Power Co-op, with the recognition this energy source would need community support. The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) classifies the sound and ocean around Martha's Vineyard to be "Excellent" (between 7.5 and 8 meters per second (m/s) in regard to energy generation potential, at 50 meters altitude) or "Outstanding" (between 8.0 and 8.8 m/s).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/40745.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first proposal for offshore wind in the area, known as Cape Wind, created significant opposition focused on the lack of community involvement, and visual impacts. https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2011/1437.html That project obtained a lease for development in Federal waters six miles from land in Nantucket Sound. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.boem.gov/Massachusetts-Cape-Wind/ &lt;/ref&gt;

Vineyard Power organized public input into the planning wind farm development off the southern shores of the island,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechargenews.com/hardcopy/article263967.ece Tiny developer has big plans off Massachusetts - Hardcopy - Renewable energy news - Recharge - wind, solar, biomass, wave/tidal/hydro and geothermal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with [http://www.offshoremwllc.com OffshoreMW], and [http://www.boem.gov Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE)].  This collaboration began as the Martha's Vineyard Offshore Wind Alliance (MVOWA) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvgazette.com/article.php?29792 Vineyard Power Cooperative Joins Partner in Bid on Wind - 4/29/11 - Vineyard Gazette Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vineyard Power Co-op signed a Community Benefits Agreement with that one developer to formalize this arrangement for mutual benefit, and to pursue better community input and economic development for the people of Martha's Vineyard. The development is now called Vineyard Wind.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vineyardwind.com/in-your-community-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The permitting process for this offshore windfarm is underway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boem.gov/Vineyard-Wind/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar Power==

During the years when the Federal process for offshore wind development moved slowly, the Co-op identified opportunities to develop solar projects on the island. The first of these were solar canopies in the parking lot at the locally-owned supermaket. Benefits for more citizens came through building solar on town-owned landfills. Town of Aquinnah chose the company, after an RFP, for a solar plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvtimes.com/2011/12/08/aquinnah-voters-approve-solar-array-town-landfill-8735/ Aquinnah voters approve solar array at town landfill : The Martha's Vineyard Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction was started and completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvgazette.com/article.php?34565 Solar Project Gets Early Green Light - 3/30/12 - Vineyard Gazette Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent solar project completed is on the roof of the Boys and Girls Club.&lt;ref&gt;https://us.sunpower.com/blog/2017/04/12/celebrate-earth-month-marthas-vineyard-sustainable-living-community/&lt;/ref&gt;

==100% Renewable Energy==
The Co-op promotes planning and practices that reduce fossil fuel use and the replacement with renewable electricity. The first solar canopies built by the Co-op include electric vehicle chargers. The Co-op continues to support electric vehicle adoption.  Leaders of island organizations met in September 2017 at the initiative of the Co-op and Environment Massachusetts to develop a vision of 100% renewable energy use for the island.&lt;ref&gt;https://calendar.vineyardgazette.com/event/vineyard_power_8th_annual_member_meeting#.Wu8UpNPwau4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vintage amateur radio''' is a subset of [[amateur radio]] activity and is considered a form of [[nostalgia]] or hobby much like antique car collecting, where enthusiasts collect, restore, preserve, build, and operate amateur radio equipment from bygone years, most notably those using [[vacuum tube]] technology.&lt;ref name="Haring"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haring|first=Kristen |title=Ham radio's technical culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ly7rDKeGZsC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Kristen+Haring+vintage&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MOccTBqB-_AG-qKwtww&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 19, 2010|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08355-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular modes of operation include voice communication using [[amplitude modulation]] (AM), and [[Morse code]] using [[continuous wave]] (CW) [[radiotelegraphy]]. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as [[Amateur radio homebrew|homebrewing]], using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.

== Appeal ==
Many amateurs prefer the relatively precise digital frequency displays and stability of modern, state-of-the-art, [[microprocessor]] based amateur radios. Vintage radio enthusiasts contend that modern amateur equipment lacks the aesthetic appeal and "soul" of amateur electronic gear from the vacuum tube era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virhistory.com/ham/rrab.faq.htm#why |title=Why Boatanchors? by John Brewer WB5OAU |publisher=Virhistory.com |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many find satisfaction in taking commercially-made amateur equipment from the 1930s-1970s (affectionately called [[Boat anchor (metaphor)|boat anchor]]s by US amateurs&lt;ref name="Boatanchors FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac6v.com/73.htm#ba |title=Origins Of Hamspeak |publisher=Ac6v.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their large size and weight) and carefully restoring it.&lt;ref name="Haring" /&gt;
 
[[File:Dial.png|thumb|right|[[Hallicrafters SX-28]] tuning dial]]
[[File:N3wwl.ogg|thumb|right|Audio recording of voice transmission by amateur station N3WWL using vacuum tube gear]]
Enthusiasts feel that the spacious electrical and mechanical designs of boat anchor radios are more easily worked on than the miniaturized layouts of modern Japanese gear. Fixing a modern transceiver often involves nothing more than a [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI chip]] replacement. Vintage amateur radio devotees enjoy the more primitive experience that boat anchor radios offer, calling it "real radio". Enthusiasts claim that boat anchors sound better than modern equipment, saying that the [[Valve sound|tube audio]] from vintage gear is "warmer" and more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Boatanchors FAQ"&gt;[http://www.virhistory.com/ham/rrab.faq.htm Boatanchors FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some hobbyists see vintage radio operation as a valuable asset to help preserve the history and heritage of radio for future generations, and may assist in the restoration and operation of vintage radio equipment for historical exhibits, museums and museum ships.

== AM activity ==
[[File:Wb6acu.png|thumb|left|"AM'er" [[Joe Walsh]] WB6ACU on the air]]
[[File:WB6ACU.ogg|thumb|left| Audio recording of Joe Walsh on the air]]
Amplitude modulation (AM) was once the main voice mode in amateur radio before being superseded by [[Single-sideband modulation]] (SSB). But AM has recently become a nostalgic specialty interest on the [[shortwave]] ham bands. Vintage radio operation has drawn a wide range of amateur radio enthusiasts from rock star [[Joe Walsh]], WB6ACU, to former [[Federal Communications Commission]] attorney Riley Hollingsworth, K4ZDH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eham.net/articles/2970, "Hollingsworth Era" of Amateur Enforcement Enters Fourth Year ""I am proud of the Amateur Service." Riley Hollingsworth, K4ZDH, at home in his well-equipped basement ham shack. Hollingsworth's gear includes several "vintage" operating positions." Source: The ARRL Letter Vol. 20, No. 49 December 14, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
A majority of "AM'ers" stations consist of vintage transmitters and receivers housed in separate cabinets. Some operators have even obtained old [[AM broadcast]] transmitters from radio stations that have upgraded their equipment. Others build their equipment from scratch (called [[Amateur radio homebrew|homebrewing]]) using both modern and vintage-era components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/3760 |title=Radio World Online |publisher=Radioworld.com |date=2001-06-20 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901124002/http://www.radioworld.com/article/3760 |archive-date=2010-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, amateur radio AM activity  can be found on mediumwave, [[Medium frequency|MF]]  and   shortwave, [[High frequency|HF]] [[frequencies]] (in [[Hertz|MHz]]) which   include ''1.885, 1.930, 1.985, 3.870-3.885, 7.290-7.295, 7.160, 14.286, 14.330, 21.425, and 29.000-29.200,'' and sometimes feature "special event" stations using unique [[call sign]]s. In the United Kingdom, AM activity can be found almost every day on frequencies between ''3.615'' and ''3.625'' MHz. The French AM activity can be found almost every day the morning between 6h30 and 8h00 the frequency ''3.550'' MHz.  In Australia, AM activity can be found most days on "7.125" MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Bande des 80 mètres|AM activity frequency ''3.550'' MHz]]&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, AM nets are conducted on Friday evenings on 3.850&amp;nbsp;MHz at 8:00 pm or 8.30 pm, and on Sunday and Wednesday afternoons on 7.125&amp;nbsp;MHz at 4:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzart.org.nz/join/spam/|title=Society For The Preservation Of Amplitude Modulation|date=11 April 2016|publisher=New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversations ([[Q code|QSO's]] in ham [[slang]]) are typically configured as "roundtables" consisting of several participants. Interested newcomers are usually encouraged to switch their modern [[transceiver]]s to AM mode, introduce themselves, and join the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/9302043.pdf ARRL QST article: Classic Rigs And Amplitude Modulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classic gear ==

[[File:Atlas210x.png|thumb|left|Atlas 215X solid state [[transceiver]] circa 1977]]
Vintage operating activity is not limited to the AM mode. Many devotees use their "classic" amateur gear from vintage-era American manufacturers like [[Eico]], [[E.F. Johnson Company|EF Johnson]], [[National Radio Company|National]], [[Heathkit]], [[Hammarlund]], [[R. L. Drake Company|Drake]], [[Collins Radio|Collins]], [[World Radio Laboratories|WRL]], [[Swan electronics|Swan]], [[Signal/One]], [[Lafayette Radio|Lafayette]] and [[Hallicrafters]], to make radiotelegraphy (CW), [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]], [[frequency modulation|FM]] and [[RTTY]] two-way contacts. Although 1930s through 1970s gear is considered "vintage", collectors may differ on the cutoff dates.&lt;ref name="Arland2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Arland|title=ARRL's Low Power Communication: The Art and Science of Qrp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVpoihOUjNgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA3|date=16 August 2007|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-104-2|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some even sub-specialize in [[military radio]] collecting and undertake to restore and operate surplus communications equipment, much of it dating back to [[World War II]], from the ubiquitous [[AN/ARC-5]] command sets and [[United States Army Signal Corps|US Signal Corps]] [[SCR-300]] and [[SCR-536]] [[walkie talkie]]s to exotic gear like the British [[Paraset]], a small [[espionage]] transceiver supplied to Resistance forces in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Arland2007" /&gt;

[[File:Eddystone.png|thumb|left|Eddystone EC10 shortwave receiver circa 1967]]
There is considerable interest in vintage military and commercial radio equipment among [[European Union|EU]] amateur radio operators, especially gear from British manufacturers such as [[Marconi Company|Marconi]], [[Racal]], [[Eddystone Radio|Eddystone]], [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]], and a variety of Russian, German, Canadian, British [[RAF]] and [[British Army]] equipment, such as the well known [[Wireless Set No. 19]].

=== Glowbugs ===
[[File:Ai2q.png|thumb|right|upright|Glowbug transmitter hand built by AI2Q]]
"Glowbugs" are a related aspect of vintage radio and harken back to the early days of amateur radio, when the majority of hams hand-crafted their own equipment. Smaller in size than "boat anchors", "glowbug" is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home-made tube-type radio set, reminiscent of the shortwave radio-building craze of the 1920s and 1930s. "Glow" refers to the glow of the vacuum tubes and "bug" to the gear's relatively diminutive size. The Doerle [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative]] receiver and [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]] transmitter circuits are considered "classic" glowbug designs. Generally, any small, home-built tube-type transmitter or receiver may be referred to as a glowbug. The majority of glowbug transmitters are designed to be used in the CW radiotelegraphy mode.

As late as the 1960s, glowbugs were part of many beginner ham stations, and the ARRL Radio Amateur Handbook for those years exhibited a number of such simple, tube-based designs. Today, glowbug operators are enjoying a resurgence of interest among [[QRP operation|QRP]] enthusiasts and others with a penchant for constructing their own equipment. Many hams are assembling "glowbug rigs" on improvised chassis such as tin cakepans and wooden boards, and putting them on the air between 7040 – 7050&amp;nbsp;kHz and 7114 – 7125&amp;nbsp;kHz. Amateur radio Glowbug enthusiasts can often be heard communicating on the shortwave bands via CW using [[Morse code]]. Popular frequencies to hear glowbug contacts are around 3560&amp;nbsp;kHz and also 3579.5&amp;nbsp;kHz, chosen because [[crystal oscillator|crystals]] for this frequency can be salvaged from discarded color TV sets, along with other transmitter components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol09/?pg=141&amp;search=tv+set+color+burst+crystals&amp;u1=texterity&amp;cookies=1 |title='&amp;#39;TV Set Salvage'&amp;#39; by ThomasArey |publisher=Make-digital.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webhome.idirect.com/~griffith/gb.htm |title=Glowbugs resources |publisher=Webhome.idirect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clubs, events, and publications ==
[[File:W6om.png|thumb|left|Vintage gear at station W6OM]]
Many vintage radio clubs sponsor special events and contests, such as the "AM QSO Party" sponsored by the ''Antique Wireless Association'', the "Heavy Metal Rally" sponsored by ''Electric Radio Magazine'', and the "Classic Radio Exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qsl.asti.com/CX/ |title=Classic Exchange |publisher=Qsl.asti.com |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such operating events are not traditional ham radio contests inasmuch as they are a night of friendly QSO’s using home-built, restored commercial ham, broadcast or military equipment.

''The Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society'' and ''The AM Radio Network's''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amfone.net/amradionetwork/index.htm |title=AM Radio Network |publisher=Amfone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Expedition to Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse" in Chesapeake Bay, MD commemorated the history of lighthouses with a vintage special event station using the call sign K3L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amfone.net/K3L/ |title=K3L information |publisher=Amfone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's ''Vintage and Military Amateur Radio Society'' (affiliated with the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]]) coordinates regular on-air "nets" where enthusiasts gather as well as massive technical files for the benefit of members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmars.org.uk/ Vintage Military Radio Society]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Surplus Radio Society'', a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] society of collectors of old ex-military radio equipment and other nostalgic receivers and transmitters holds weekly radio activity nets every Sunday on 3.575&amp;nbsp;MHz CW / 3.705&amp;nbsp;MHz AM and sponsors several [[flea markets]] and exchange fairs each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~srsnl/ |title=Surplus Radio Society |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members are Amateur Radio operators who use the equipment for on-air contacts with others.

The [[ARRL]] publishes "Vintage Radio", a collection of articles from [[QST]] magazine describing vintage equipment and restoration, and [[CQ Amateur Radio]] magazine releases a yearly "Classic Radio Calendar" featuring full-color vintage radio images.

The Antique Wireless Association of [[Southern Africa]] is devoted to the "maintenance and preservation of our amateur heritage" for enthusiasts of older types of short wave radios and amateur equipment, and maintains a museum exhibit in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name="CVRS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=R|url=https://canadianvintageradio.com/reciprocallinks/antique-wireless-association-of-south-africa|title=Canadian Vintage Radio Society|publisher=CVRS|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antique Wireless Association of Southern Africa|url=http://www.awasa.org.za/|website=Z50AWA|publisher=AWASA|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
[[File:Radioshack.jpg|right|thumb|Collins S-Line, featuring separate transmitter, receiver and power supply]]
[[File:6146B tube.JPG|right|thumb|6146B transmitting tubes]]
Those accustomed to making repairs on [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain ''potentially lethal voltages''. The practice of discharging power-supply [[capacitors]] and keeping one hand in your pocket when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis to one side of the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station [[ground connection]] to all equipment is encouraged.&lt;ref name="Boatanchors FAQ"/&gt; Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Cooke, VE3BDB |url=http://www.qsl.net/ve3bdb/hazards.html |title=Danger!

'''Yakov Isidorovich Perelman''' ({{lang-ru|Яков Исидорович Перельман}}; December 4, 1882 – March 16, 1942) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science writer and author of many [[popular science]] books, including ''Physics Can Be Fun'' and ''Mathematics Can Be Fun'' (both translated from [[Russian language|Russian]] into English).

Perelman was born in 1882 in the town of [[Białystok]], [[Congress Poland]]. He obtained the Diploma in Forestry from the [[Imperial Forestry Institute (Russia)|Imperial Forestry Institute]] (Now Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University) in [[Saint Petersburg]], in 1909. He was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]] and probably the Russian Machist [[Alexander Bogdanov]] in his pedagogical approach to popularising science.&lt;ref&gt;Siemsen, H. (2010) 'Mach’s Science Education, the PISA Study and Czech Science Education' in: Ernst Mach – Fyzika – Filosofie – Vzdělávání. Vol. 1 Brno: Masarykova Univerzita, 2010, pp. 255–265, DOI: 10.5817/CZ.MUNI.M210-4808-2011-255.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of "Physics for Entertainment", Perelman set out to produce other books, in which he showed himself to be an imaginative populariser of science. Especially popular were ''"Arithmetic for entertainment", "Mechanics for entertainment", "Geometry for Entertainment", "Astronomy for entertainment", "Lively Mathematics", " Physics Everywhere", and "Tricks and Amusements".

His famous books on [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] were translated into various languages by the erstwhile [[Soviet Union]].

The scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] thought highly of Perelman's talents and creative genius, writing of him in the preface of ''Interplanetary Journeys'': "The author has long been known by his popular, witty and quite scientific works on physics, astronomy and mathematics, which are, moreover written in a marvelous language and are very readable."

Perelman has also authored a number of textbooks and articles in Soviet popular science magazines.

In addition to his educational and scientific writings, he also worked as an editor of science magazines, including ''Nature and People'' and ''In the Workshop of Nature''.

Perelman died from starvation in 1942, during the German [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The siege started at 9 September 1941 and lasted 872 days, until 
27 January 1944. The Siege of Leningrad was one of the longest, most destructive sieges of a major city in modern history and one of the costliest in terms of casualties (1,117,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-t.ru/ri/ms/dz10.htm Доктор занимательных наук.

His older brother Yosif was a writer who published under the pseudonym [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]]. He is not related to the Russian mathematician [[Grigori Perelman]], who was born in 1966 to a different Yakov Perelman. However, Grigori Perelman told The New Yorker that his father gave him ''Physics for Entertainment'', and it inspired his interest in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news | last = Nasar  | first = Sylvia  |author2=Gruber, David   | title = Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it.  | work = [[The New Yorker]]  | date = 21 August 2006  | url = http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2  | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Physics for Entertainment''==
In 1913, Russian bookshops began carrying ''Physics for Entertainment''.  The educationalist's new book attracted young readers seeking answers to scientific questions.

''Physics for Entertainment'' had a unique layout as well as an instructive style.  In the preface (11th ed.) Perelman wrote: "The main objective of ''Physics for entertainment'' is to arouse the activity of scientific imagination, to teach the reader to think in the spirit of the science of physics and to create in his mind a wide variety of associations of physical knowledge with the widely differing facts of life, with all that he normally comes into contact with."

In the foreword, Perelman describes the contents as “conundrums, brain-teasers, entertaining anecdotes, and unexpected comparisons,” adding, “I have quoted extensively from [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mark Twain]] and other writers, because, besides providing entertainment, the fantastic experiments these writers describe may well serve as instructive illustrations at physics classes.”  The 13th edition (1936) would be the last published during the author's lifetime.  Among the book's notable topics was the idea of a perpetual machine: a hypothetical machine which could run incessantly performing useful work.  The author discusses perpetual motion, highlighting many attempts to build such a machine, and explains why they failed.  Other topics included how to jump from a moving car, and why, “according to the law of buoyancy, we would never drown in the [[Dead Sea]].”

[[Randall Munroe]], the creator of the web comic [[xkcd]] and author of his own popular science books, wrote: 
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book is a series of a few hundred examples, no more than one or two pages each, asking a question that illustrates some idea in basic physics.

It’s neat to see what has and hasn’t changed in the last century or so.  Many of the examples he uses seem to be straight out of a modern high school physics textbook, while others were totally new to me.  And some of the answers to the questions he poses seem obvious, but others made me stop and think. [This] diagram ... shows a design for a fountain with no pump — it took me a while to get why it works.... Later in the book, he explains the physics of that drinking bird toy.
	
It’s written in a fun, engaging, conversational style, as if he’s in the room chatting with you about these neat ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[blog.xkcd.com/2009/10/02/physics-for-entertainment/ Physics for Entertainment] Posted on 2009-10-02 by randallpmunro, xkcd: The blag of the webcomic&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ájtte''', the Swedish Mountain and Sami Museum ({{lang-sv|Svenskt fjäll- och samemuseum}}), is a cultural and natural history museum in [[Jokkmokk]] in [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Sweden]]. 

Ájtte is a museum, which specializes in the culture and nature of the mountainous area of Northern Sweden, and which is also the main museum and archive for the [[Sami culture]] of Sweden. Ájtte is also an information centre for tourism in Lapland. The word ''ájtte'' is a [[Lule Sami language]] one, meaning storage hut and referring to the museum as an archive for artifacts of the Sami cultural heritage.

Ájtte was inaugurated in June 1989 and has a staff of about 25 employees. The museum is owned and managed by a foundation, which was established in 1983 by the Swedish Government, the Norrbotten Region, the [[Jokkmokk Municipality]] and the two national Sami organizations Svenska Samernas Riksförbund (National Union of Swedish Sami people) and  Same Ätnam (Sami land). According to an agreement on financing of the museum, which was entered into the same year, the Government bodies commit themselves to a long term financial contribution to the museum. Such funds are the result of a court decision regarding compensation after rivers in Lapland have been exploited for electric power generation. The Swedish government appoints the chairman and three of the members of the board of the foundation. Thus, government funds cover around half of the current budget of the museum.&lt;ref&gt; Enquiry into the coordination of museums in Sweden, SOU 2009:15, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jokkmokk Alpine Garden==
Since 1995 Ájtte has established an alpine botanical garden at the valley of Kvarnbäcken in Jokkmokk with plants from different environments of the mountain range of Northern Scandinavia. One of the century old researcher cottages from [[Sarek National Park]], designed and used by the pioneering scientist [[Axel Hamberg]], has been dismantled and moved from Sarek and reerected in the botanical garden.
