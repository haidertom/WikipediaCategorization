== Origin of Crabtree effect in yeast ==
Approximately 100 million years ago (mya), within the yeast lineage there was a [[whole genome duplication]] (WGD).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Kenneth H.|title=Origin of the Yeast Whole-Genome Duplication|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=13|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|pmc=4529243|pmid=26252643|pages=e1002221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of Crabtree-positive yeasts are post-WGD yeasts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.

=== Driving forces ===
It is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this lifestyle, including increased tolerance to ethanol and the repression of the respiratory pathway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In high sugar environments, ''S. cerevisiae'' outcompetes and dominants all other yeast species, except its closest relative ''[[Saccharomyces paradoxus]]''.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The ability of ''S. cerevisiae'' to dominate in high sugar environments evolved more recently than aerobic fermentation and is dependent on the type of high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Other yeasts' growth is dependent on the pH and nutrients of the high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kathryn M.|last2=Liu|first2=Ping|last3=Fay|first3=Justin C.|date=2015-08-01|title=Evolution of ecological dominance of yeast species in high-sugar environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12707/abstract|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2079–2093|doi=10.1111/evo.12707|issn=1558-5646|pmc=4751874|pmid=26087012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic basis of the crabtree effect ==
The genomic basis of the crabtree effect is still being investigated, and its evolution likely involved multiple successive molecular steps that increased the efficiency of the lifestyle.

=== Expansion of hexose transporter genes ===
[[Glucose transporter|Hexose transporters]] (HXT) are a group of proteins that are largely responsible for the uptake of glucose in yeast.  In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C. P.|date=1997-08-01|title=The molecular genetics of hexose transport in yeasts|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–111|issn=0168-6445|pmid=9299703|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1997.tb00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of glucose sensor genes have remained mostly consistent through the budding yeast lineage, however glucose sensors are absent from ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''.  ''Sch. pombe'' is a Crabtree-positive yeast, which developed aerobic fermentation independently from ''Saccharomyces'' lineage, and detects glucose via the cAMP-signaling pathway.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The number of transporter genes vary significantly between yeast species and has continually increased during the evolution of the ''S. cerevisiae'' lineage.  Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.  ''Sch. pombe'' also has a high number of transporter genes compared to its close relatives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Glucose uptake is believed to be a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis and replacing ''S. cerevisiae''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''HXT1-17'' genes with a single chimera ''HXT'' gene results in decreased ethanol production or fully respiratory metabolism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Thus, having an efficient glucose uptake system appears to be essential to ability of aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  There is a significant positive correlation between the number of hexose transporter genes and the efficiency of ethanol production.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== CNV in glycolysis genes ===
[[File:Ethanol Fermentation english.png|thumb|A scheme of transformation of glucose to alcohol by alcoholic fermentation.]]
After a WGD, one of the duplicated gene pair is often lost through fractionation; less than 10% of WGD gene pairs have remained in ''S. cerevisiae'' genome.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  A little over half of WGD gene pairs in the [[glycolysis]] reaction pathway were retained in post-WGD species, significantly higher than the overall retention rate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  This has been associated with an increased ability to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, or higher rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  After glycolysis, pyruvate can either be further broken down by [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (Pdc) or [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (Pdh).  The kinetics of the enzymes are such that when pyruvate concentrations are high, due to a high rate of glycolysis, there is increased flux through Pdc and thus the fermentation pathway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The WGD is believed to have played a beneficial role in the evolution of the Crabtree effect in post-WGD species partially due to this increase in copy number of glycolysis genes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== CNV in fermentation genes ===
The fermentation reaction only involves two steps.  Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by Pdc and then acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (Adh).  There is no significant increase in the number of ''Pdc'' genes in Crabtree-positive compared to Crabtree-negative species and no correlation between number of ''Pdc'' genes and efficiency of fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55013-3_5|title=Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics of Yeast Carbon Metabolism|last=Lin|first=Zhenguo|last2=Li|first2=Wen-Hsiung|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642550126|editor-last=Piškur|editor-first=Jure|pages=97–120|language=en|editor-last2=Compagno|editor-first2=Concetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are five ''Adh'' genes in ''S. cerevisiae''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Adh1 is the major enzyme responsible for catalyzing the fermentation step from acetaldehyde to ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; for ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, Adh2 and consumption of ethanol is not essential for aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  ''Sch. pombe'' and other Crabtree positive species do not have the ''ADH2''  gene and consumes ethanol very poorly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Differential expression ===
In Crabtree-negative species, respiration related genes are highly expressed in the presence of oxygen.  However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.  However, ''S. cerevisiae'' is evolutionarily closer to ''C. albicans''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Domestication and aerobic fermentation ==
[[File:Wine Grapes with dusting that contains yeast.jpg|thumb|A close up picture of ripening wine grapes. The light white "dusting" is a film that also contains wild yeasts.]]
Aerobic fermentation is also essential for multiple industries, resulting in human domestication of several yeast strains.  Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, have played a significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legras|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Merdinoglu|first2=Didier|last3=Cornuet|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Karst|first4=Francis|date=2007-05-01|title=Bread, beer and wine: Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity reflects human history|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2091–2102|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03266.x|issn=0962-1083|pmid=17498234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species.  Introgression and HGT is common in ''Saccharomyces'' domesticated strains.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-''Saccharomyces'' species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For example, the important industrial yeast strain ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', is an interspecies hybrid of ''S. cerevisiae'' and the cold tolerant ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus|S. eubayanus]].''&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;  This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

== Aerobic fermentation in non-yeast species ==

=== Plants ===
Alcoholic fermentation is often used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and regenerate [[NAD+|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to allow for glycolysis to continue.  For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, but there are a few exceptions.  In the pollen of [[maize]] (''Zea mays'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=Million|last2=Dupuis|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kuhlemeier|first3=Cris|date=1999-08-01|title=Ethanolic fermentation: new functions for an old pathway|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599014508|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=4|issue=8|pages=320–325|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01450-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco]] (''Nicotiana tabacum'' &amp; ''Nicotiana plumbaginifolia''), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level.  In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration.  Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability.  In these tissues, respiration and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=M.|last2=Kuhlemeier|first2=C.|date=1997-10-01|title=Aerobic fermentation during tobacco pollen development|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–354|issn=0167-4412|pmid=9349258|doi=10.1023/A:1005837112653}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development.  It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].  Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.  It is believed that this trait might be due to the expression of the fermentation genes, ADH and PDC, a lot earlier on in pollen development than normal and the accumulation of toxic aldehyde.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trypanosomatids ===
When grown in glucose-rich media, [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosomatid]] parasites degrade glucose via aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In this group, this phenomenon is not a pre-adaptation to/or remnant of anaerobic life, shown through their inability to survive in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is believed that this phenomenon developed due to the capacity for a high glycolytic flux and the high glucose concentrations of their natural environment.  The mechanism for repression of respiration in these conditions is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringaud|first=Frédéric|last2=Rivière|first2=Loïc|last3=Coustou|first3=Virginie|date=2006-09-01|title=Energy metabolism of trypanosomatids: Adaptation to available carbon sources|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166685106001150|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''E. coli'' mutant ===
A couple ''Escherichia coli'' mutant strains have been bioengineered to ferment glucose under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One group developed the ECOM3 (''E. coli'' cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain by removing three terminal cytochrome oxidases (cydAB, cyoABCD, and cbdAB) to reduce oxygen uptake.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After 60 days of adaptive evolution on glucose media, the strain displayed a mixed phenotype.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In aerobic conditions, some populations' fermentation solely produced lactate, while others did mixed-acid fermentation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;[[File:Warburgh Effect.gif|thumb|Myc and HIF-1 regulate glucose metabolism and stimulate the Warburg effect.]]

=== Tumor cells ===
One of the hallmarks of cancer is altered metabolism or deregulating cellular energetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|date=4 March 2011|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411001279|journal=Cell|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|access-date=|volume=144|pages=646–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cancers cells often have reprogrammed their glucose metabolism to perform lactic acid fermentation, in the presence of oxygen, rather than send the pyruvate made through glycolysis to the mitochondria. This is referred to as the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]], and is associated with high consumption of glucose and a high rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warburg|first=Prof Otto|date=1925-03-01|title=über den Stoffwechsel der Carcinomzelle|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01726151|journal=Klinische Wochenschrift|language=de|volume=4|issue=12|pages=534–536|doi=10.1007/BF01726151|issn=0023-2173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ATP production in these cancer cells is often only through the process of glycolysis and pyruvate is broken down by the fermentation process in the cell's cytoplasm.  This phenomenon is often seen as counterintuitive, since cancer cells have higher energy demands due to the continued proliferation and respiration produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis alone (fermentation produces no additional ATP).  Typically, there is an up-regulation in glucose transporters and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (also seen in yeast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz-Ruiz|first=Rodrigo|last2=Rigoulet|first2=Michel|last3=Devin|first3=Anne|title=The Warburg and Crabtree effects: On the origin of cancer cell energy metabolism and of yeast glucose repression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005272810006869|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|volume=1807|issue=6|pages=568–576|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many parallel aspects of aerobic fermentation in tumor cells that are also seen in Crabtree-positive yeasts. Further research into the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast such as ''S. cerevisiae'' can be a useful model for understanding aerobic fermentation in tumor cells.  This has a potential for better understanding cancer and cancer treatments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2015}}
'''Alexander Rosenberg''' (born 1946) is an American philosopher, and the R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at [[Duke University]]. He is also a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Krakow-Novel-Alex-Rosenberg/dp/1477830812/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436875168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+girl+from+krakow&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rosenberg attended the [[City College of New York]] where he graduated with a B.A. in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1971. He won the [[Lakatos Award]] in 1993 and was the National [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Romanell Lecturer in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |title=Archived item |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002191946/http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg is an [[atheist]], and a [[metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Rosenberg's early work focused on the [[philosophy of social science]] and especially the [[philosophy of economics]]. His doctoral dissertation, published as ''Microeconomic Laws'' in 1976, was the first treatment of the nature of economics by a contemporary philosopher of science. Over the period of the next decade he became increasingly skeptical about [[neoclassical economics]] as an empirical theory.

He later shifted to work on issues in the [[philosophy of science]] that are raised by biology. He became especially interested in the relationship between molecular biology and other parts of biology. Rosenberg introduced the concept of [[supervenience]] to the treatment of intertheoretical relations in biology, soon after [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] began to exploit [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]]'s notion in the philosophy of psychology. Rosenberg is among the few biologists and fewer philosophers of science who reject the consensus view that combines [[physicalism]] with [[antireductionism]] (see his 2010 on-line debate with [[John Dupré]] at [[Philosophy TV]]).

Rosenberg also coauthored an influential book on [[David Hume]] with [[Tom Beauchamp]], ''[[Hume and the Problem of Causation]]'', arguing that Hume was not a skeptic about induction but an opponent of rationalist theories of inductive inference.

==Critical discussions of Rosenberg’s work==
Rosenberg’s treatment of fitness as a supervenient property, which is an undefined concept in the theory of natural selection, is criticized by Brandon and Beatty.&lt;ref&gt;in “The Propensity Interpretation of 'Fitness'--No Interpretation Is No Substitute,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 2, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; His original development of how the [[supervenience]] of Mendelian concepts blocks traditional derivational reduction was examined critically by [[C. Kenneth Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;in “Rosenberg's rebellion”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His later account of reduction in developmental biology was criticized by [[Günter Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;“How Molecular is Molecular Developmental Biology? A Reply to Alex Rosenberg's Reductionism Redux: Computing the Embryo”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott Sober]]'s "Multiple realization arguments against reductionism"&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Science'', vol. 66, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; reflects a shift towards Rosenberg's critique of anti-reductionist arguments of [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]]'s and [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]]'s.

Sober has also challenged Rosenberg’s view that the principle of natural selection is the only biological law.&lt;ref&gt;in “Two Outbreaks of Lawlessness in Recent Philosophy of Biology,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 64, No. 4, 1996 as did [[Kim Sterelny]] and [[Paul E. Griffiths]], ''Sex and Death''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanatory role of the principle of natural selection and the nature of evolutionary probabilities defended by Rosenberg were subject to counter arguments by Brandon&lt;ref&gt;in “The Indeterministic Character of Evolutionary Theory: No "No Hidden Variables Proof" but No Room for Determinism Either” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 63, No. 3 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Denis Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;“The Pomp of Superfluous Causes: The Interpretation of Evolutionary Theory”, ''Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 74, No. 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg's account of the nature of [[genetic drift]] and the role of probability in the theory of natural selection draws on significant parallels between the principle of natural selection and the second law of thermodynamics.

In the philosophy of social science, Rosenberg’s more skeptical views about [[microeconomics]] were challenged first by Wade Hands&lt;ref&gt;in “What Economics Is Not: An Economist's Response to Rosenberg”, ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 3 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Daniel Hausman in several books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;including “Economic Methodology in a Nutshell," ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 3, No. 2 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial crisis of 2008–09 resulted in renewed attention to Rosenberg's skeptical views about [[microeconomics]]. Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and historian Joseph Fracchia express skepticism about Rosenberg’s claim that functional explanations in social science require Darwinian underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;“Does Culture Evolve?” ''History and Theory'' 38 (4), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Atheist's Guide to Reality''==
In 2011 Rosenberg published a defense of what he called "[[Scientism]]"—the claim that "the persistent questions" people ask about the nature of reality, the purpose of things, the foundations of value and morality, the way the mind works, the basis of personal identity, and the course of human history, could all be answered by the resources of science. This book was attacked on the front cover of [[The New Republic]] by [[Leon Wieseltier]] as "The worst book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/washington-diarist/magazine/98566/science-atheism-meaning-life#.|title=Leon Wieseltier: The Answers – The New Republic|author=Leon Wieseltier|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wieseltier|Leon Wiseltier]]'s claim, in turn, was critiqued as exaggeration by [[Philip Kitcher]] in [[The New York Times Book Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/alex-rosenbergs-the-atheists-guide-to-reality.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Kitcher | title=Alex Rosenberg's 'The Atheist's Guide to Reality' | date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2013, Rosenberg debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the topics discussed in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symposiachristi.com/debate/ |title=Is Faith in God Reasonable? |website=Symposia Christi |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg has contributed articles to ''[[The New York Times]]'' Op/Ed series [[The Stone (blog)|The Stone]], on naturalism, science and the humanities, and meta-ethics, and the mind's powers to understand itself by introspection that arise from the views he advanced in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/|title=Can Moral Disputes be Resolved|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/why-you-dont-know-your-own-mind|author=Alexander Rosenberg|publisher=”[[The New York Times]]”|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Girl From Krakow''==
Rosenberg’s 2015 novel, ''The Girl From Krakow'', Lake Union Publishing, is a narrative about a young woman named Rita Feuerstahl from 1935 to 1947, mainly focusing on her struggles to survive in Nazi-occupied Poland and later in Germany, under a false identity. A secondary plot involves her lover’s experiences in France and Spain during its Civil War in the 1930s and then in Moscow during the war. Rosenberg has acknowledged that the novel is based on the wartime experiences of people he knew. He has also admitted the incongruity of writing a narrative, given his attack on the form in ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality''. He has said that ''The Girl from Krakow'' began as an attempt to put some of the difficult arguments of ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality'' into a form easier to grasp".&lt;ref&gt;Ognian Georgiev (August 8, 2015). [http://landofbooks.org/2015/08/08/alex-rosenberg-the-girl-from-krakow-is-based-on-people-who-survived-the-war "Alex Rosenberg: ''The Girl from Krakow'' is based on people who survived the war"], ''Land of Books''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Girl From Krakow'' has been translated into Italian, Hungarian, Polish and Hebrew.

==''Autumn in Oxford''==
In 2016 Rosenberg’s second novel, ''Autumn in Oxford'', appeared, also published by Lake Union Publishing. An afterword identifies the large number of real persons—academics, civil rights advocates, military officers, politicians and intelligence agents from the 1940s and '50s who figure in the narrative.

==''How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories''==
In 2018 Rosenberg published ’‘How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories’‘ This work develops the eliminative materialism of ‘‘The Atheist’s guide to Reality‘‘ applying it to the role ‘the theory of mind’ plays in history and other forms of story telling.  Rosenberg argues that the work of [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Eric Kandel]], [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[May-Britt Moser]] along with [[Edvard Moser]] reveals that the ‘‘theory of mind‘‘ employed in every day life and narrative history has no basis in the organization of the brain. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology, child psychology, medical diagnosis and neural imaging reveals it is an innate or almost innate tool that arose in [[Hominini]] evolution to foster collaboration among small numbers of individuals in immediate contact over the near future, but whose predictive weakness beyond this domain reveals its explanatory emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Samira Shackle (October 19, 2018).[https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5371/can-we-learn-from-history"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anywhere on Earth''' (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on [[Howland and Baker islands]], in the [[UTC−12:00|IDLW]] time zone (the West side of the [[International Date Line]]), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/16/aoe.html|title=IEEE 802.16 AOE Deadline Documentation|website=www.ieee802.org|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention originated in [[IEEE 802.16]] balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. This means that the deadline has not passed if, anywhere on Earth, the deadline date has not yet passed.

Note that the day's end AoE occurs at noon [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) of the following day,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Howland and Baker islands]] being halfway around the world from the [[prime meridian]] that is the base reference longitude for UTC.

Thus, in standard notation this is:

The '''Biefeld–Brown effect''' is an electrical phenomenon that produces an [[ionic wind]] that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles. It describes a force observed on an asymmetric [[capacitor]] when high voltage is applied to the capacitor's electrodes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bahder|first=Thomas|last2=Fazi|first2=Christian|date=June 2003|title=Force on an Asymmetric Capacitor|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA416740|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once suitably charged up to high [[Direct current|DC]] potentials, a thrust from the negative terminal to the positive terminal is generated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tajmar|first=Martin|date=February 2004|title=Biefeld-Brown Effect: Misinterpretation of Corona Wind Phenomena|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245425484|journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|volume=42|issue=2|pages=315–318|via=ResearchGate|bibcode=2004AIAAJ..42..315T|doi=10.2514/1.9095}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was named by inventor [[Thomas Townsend Brown]] who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy [[Paul Alfred Biefeld]], a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at [[Denison University]] in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;The present day Denison University claims they have no record of such experiments being carried out, or of any association between Brown and Biefeld.[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.

The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more [[thrust]] to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canning|first=Francis|last2=Melcher|first2=Cory|last3=Winet|first3=Edwin|date=1 October 2004|title=Asymmetrical Capacitors for Propulsion|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040171929|journal=NASA Technical Reports Server|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biefeld–Brown effect can be observed in [[ionocraft]]s and [[Lifter (ionic propulsion device)|lifters]], which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|Thomas Townsend Brown}}

The "Biefeld–Brown effect" was the name given to a phenomenon observed by Thomas Townsend Brown while he was experimenting with [[X-ray tube]]s during the 1920s while he was still in high school. When he applied a high voltage electrical charge to a [[Coolidge tube]] that he placed on a scale, Brown noticed a difference in the tubes mass depending on orientation, implying some kind of [[net force]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/apr/17/science.highereducation|title=TT Brown's Electrogravitics|last=Pilkington|first=Mark|date=16 April 2003|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery caused him to assume that he had somehow influenced gravity electronically and led him to design a propulsion system based on this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chipdesignmag.com/carter/2012/12/10/thomas-townsend-brown-part-iv-of-the-holiday-serial/|title=Thomas Townsend Brown: Part IV of the Holiday Serial|last=|first=|date=|website=Systems Design Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 1927, he applied for a patent, entitled "Method of Producing Force or Motion," that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1929, Brown published an article for the popular American magazine ''Science and Invention'', which detailed his work. The article also mentioned the "gravitator," an invention by Brown which produced motion without the use of electromagnetism, gears, propellers, or wheels, but instead using the principles of what he called "electro-gravitation." He also claimed that the asymmetric capacitors were capable of generating mysterious fields that interacted with the Earth's [[Gravity|gravitational pull]] and envisioned a future where gravitators would propel ocean liners and even space cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/HowIControl.html|title=How I Control Gravitation|last=Brown|first=Thomas|date=August 1929|work=Science and Invention|access-date=27 August 2018|archive-url=http://blog.lege.net/content/Gravitator_1926.pdf|archive-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point this effect also gained the moniker "Biefeld–Brown effect", probably coined by Brown to claim [[Denison University]] professor of physics and astronomy [[Paul Alfred Biefeld]] as his mentor and co-experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/12_biefeld-brown.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T.

Brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the Biefeld–Brown effect, making the following claims:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# There is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect, where the shorter the distance, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect, where the higher the strength, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the area of the conductors and the strength of the effect, where the greater the area, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the voltage difference between the capacitor plates and the strength of the effect, where the greater the voltage, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the mass of the dielectric material and the strength of the effect, where the greater the mass, the greater the effect.

In 1965, Brown filed a patent that claimed that a net force on the asymmetric capacitor can exist even in a [[vacuum]]. However, there is little experimental evidence that serves to validate his claims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effect analysis==
[[File:Asymm-capacitor.svg|right]]

The effect is generally believed to rely on [[corona discharge]], which allows air molecules to become [[ion]]ized near sharp points and edges. Usually, two [[electrodes]] are used with a high voltage between them, ranging from a few kilovolts and up to megavolt levels, where one electrode is small or sharp, and the other larger and smoother. The most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kV/cm, which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points, at a current density level usually referred to as the saturated corona current condition. This creates a high field gradient around the smaller, positively charged electrode. Around this electrode, ionization occurs, that is, [[electron]]s are stripped from the atoms in the surrounding medium; they are literally pulled right off by the electrode's charge.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

This leaves a cloud of positively charged [[ion]]s in the medium, which are attracted to the negative smooth electrode by [[Coulomb's Law]], where they are neutralized again. This produces an equally scaled opposing force in the lower electrode. This effect can be used for propulsion (see [[EHD thruster]]), [[fluid]] [[pump]]s and recently also in EHD cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kocik|first=Marek|title=A System for Liquid Cooling of Electronic Elements with EHD Pumping Mechanism|url=http://www.iesj.org/html/service/ijpest/vol10_no1_2016/PDF/IJPEST_Vol10_No1_10_pp047-050.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The velocity achievable by such setups is limited by the momentum achievable by the ionized air, which is reduced by ion impact with neutral air. A theoretical derivation of this force has been proposed (see the external links below).

However, this effect works using either polarity for the electrodes: the small or thin electrode can be either positive or negative, and the larger electrode must have the opposite polarity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On many experimental sites it is reported that the thrust effect of a lifter is actually a bit stronger when the small electrode is the positive one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is possibly an effect of the differences between the ionization energy and electron affinity energy of the constituent parts of air; thus the ease of which ions are created at the 'sharp' electrode.

As air pressure is removed from the system, several effects combine to reduce the force and momentum available to the system. The number of air molecules around the ionizing electrode is reduced, decreasing the quantity of ionized particles. At the same time, the number of impacts between ionized and neutral particles is reduced. Whether this increases or decreases the maximum momentum of the ionized air is not typically measured, although the force acting upon the electrodes reduces, until the glow discharge region is entered. The reduction in force is also a product of the reducing breakdown voltage of air, as a lower potential must be applied between the electrodes, thereby reducing the force dictated by Coulomb's Law.

During the glow discharge region, the air becomes a conductor.  Though the applied voltage and current will propagate at nearly the speed of light, the movement of the conductors themselves is almost negligible. This leads to a Coulomb force and change of momentum so small as to be zero.

Below the glow discharge region, the breakdown voltage increases again, whilst the number of potential ions decreases, and the chance of impact lowers. Experiments have been conducted and found to both prove and disprove a force at very low pressure. It is likely that the reason for this is that at very low pressures, only experiments which used very large voltages produced positive results, as a product of a greater chance of ionization of the extremely limited number of available air molecules, and a greater force from each ion from Coulomb's Law; experiments which used lower voltages have a lower chance of ionization and a lower force per ion. Common to positive results is that the force observed is small in comparison to experiments conducted at standard pressure.

==Disputes surrounding electrogravity and ion wind==
Brown believed that his large, high voltage, high capacity capacitors produced an electric field strong enough to marginally interacted with the Earth's gravitational pull, a phenomenon he labeled [[electrogravitics]]. Several researchers claim that conventional physics cannot adequately explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has become something of a [[cause célèbre]] in the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] community, where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than [[electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]]. [[Charles Berlitz]] devoted an entire chapter of his book ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment]]'' to a retelling of Brown's early work with the effect, implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by UFOs.  Today, the [[Internet]] is filled with sites devoted to this interpretation of the effect.

There have been follow-ups on the claims that this force can be produced in a full vacuum, meaning it is an unknown anti-gravity force, and not just the more well known [[ion wind]]. As part of a study in 1990, [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] researcher R. L. Talley conducted a test on a Biefeld–Brown-style capacitor to replicate the effect in a vacuum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite attempts that increased the driving DC voltage to about 19 kV in vacuum chambers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr, Talley observed no thrust in terms of static DC potential applied to the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Talley|first=R. L.|date=May 1991|title=Twenty First Century Propulsion Concept|url=http://www.otherhand.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Talley-paper-propulsion-concept.pdf|journal=Air Force Systems Command|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[NASA]] scientist Jonathan Campbell tested a lifter in a vacuum at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; torr with a voltage of up to 50 kV, only to observe no movement from the lifter. Campbell pointed out to a [[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]] reporter that creating a true vacuum similar to space for the test requires tens of thousands of dollars in equipment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Around the same time in 2003, researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] tested the Biefeld–Brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the Internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kV to them. According to their report, the researchers claimed that the effects of ion wind was at least three orders of magnitude too small to account for the observed force on the asymmetric capacitor in the air. Instead, they proposed that the Biefeld–Brown effect may be better explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around ten years later, researchers from the [[Technical University of Liberec]] conducted experiments on the Biefeld–Brown effect that supported ARL's claim that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik|first=M.|last2=Primas|first2=J.|last3=Vopecky|first3=V.|last4=Svoboda|first4=M.|date=January 2014|title=Calculation and measurement of a neutral air flow velocity impacting a high voltage capacitor with asymmetrical electrodes|journal=AIP Advances|volume=4|issue=1|pages=017137|doi=10.1063/1.4864181|bibcode=2014AIPA....4a7137M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Martin Tajmar]] published a paper that also failed to replicate Brown's work and suggested that Brown may have instead observed the effects of a [[corona wind]] triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Patents==

[[Carbon]] is a key component of all known [[life]] on [[Earth]], representing approximately 45-50% of all dry biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/forestry/17111/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[molecule]]s are made up of [[carbon]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] with other [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] and frequently also with [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]]. Carbon is abundant on Earth. It is also lightweight and relatively small in size, making it easier for enzymes to manipulate carbon molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is frequently assumed in [[astrobiology]] that if life exists elsewhere in the [[universe]], it will also be carbon-based.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics refer to this assumption as [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref name =darling&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/carbon-based_life.html |title=Carbon-based life |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=David|last=Darling |publisher=Encyclopedia of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;"There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes." {{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorus", per [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 2008 lecture, "carbon [...] has the richest chemistry." &lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Hawking|title=Life in the Universe, 50th anniversary celebration of NASA|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/05/stephen-hawking-on-non-carbon-based-alien-life.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important characteristics of carbon as a basis for the [[chemistry]] of life are, that it has four valence bonds, and that the energy required to make or break a bond is at an appropriate level for building molecules, which are stable and reactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms; this allows the building of arbitrarily long complex molecules and [[polymers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other candidates==
There are not many other elements which even appear to be promising candidates for supporting life, for example, processes such as [[metabolism]]. The most frequently suggested alternative is [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is in the same group in the [[Periodic Table]] of [[chemical element|elements]], and has four [[valence bond theory|valence bonds]], and bonds to itself, generally in the form of [[crystal lattice]]s rather than long chains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is considerably more electropositive than carbon. Silicon compounds do not readily [[Recombination_(chemistry)|recombine]] into different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support lifelike processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Key  molecules ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The most notable groups of chemicals used in the processes of living organisms include:

* [[Protein]]s, which are the building blocks from which the structures of living organisms are constructed (this includes almost all [[enzyme]]s, which [[catalyst|catalyse]] organic chemical reactions)
* [[Nucleic acid]]s, which carry [[Genetics|genetic]] information
* [[Carbohydrate]]s, which store energy in a form that can be used by living [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* [[Lipid]]s, which also store energy, but in a more concentrated form, and which may be stored for extended periods in the bodies of animals

==Fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Silicon has been a theme of non-carbon-based-life since it is somewhat similar to carbon in its chemical characteristics.  
In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], when man-made machines cross from non-living to living, this new form would be an example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as "silicon-based life". Another example of "silicon-based life" is the episode "The Devil in the Dark" from [[Star Trek: The Original Series]], in which a living rock creature's biochemistry is based on silicon. Also in The X-Files episode "Firewalker" where silicon based organism was discovered in a volcano.

In the [[2010_(film)|movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1984)]] a character argues, "Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002895/quotes|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This quote may be the basis of [[Steve Jobs]]'s quip when he introduced [[Carbon (API)|Carbon within MacOS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC '98|url=http://www.noteskey.com/events/1998_05.html|website=NotesKey|date = May 11, 1998|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Carbon.

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].

== Physics ==

Inertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation "bubbles" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.

The vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.

The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work ''Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries''&lt;ref&gt;Logvinovich, GV (1969) Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries. Naukova dumka, Kiev, 215p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, RT, Daili, JW, Hammit, FG (1970) Cavitation. New York: Mc Graw Hill Book Company.  578p.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;Epshtein, LA (1970) Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels. Sudostroyenie , Leningrad, 208p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural continuation of these studies was recently presented in ''The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows''&lt;ref&gt;Terentiev, A, Kirschner, I, Uhlman, J, (2011) The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows. Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  – an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A. M. |year=2009 |title=A review of applications of cavitation in biochemical engineering/biotechnology |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=60–72 |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2008.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Chemical engineering===
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].

Use of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. --&gt;

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together. This effect may assist in [[protein folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/snap.html | website = Sandia National Laboratories | date = 2006-08-02 | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | title = Sandia researchers solve mystery of attractive surfaces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasound sometimes is used to increase bone formation, for instance in post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhysioMontreal Article "Ultrasound".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound treatments or exposure can create cavitation that potentially may "result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada "Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II – Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110213842/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the sound of [[cracking joints|"cracking" knuckles]] derives from the collapse of cavitation in the synovial fluid within the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=A|author2=Dowson, D|author3=Wright, V|title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=July 1971|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–58|pmid=5557778|doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348|pmc=1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements that cause cracking expand the joint space, thus reducing pressure to the point of cavitation. It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis. Some physicians say that osteoarthritis is caused by cracking knuckles regularly, as this causes wear and tear and may cause the bone to weaken. The implication being that, it is not the "bubbles popping," but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

=== Food and beverage ===

==== Eggs ====
Cavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A. C. |first=Masters I. |doi=10.1177/0957650913477093 |year=2013 |title=Cavitation inception and simulation in blade element momentum theory for modelling tidal stream turbines |journal=Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=479–485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumps and propellers===
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

====Suction cavitation====
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

Common causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

====Discharge cavitation====
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

====Cavitation solutions====
Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.

To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pulp &amp; Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes&lt;/ref&gt;
To overcome cavitation:
Increase suction pressure if possible.
Decrease liquid temperature if possible.
Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.
Vent gases off the pump casing.

===Control valves===

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.

===Spillways===
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc. Intl. Symp. on Scale Effects in Modelling Hydraulic Structures, IAHR, Esslingen, Germany, H. KOBUS editor, paper 4.5 |year=1984 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name="Peterka_1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting." Joint Meeting Paper, IAHR/ASCE, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Aug. 1953, pp. 507–518 |year=1953 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the flow velocities near the spillway invert are sufficiently high, aerators (or aeration devices) must be introduced to prevent cavitation. Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989a"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301–319 (ISSN 0022-1686)  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989b"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high flow velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

===Engines===
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

===Geology===
Some hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.

The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat. Rising magma, filled with dissolved gasses and under immense pressure, encountered a different magma that compressed easily, allowing bubbles to grow and combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html|title=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.

===Vascular plants===
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., &amp; Tyree, M.T., 1996. New evidence for large negative xylem pressures and their measurement by the pressure chamber technique. 'Plant Cell Environ.' 19: 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. This primarily occurs near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is low.

Cavitation may limit the maximum swimming speed of powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are painful. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings and do not feel pain from cavitation. They are slowed down when cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name="IosilevskiiWeihs2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=20|year=2008|pages=329–338|issn=1742-5689|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea animals have found ways to use cavitation to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thresher sharks]] use 'tail slaps' to debilitate their small fish prey and cavitation bubbles have been seen rising from the apex of the tail arc.&lt;ref name="TsiklirasOliver2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsikliras|first1=Athanassios C.|last2=Oliver|first2=Simon P.|last3=Turner|first3=John R.|last4=Gann|first4=Klemens|last5=Silvosa|first5=Medel|last6=D'Urban Jackson|first6=Tim|title=Thresher Sharks Use Tail-Slaps as a Hunting Strategy|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=7|year=2013|pages=e67380|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067380|pmid=23874415|pmc=3707734|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...867380O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHoCCPsRuhg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal erosion===
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=978-0-444-89830-2 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded. Varying pressure decompresses some vapor pockets which subsequently implode. The resulting pressure peaks can blast apart fractions of the rock.

[[File:CoandaEffekt2.jpg|thumb|A spinning ping pong ball is held in a diagonal stream of air by the Coandă effect. The ball "sticks" to the lower side of the air stream, which stops the ball from falling down. The jet as a whole keeps the ball some distance from the jet exhaust, and gravity prevents it from being blown away.]]

The '''Coandă effect''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|n|d|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|æ|-}}) is the tendency of a [[fluid]] [[Jet (fluid)|jet]] to stay attached to a convex surface. As described by the eponymous [[Henri Coandă]] in different patents:  "the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops." The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coandă effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tritton, D.J., Physical Fluid Dynamics, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1977 (reprinted 1980), Section 22.7, The Coandă Effect.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Coanda%20effect&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was named after [[Romanian people|Romanian]] aerodynamics pioneer Henri Coandă, who was the first to recognize the practical application of the phenomenon in aircraft development.&lt;ref&gt;"The Coanda effect is a phenomenon that was first observed in 1910 by a mathematician and engineer named Henri Coandă. He discovered that when air was ejected from a rectangular nozzle, it would attach itself to an inclined flat plate connected to the nozzle exit. Emphasizing the need for a sharp angle between the nozzle and the flat plate, Coandă then applied the principle to a series of deflecting surfaces, each at a sharp angle to the previous one, and succeeded in turning flows through angles as large as 180. He stated that "when a jet of fluid is passed over a curved surface, it bends to follow the surface, entraining large amounts of air as it does so," and this phenomenon has become known as the ''Coandă Effect''. ''On Some Recent Applications of the Coanda Effect'' Caroline Lubert International Journal of Acoustics and Vibration, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2011 http://www.iiav.org/ijav/content/volumes/16_2011_1739941303237209/vol_3/237_firstpage_856831320254369.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coandă effect.

==Discovery==
An early description of this phenomenon was provided by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in a lecture given to [[The Royal Society]] in 1800:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle. Mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the surface of water. Bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately
show the current is deflected towards the body; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current...&lt;ref&gt;
The pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere, a.k.a. The Atmospheric Press, which at 14.7psi at sea level makes water or other liquids lay smooth. Blow on a part of the water and the pressure is increased a slight amount which naturally makes the water move away.   Direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the Atmospheric Press pressing on the water.
The hotter the flame and the closer to the surface the greater the effect will be seen.

A hundred years later, Henri Coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his [[Coandă-1910]] aircraft, which mounted an unusual engine he designed. The motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward, and Coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces. In 1934 Coandă obtained a patent in [[France]] for a "method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid." The effect was described as the "deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall." The first official documents that explicitly mention the Coandă effect were two 1936 patents by Henri Coandă.&lt;ref&gt;Coanda, H. "US Patent# 2,052,869." Device for Deflecting a Stream of Elastic Fluid Projected into an Elastic Fluid (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coanda H. (1936a), US Patent n. 3,261,162, Lifting Device Coanda Effect, USA&lt;/ref&gt; This name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist [[Theodore von Kármán]], who had with Coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eisner|first=Thomas|title=For Love of Insects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki9djoKOm-0C&amp;pg=PA177|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01827-3|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coanda effect 6.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A diagram of a generic engine that harnesses the Coandă Effect to generate lift (or forward motion if tilted 90° on its side). The engine is approximately bullet or inverted bowl shaped, with fluid being expelled horizontally from a circular slit near the top of the bullet. A small step at the lower edge of the slit ensures that a low pressure vortex develops immediately below the point where the fluid exits the slit (see image 5 in the illustration on the left). From there on the Coandă effect causes the sheet of fluid to cling to the curved outer surface of the engine. The entrainment of the ambient fluid into the stream flowing over the bullet, causes a low pressure area above the bullet (see images 1-5 on the left) . This, together with the ambient ("high") pressure below the bullet causes lift, or, if mounted horizontally, forward motion in the direction of the apex of the bullet.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;]]

A jet of air will entrain molecules of air from its immediate surroundings, causing a "tube," or "sleeve," of low pressure around the jet (see image 1 in the diagram on the left). Ambient air from around this tube of low pressure will exert a force on the jet, which, when seen in cross section, is equal in all directions. The jet will therefore not deviate from moving in a straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel, to the jet (see image 2 in the diagram on the left), the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that cannot be neutralized as rapidly as the low pressure region on the "open" side of the jet. The pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it (image 3 on the left).&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thermofluids&gt;[http://www.thermofluids.co.uk/effect.php Coanda Effect] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The jet will then adhere to the surface even if it is curved (image 4 on the left), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface will bring about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://karmak.org/archive/2003/02/coanda_effect.html Jeff Raskin: Coanda Effect: Understanding how wings work.] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If the surface is not too sharply curved, the jet can, under the right circumstances, adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface, and therefore be traveling in a direction opposite to its initial direction. The forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt; These Coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion, depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres.&lt;ref name=Reba&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reba |first1=Imants |date=June 1966 |title=Applications of the Coanda effect|journal= Scientific American|volume=214 |issue=6 |pages=84–921 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0666-84|bibcode=1966SciAm.214f..84R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small "lip" on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface (see image 5 in the diagram on the left), enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet, and its subsequent adherence to the surface. This results from the fact that a low pressure vortex forms behind the lip, promoting the dip of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

The Coandă effect can be induced in any fluid, and is therefore equally effective in water as in air.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

==Conditions of existence==

Early sources provide information, both  theoretical and experimental, needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the Coandă effect and its limits. Coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a ''free jet'' or a ''wall jet''.

On the left image of the preceding section: "The mechanism of Coanda effect", the effect as described, in the terms of T. Young as "the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle", represents a ''free jet'' emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings. It includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access, without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle  in the surroundings, as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure.

On the right image, the effect occurs along the curved wall as a ''wall jet''. The image here on the right represents a ''two dimensional wall jet'' between two parallel plane walls, where the "obstacle" is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice, so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air.

1. [[Wall jet]]. To compare experiment with a theoretical model, we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width ''h'' along a circular wall of radius ''r''. A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather  whose radius is the radius of the Earth ''without separation'' because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.
[[File:Surface pressure of a wall jet along a circular wall.png|thumb|Measurements of surface pressure along a circularly curved wall of radius r = 12 cm, deflecting a [[turbulent]] jet of air ([[Reynolds number]] = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) of width h. The pressure begins to fall before the origin of the jet, due to local effects at the point of exit of the air from the nozzle which creates the jet. If the h/r ratio (ratio of the width of the jet to the radius of curvature of the wall) is less than 0.5, a true Coandă effect is observed, with the wall pressures along the curved wall remaining at this low (sub-ambient pressure) level until the jet reaches the end of the wall (when the pressure rapidly returns to ambient pressure). If the h/r ratio is more than 0.5, only the local effects occur at the origin of the jet, after which the jet immediately separates from the wall, and there is no Coandă effect. Experiments by M. Kadosch and J. Liermann in  M. Kadosch's  laboratory, SNECMA.&lt;ref name=kadosh /&gt;]]
With a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon ''h/r'', the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and  after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear at the point  where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).

Experiments made in 1956 with [[turbulent]] air jets at a [[Reynolds number]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; at various  jet widths ({{mvar|h}}) show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall (radius {{mvar|r}}) at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet (see the diagram on the right).&lt;ref name=kadosh&gt;Kadosch M., ''Déviation d’un jet par adhérence à une paroi convexe'' in ''Journal de Physique et le Radium'', avril 1958, Paris, pp.1–12A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Gersten&gt;Kadosch M., ''"The curved wall effect"'' in 2nd Cranfield Fluidics Conference, Cambridge, 3 janvier 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Above a critical {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall. The jet then immediately separates from the curved wall. A Coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment:  a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9°, followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer, subject to this positive longitudinal gradient. However, if the {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5, the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall (until the wall ends &amp;mdash; see diagram on the right). This is "a true Coandă effect" as the jet clings to the wall "at a nearly constant pressure" as in a conventional wall jet.

A calculation made by Woods in 1954&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Woods, ''Compressible subsonic flow in two-dimensional channels with mixed boundary conditions'', in ''Quart. Journ. Mech. And Applied Math.'', VII, 3, {{pp.|263–282}}, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[inviscid]] flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall, where a singular point appears with an infinite  slope of the surface pressure curve. 
[[File:Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet.jpg|thumb|Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet]]

Introducing in the calculation  the angle at separation found in the preceding  experiments for each value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}}, the image here was recently obtained,&lt;ref&gt;Kadosch M., Illusions créatrices, CreateSpace &amp; Kindle,2015, Ch. 8,  Coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs, {{pp.|91 to 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated  pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke,&lt;ref&gt;M. Van Dyke (1969), ''Higher-Order Boundary-Layer Theory'', Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; quoted in [[Lift (force)]] Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible.

An alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates. A rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and the Reynolds number:&lt;ref name = Gersten/&gt; The results are reported on the image, e.g., 54° calculated instead of 60° measured for {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.25}}. More experiments and a more accurate boundary layer calculation would be desirable.

Other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that Coandă effect does not occur in a [[laminar flow]], and the critical h/r ratios for small Reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T. |last1=Vit |first2=F. |last2=Marsik |title=Experimental and Theoretical Study of Heated Coandă Jet |journal=XXI International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics |location=Warsaw, Poland |date=August 15–21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.14}} if {{math|1=Re=500}} and {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.05}} if {{math|1=Re=100}}.

2. [[Free jet]]. L. C. Woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of  a free jet of width h, deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r, between a first contact A and separation at B, including a deflection angle θ. Again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and angle θ. 
Moreover in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form, giving the distribution of  velocity along the circular wall. The surface pressure distribution is then calculated using Bernoulli equation. Let us note {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the pressure and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure, and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in A and θ in B. Then the velocity {{mvar|v}} is found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{v_a} = \exp\bigg[{2h \over\pi r} \tan^{-1}\bigg( \big[{\sinh^2 ({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) - \cosh^2({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) \tanh^2({\pi\gamma r \over 4h})}\big]^{1/2}\bigg)\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

An image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of  the relative curvature h/r, and the same angle θ as those  found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established: it may be found in reference (15) p. 104 and both images are quite similar : Coanda effect of  a free jet is  inertial, the same as Coanda effect of a wall jet. However, an experimental measurement of the corresponding surface pressure distribution is not known.

Experiments in 1959 by Bourque and Newmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourque |first1=C. |last2=Newmann |first2=B. G. |title=Reattachment of a two-dimensional, incompressible jet to an adjacent flat Plate |journal=The Aeronautical Quarterly |volume=XI |date=August 1960 |pages=201 ''et seq''}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined (as in the image 5 in the preceding section) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet: the jet separates from the plate, then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered, and eventually reattaches to it, enclosing a separation bubble. The jet remains free if the angle is greater than 62°.

In this last case which is the geometry  proposed by Coanda, the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet  from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected, a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines, and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing, as indicated in the applications below.

The surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases, and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble, the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice: the agreement with experiment was satisfactory.

==Applications==
The Coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on [[aircraft]], where air moving over the wing can be "bent down" towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing. The bending of the flow results in [[aerodynamic lift]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid." Lift from Flow Turning NASA Glenn Research Center http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a [[podded engines|pod]] over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity [[gradient]] in the [[shear flow]] in the boundary layer. In this velocity gradient, particles are blown away from the surface, thus lowering the pressure there. Closely following the work of Coandă on applications of his research, and in particular the work on his "Aerodina Lenticulară,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.ttu.edu/~cmyles/Phys5306/Talks/2004/Fluid%20Dynamics.ppt Fluid Dynamics by Mihaela-Maria Tanasescu, Texas Tech University]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Carver Meadows Frost|John Frost]] of [[Avro Canada]] also spent considerable time researching the effect, leading to a series of "inside out" [[hovercraft]]-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being "attached" to a flap-like ring.
[[File:Avrocar at factory.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first Avrocar being readied at the Avro factory in 1958]]
This is as opposed to a traditional hovercraft design, in which the air is blown into a central area, the ''plenum'', and directed down with the use of a fabric "skirt." Only one of Frost's designs was ever built, the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]].

The [[VZ-9 AV Avrocar]] (often listed as '''VZ-9''') was a Canadian [[vertical takeoff and landing|vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)]] aircraft developed by [[Avro Canada|Avro Aircraft Ltd.]] as part of a secret United States military project carried out in the early years of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 2003, pp. 281–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single "turborotor" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated [[VTOL]]-like performance. In the air, it would have resembled a [[flying saucer]]. Two prototypes were built as "proof-of-concept" test vehicles for a more advanced [[USAF|U.S. Air Force]] fighter and also for a [[U.S. Army]] tactical combat aircraft requirement.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Milberry 1979, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avro's 1956 [[Project 1794]] for the US military designed a larger-scale flying saucer based on the Coandă effect and intended to reach speeds between Mach 3 and Mach 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/137505-us-air-forces-1950s-supersonic-flying-saucer-declassified, US Air Force's 1950s supersonic flying saucer declassified]&lt;/ref&gt; Project documents remained classified until 2012.
 
The effect was also implemented during the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport|AMST]] project. Several aircraft, notably the [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]] (the first modern type to exploit the effect), NASA's  [[Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft]], and the [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]]'s [[Kawasaki C-1|Asuka]] research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect, by mounting [[turbofan]]s on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds, but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree, the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-72|An-72 "Coaler."]] The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] flying boat utilizes a similar system, only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift. More uniquely, it incorporates a fifth turboshaft engine inside of the wing center-section solely to provide air for powerful [[blown flap]]s. The addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive STOL capability.

Extended slats and flaps are used on commercial aircraft on landing and taking off; but are also used to great effect on fighter aircraft to allow slow airspeeds when necessary. This is not an engineering drawing, but a somewhat exaggerated diagram to emphasize the major points.]]
[[Image:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|The [[C-17 Globemaster III]] uses the Coandă effect in the same way as the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] (depicted on the right), but with additional use of the exhaust from the engines over the upper surfaces of the wings to cause lift for a comfortable ride at low flying speeds]]

The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] and its successor, the Boeing [[C-17 Globemaster III]], also employ the effect. The [[NOTAR]] helicopter replaces the conventional [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] tail rotor with a Coandă effect tail (diagram on the left).

An important practical use of the Coandă effect is for inclined [[hydropower]] screens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf Hydropower in the U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621110923/http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, Coandă effect used in debris screen design.&lt;/ref&gt; which separate debris, fish, etc., otherwise in the input flow to the turbines. Due to the slope, the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing, and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the Coandă effect, the water flows through the screen to the [[penstock]]s leading the water to the turbines.

The Coandă effect is used in dual-pattern fluid dispensers in automobile windshield washers.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4210283|"Dual pattern windshield washer nozzle"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two "islands." Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes under one of the islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but in the direction of the second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, David W. "Industrial Flow measurement." Instrument Society of America, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[air conditioning]], the Coandă effect is exploited to increase the [[throw (engineering)|throw]] of a ceiling mounted [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]]. Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to "stick" to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser was mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, in the case of [[variable air volume]] (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater [[turndown ratio]]s. [[Linear diffuser]]s and [[slot diffuser]]s that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.

In [[cardiovascular medicine]], the Coandă effect accounts for the separate streams of blood in the [[fetal]] right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashrafian H. The Coandă effect and preferential right atrial streaming.
Chest. 2006 Jul;130(1):300.&lt;/ref&gt; It also explains why eccentric [[mitral regurgitation]] jets are attracted and dispersed along adjacent left atrial wall surfaces (so called "wall-hugging jets" as seen on echocardiographic color-doppler interrogation). This is clinically relevant because the visual area (and thus severity) of these eccentric wall-hugging jets is often underestimated compared to the more readily apparent central jets. In these cases, volumetric methods such as the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method are preferred to quantify the severity of [[mitral regurgitation]].

In medicine, the Coandă effect is used in ventilators.&lt;ref&gt;http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/859.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fluidic+ventilator&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japi.org/june_2009/16_MP_Anaestheisa_and_Critical_Care.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[meteorology]], the Coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Transylvanian Alps]], where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted. It also appears to be an effect in the [[Rhone Valley]] in France and near [[Big Delta]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, B.D. Fluidics, The Coandă Effect, and some orographic winds. Arch.Met.Geoph.Biokl. Ser.A. 25, 1977, 273–279&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Formula One]] automobile racing, the Coandă effect has been exploited by the McLaren, Sauber, Ferrari and Lotus teams, after the first introduction by Adrian Newey (Red Bull Team) in 2011, to help redirect exhaust gases to run through the rear diffuser with the intention of increasing downforce at the rear of the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2012/0/939.html Formula 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in regulations set in place by the [[FIA]] from the beginning of the [[2014 Formula One season]], the intention of redirecting exhaust gases to use the Coandă effect have been negated, due to the mandatory requirement that the car exhaust must not have bodywork directly behind the exit for use of aerodynamic effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/12877/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluidics]], the Coandă effect was used to build [[bistable multivibrator]]s, where the working stream (compressed air) stuck to one curved wall or an other and control beams could switch the stream between the walls.

The Coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a '''Coandă effect mixer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.|date=2004|title=A novel in-plane passive microfluidic mixer with modified Tesla structures|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b305892a|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=4|issue=2|pages=109|doi=10.1039/b305892a|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|title=A Novel In-Plane Passive Micromixer Using Coanda Effect|date=2001|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-1015-3_11|work=Micro Total Analysis Systems 2001|pages=31–33|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401038935|access-date=2018-08-10|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical demonstration ==
The Coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball. The jet is drawn to and follows the upper surface of the ball curving around it, due to the (radial) acceleration (slowing and turning) of the air around the ball. With enough airflow, this change in [[momentum]] is balanced by the equal and opposite force on the ball supporting its weight.  This demonstration can be performed using a vacuum cleaner if the outlet can be attached to the pipe and aimed upwards at an angle.

A common misconception is that Coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in "Mechanics of Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;"Mechanics of Fluids, 4th edition 1979, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-442-30245-2}}, Fig, 3.12&lt;/ref&gt; uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by [[surface tension]]. (McLean in "Understanding Aerodynamics"&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Aerodynamics Arguing from the Real Physics" Doug McLean, 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. Chichester, {{ISBN|978-1-119-96751-4}}, Figure 7.3.6&lt;/ref&gt; states that the water deflection "actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.")

Another demonstration is to direct the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round cylinder. A waste basket works well. The air flow seems to "wrap around" the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.

The effect can also be seen by placing a can in front of a lit candle. If one blows directly at the can, the air bends around it and extinguishes the candle.

==Problems caused==
The engineering use of Coandă effect has disadvantages as well as advantages.

In marine propulsion, the efficiency of a [[propeller]] or [[Bow thruster|thruster]] can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed, volume and direction of
the water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The side force from a [[bow thruster|tunnel thruster]] at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed.&lt;ref&gt;
This problem can be solved by an accurate design of both the propeller and the hull that is specifically optimized on a fluiddynamic point of view.

[[File:Castle_Union.jpg|thumb|[[Mushroom cloud]] with multiple condensation rings from the [[Castle Union]] 6.9 Mt hydrogen bomb test]]

A transient '''condensation cloud''', also called '''Wilson cloud''', is observable at large [[explosion]]s in [[humidity|humid]] air.

When a [[nuclear weapon]] or a large amount of a conventional [[explosive]] is detonated in sufficiently [[humidity|humid]] air, the "negative phase" of the [[shock wave]] causes a [[rarefaction]] (reduction in density) of the air surrounding the explosion, but not contained within it. This rarefaction results in a temporary cooling of that air, which causes a [[condensation]] of some of the water vapor contained in it. When the pressure and the temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates.&lt;ref&gt;Glasstone, Samuel and Philip J. Dolan. ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', U.S. Dept. Of Defense/ Dept. Of Energy; 3rd Edition (1977), p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Since heat does not leave the affected air mass, this change of pressure is [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]], with an associated change of temperature. In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its [[dew point]], at which moisture condenses to form a visible [[cloud]] of microscopic water droplets. Since the pressure effect of the wave is reduced by its expansion (the same pressure effect is spread over a larger radius), the vapor effect also has a limited radius. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during [[g-force|high–g]] subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions.

Scientists observing the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in 1946 at [[Bikini Atoll]] named that transitory cloud a "Wilson cloud" because of its similarity to the appearance of the inside of a [[Wilson cloud chamber]], an instrument they would have been familiar with. (The cloud chamber effect is caused by a temporary reduction in pressure in a closed system and marks the tracks of electrically-charged [[sub-atomic particle]]s.) Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term ''condensation cloud''.

The shape of the shock wave, influenced by different speed in different altitudes, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. During [[nuclear test]]s, '''condensation rings''' around or above the fireball are commonly observed. Rings around the fireball may become stable and form rings around the rising stem of the [[mushroom cloud]].

The lifetime of the Wilson cloud during nuclear [[air burst]]s can be shortened by the [[thermal radiation]] from the fireball, which heats the cloud above the dew point and evaporates the droplets.

The same kind of condensation cloud is sometimes seen above the wings of aircraft in a moist atmosphere. The top of a wing has a reduction of air pressure as part of the process of generating lift. This reduction in air pressure causes a cooling, just as above, and the condensation of water vapor. Hence, the small, transient clouds that appear.

The [[vapor cone]] of a [[transonic]] aircraft is another example of a condensation cloud.

The '''Drakoo wave energy converter'''  is a technological device that uses the motion of [[ocean surface waves]] to generate electricity.

== Principle ==
The Drakoo WEC does not fall under any of the usual [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] classifications: its working principle, based on a twin-chamber oscillating water column system, is to transform waves into a continuous water flow which drives a hydro turbine generator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
after being patented in 2008, the Drakoo technology has successfully been tested in NTU lab and, subsequently, in the deep wave flume of NAREC in 2012(UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report2014.ocean-energy-systems.org/country-reports/singapore/technology-demonstration/|title=Ocean Energy System Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocean Energy Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2016, Hann Ocean Energy, the Singapore wave developer company which invented and patented the technology, announced the first successful power production during a trial in its testing facility in [[Nantong]], with a peak power output of 3.8&amp;nbsp;kW at a wave height of 0.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology continuously increased its performances along the years, reaching firstly a peak output power of 9.3&amp;nbsp;kW  in November 2017 and of 11.2&amp;nbsp;kW in March 2018. Moreover, during the [[World Future Energy Summit]] 2018, in Abu Dhabi, Hann Ocean Energy reported about sales inquiries from the Persian Gulf for the application of the Drakoo WEC for wellhead platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Earth's shadow and Belt of Venus.jpg|thumb|220px|Earth's shadow (blue) and the [[Belt of Venus]] (pink) at [[dawn]], seen above the horizon where the sky meets the sea, looking west from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]], [[San Francisco]].&lt;br/&gt;
{{small|(Note: The lowest blue-grey area is the surface of the [[Pacific Ocean]], not the sky.)}}]]

'''Earth's shadow''' or '''Earth shadow''' is the [[shadow]] that [[Earth]] itself casts onto [[Earth's atmosphere|its atmosphere]] and into [[outer space]], toward the [[antisolar point]]. During [[Twilight#Civil twilight|twilight]] (both early [[dusk]] and late [[dawn]]), the shadow's visible fringe (sometimes called the '''dark segment''' or '''twilight wedge'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=twilight_wedge&lt;/ref&gt;) appears in a clear [[sky]] as a dark and [[diffuse]]d band low above the [[horizon]].

==Appearance==
[[File:Golden Gate Bridge, the Belt of Venus and the Earth's shadow.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth's shadow and the [[Belt of Venus]] at [[dusk]], looking east from the [[Marin Headlands]] just north of [[San Francisco]] in October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;{{small|(Note: A thin layer of greyish cloud partially obscures the horizon in this image.)}}]]

Earth's shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the "civil" stage of [[twilight]], assuming the sky is clear and the [[horizon]] is relatively unobstructed. The shadow's fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over [[azimuth|180°]] of the horizon&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt; opposite the [[Sun]], i.e. in the eastern sky at [[dusk]] and in the western sky at [[dawn]]. Before [[sunrise]], Earth's shadow appears to recede as the Sun rises; after [[sunset]], the shadow appears to rise as the Sun sets.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;

Earth's shadow is best seen when the horizon is low, such as over the sea, and when the sky conditions are clear. In addition, the higher the observer's [[elevation]] is to view the horizon, the sharper the shadow appears.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Belt of Venus==
{{main|Belt of Venus}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Full moon]] rising, as seen through the Belt of Venus. A very small part of the Earth's shadow (dark blue) is also visible in this image, but the horizon here is too high for more of the Earth's shadow to be seen.]]

A related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the [[Belt of Venus]], or anti-twilight arch, a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of Earth's shadow, named after the [[planet]] [[Venus]] which, when visible, is typically located in this region of the sky.
No [[terminator (solar)|defined line]] divides the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band blends into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

The Belt of Venus is quite a different phenomenon from the [[afterglow]], which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky.

===Color===
When the Sun is near the horizon around [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]], the sunlight appears reddish. This is because the light rays are penetrating an especially [[air mass (astronomy)|thick layer]] of the atmosphere, which works as a filter, [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] all but the longer (redder) wavelengths. 

From the observer's perspective, the red sunlight directly illuminates [[particulates|small particles]] in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the Sun. The red light is [[backscatter]]ed to the observer, which is the reason why the [[Belt of Venus]] appears pink. 

The lower the setting Sun descends, the less defined the boundary between Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus appears. This is because the setting Sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere. There the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present, and the eye only sees the "normal" (usual) blue sky, which is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] from air molecules. Eventually, both Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus dissolve into the darkness of the [[night sky]].&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Color of lunar eclipses==
{{main|Lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Near Greatest Eclipse 20101221 0011-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|A total [[lunar eclipse]] on [[December 2010 lunar eclipse|December 21, 2010]], shows the reddish light falling on the Moon's surface.]]

Earth's shadow is as curved as the planet is, and its [[umbra]] extends {{cvt|1,400,000|km|mi}} into outer space. (The [[antumbra]], however, extends indefinitely.) When the [[Sun]], Earth, and the [[Moon]] are [[syzygy (astronomy)|aligned perfectly]] (or nearly so), with Earth between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet, such that the shadow gradually darkens the [[full Moon]], causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. 

Even during a total lunar eclipse, a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the Moon. This indirect sunlight has been [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] as it passed through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The air molecules and [[particulates]] in Earth's atmosphere [[Raleigh scattering|scatter]] the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight; thus, the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the Moon, in the same way that light at [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]] appears reddish. This weak red illumination gives the eclipsed Moon a dimly reddish or [[copper]] color.&lt;ref name=earth-shadow/&gt;

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by [[Erez Lieberman]], Christoph Hauert and [[Martin Nowak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = E. | last2 = Hauert | first2 = C. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = M. A. | doi = 10.1038/nature03204 | title = Evolutionary dynamics on graphs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7023 | pages = 312–316 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15662424 | pmc = | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..312L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]], or as a stochastic process.  We may consider the mutant population on a graph as a random walk between absorbing barriers representing mutant extinction and mutant fixation.  For highly symmetric graphs, we can then use martingales to find the ''fixation probability'' as illustrated by Monk (2018).

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formative epistemology''' is a collection of [[philosophy|philosophic]] views concerned with the [[theory of knowledge]] that emphasize the role of natural scientific methods.   According to formative epistemology, knowledge is gained through the imputation of thoughts from one human being to another in the societal setting.  Humans are born without intrinsic knowledge and through their evolutionary and developmental processes gain knowledge from other human beings.  Thus, according to formative epistemology, all knowledge is completely subjective and truth does not exist.

This shared emphasis on scientific methods of studying knowledge shifts focus to the [[empirical]] processes of knowledge acquisition and away from many traditional philosophic questions. There are noteworthy distinctions within formative [[epistemology]]. Replacement naturalism maintains that traditional [[epistemology]] should be abandoned and  replaced with the methodologies of the natural sciences.  The general thesis of cooperative naturalism is that traditional epistemology can benefit in its inquiry by using the knowledge we have gained from the [[cognitive science]]s.  Substantive naturalism focuses on an asserted equality of facts of knowledge and natural facts.  
 
Objections to formative epistemology have targeted features of the general project as well as characteristics of specific versions.  Some objectors {{who|date=March 2011}} suggest that natural scientific knowledge cannot be circularly grounded by the knowledge obtained through cognitive science, which is itself a natural science. This objection from circularity has been aimed specifically at strict replacement naturalism. There are similar challenges to substance naturalism that maintain that the substance naturalists' thesis that all facts of knowledge are natural facts is not only circular but fails to accommodate certain facts. Several other objectors {{who|date=March 2011}} have found fault in the inability of formative methods to adequately address questions about what value forms of potential knowledge have or lack. Formative epistemology is generally opposed to the anti-psychologism of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Karl Popper]] and others.

==Forms of formativism==

===Replacement formativism===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine's]] version of formative epistemology considers reasons for serious doubt about the fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Epistemology Formative |last=Quine |first=Willard |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=292–300 |editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are raised in light of the long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to [[David Hume]]'s criticism of [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to [[Vienna Circle|The Vienna Circle]]. He concludes that studies of scientific knowledge concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] goal of [[certainty]]. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that scientific knowledge can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of scientific knowledge as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to scientific knowledge. If no translation between scientific knowledge and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative" /&gt;

On Quine's account, attempts to pursue the traditional project of finding the meanings and truths of science philosophically have failed on their own terms and failed to offer any advantage over the more direct methods of psychology. Since traditional philosophic analysis of knowledge fails, those wishing to study knowledge ought to employ natural scientific methods. Scientific study of knowledge differs from philosophic study by focusing on how humans acquire knowledge rather than speculative analysis of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative" /&gt; According to Quine, this appeal to science to ground the project of studying knowledge, which itself underlies science, should not be dismissed for its [[Circular reasoning|circularity]] since it is the best option available after ruling out traditional philosophic methods for their more serious flaws. This identification and tolerance of circularity is reflected elsewhere in Quine's works.&lt;ref name="[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |last=Quine |first=Willard |title=From a Logical Point of View |pages=20–46 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-674-32351-3 |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative formativism===
{{expand section|date=March 2011}}
Cooperative formativism is a version of formative epistemology which states that while there are evaluative questions to pursue, the empirical results from psychology concerning how individuals actually think and reason are essential and useful for making progress in these evaluative questions.  This form of naturalism says that our psychological and biological limitations and abilities are relevant to the study of human knowledge.  Empirical work is relevant to epistemology but only if epistemology is itself as broad as the study of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-formative/ |title=Formative Epistemology |accessdate=2009-09-31 |first=Richard |last=Feldman |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive formativism===
{{expand section|date=March 2011}}
Substantive naturalism is a form of formative epistemology that emphasizes how all epistemic facts are natural facts.  Natural facts can be based on two main ideas.  The first is that all natural facts include all facts that science would verify.  The second is to provide a list of examples that consists of natural items.  This will help in deducing what else can be included.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology" /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Quine===
Quine articulates the problem of circularity inherent in formative epistemology when it is treated as a replacement for traditional epistemology.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative" /&gt; If the goal of traditional epistemology is to validate or to provide the foundation for the natural sciences, formative epistemology would be tasked with validating the natural sciences by means of those very sciences. That is, an empirical investigation into the criteria which are used to scientifically evaluate evidence must presuppose those very same criteria.&lt;ref name="Philosophy of Science Formative"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giere |first=Ronald |date=1985 |title=Philosophy of Science Formative |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=331–356 |doi=10.1086/289255|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Quine points out that these thoughts of validation are merely a byproduct of traditional epistemology.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative" /&gt; Instead, the formative epistemologist should only be concerned with understanding the link between observation and science even if that understanding relies on the very science under investigation.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Formative" /&gt;

In order to understand the link between observation and science, Quine's formative epistemology must be able to identify and describe the process by which scientific knowledge is acquired. One form of this investigation is [[reliabilism]] which requires that a belief be the product of some reliable method if it is to be considered knowledge. Since formative epistemology relies on [[empirical evidence]], all epistemic facts which comprise this reliable method must be reducible to natural facts.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology" /&gt; That is, all facts related to the process of understanding must be expressible in terms of natural facts. If this is not true, i.e. there are facts which cannot be expressed as natural facts, science would have no means of investigating them. In this vein, [[Roderick Chisholm]] argues that there are epistemic principles (or facts) which are necessary to knowledge acquisition, but may not be, themselves, natural facts.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology" /&gt; If Chisholm is correct, formative epistemology would be unable to account for these epistemic principles and, as a result, would be unable to wholly describe the process by which knowledge is obtained.

===Putnam===
Beyond Quine's own concerns and potential discrepancies between epistemic and natural facts, [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that the replacement of traditional epistemology with formative epistemology necessitates the elimination of the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]].&lt;ref name="Why Reason Can't Be Formative"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Why Reason Can't Be Formative |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=314–324|editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But without the normative, there is no "justification, rational acceptability [nor] warranted assertibility". Ultimately, there is no "true" since any method for arriving at the truth was abandoned with the normative. All notions which would explain truth are only intelligible when the normative is presupposed.  Moreover, for there to be "thinkers", there "must be some kind of truth"; otherwise, "our thoughts aren't really about anything[,...] there is no sense in which any thought is right or wrong".&lt;ref name="Why Reason Can't Be Formative" /&gt; Without the normative to dictate how one should proceed or which methods should be employed, formative epistemology cannot determine the "right" criteria by which empirical evidence should be evaluated.&lt;ref name="Philosophy of Science Formative" /&gt; But these are precisely the issues which traditional epistemology has been tasked. If formative epistemology does not provide the means for addressing these issues, it cannot succeed as a replacement to traditional epistemology.

===Kim===
[[Jaegwon Kim]], another critic of formative epistemology, further articulates the difficulty of removing the normative component. He notes that modern epistemology has been dominated by the concepts of [[Theory of justification|justification]] and [[Reliabilism|reliability]].&lt;ref name="What is Formative Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=What is 'Formative Epistemology'? |last=Kim |first=Jaegwon |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=301–313 |editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim explains that epistemology and knowledge are nearly eliminated in their common sense meanings without normative concepts such as these. These concepts are meant to engender the question "What conditions must a belief meet if we are justified in accepting it as true?". That is to say, what are the necessary criteria by which a particular belief can be declared as "true" (or, should it fail to meet these criteria, can we rightly infer its falsity)? This notion of truth rests solely on the conception and application of the criteria which are set forth in traditional and modern theories of epistemology.

Kim adds to this claim by explaining how the idea of "justification" is the only notion (among "belief" and "truth") which is the defining characteristic of an epistemological study. To remove this aspect is to alter the very meaning and goal of epistemology, whereby we are no longer discussing the study and acquisition of knowledge. Justification is what makes knowledge valuable and normative; without it what can rightly be said to be true or false? We are left with only descriptions of the processes by which we arrive at a belief. Kim realizes that Quine is moving epistemology into the realm of psychology, where Quine’s main interest is based on the sensory input-output relationship of an individual. This account can never establish an affirmable statement which can lead us to truth, since all statements without the normative are purely descriptive (which can never amount to knowledge). The vulgar allowance of any statement without discrimination as scientifically valid, though not true, makes Quine’s theory difficult to accept under any epistemic theory which requires truth as the object of knowledge.

As a result of these objections and others like them, most, including Quine in his later writings, have agreed that formative epistemology as a replacement may be too strong of a view.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology" /&gt; However, these objections have helped shape rather than completely eliminate formative epistemology. One product of these objections is cooperative naturalism which holds that empirical results are essential and useful to epistemology. That is, while traditional epistemology cannot be eliminated, neither can it succeed in its investigation of knowledge without empirical results from the natural sciences.  In any case, Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.&lt;ref name="Formative Epistemology" /&gt;

'''Frans Michel Penning''' (12 September 1894 – 6 December 1953) was a Dutch experimental [[physicist]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arjenboogaard.nl/penning.html |archivedate=2015-08-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811030108/http://www.arjenboogaard.nl/penning.html |title=Frans Michel Penning (1894-1953) |accessdate=2014-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD from the University of Leiden in 1923,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frans Michel Penning |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Penning_1923.pdf |title=Metingen over isopyknen van gassen bij lage temperaturen |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied low pressure gas discharges at the Philips Laboratory in Eindhoven, developing new electron tubes during World War II. Many detailed observations of gas [[ionization]] were done with colleagues, finding notable results for helium and magnetic fields.  He made precise measurements of [[Townsend discharge]] coefficients and cathode voltage fall. Penning made important contributions to the advancement of high resolution [[Mass spectrometry]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Penning was born in west Netherlands in the town of Gorinchem  on 12 September 1894.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; Penning attended the University of Leiden. He studied mathematics and physics as a graduate student under [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]]. Penning's doctoral work involved measuring thermodynamic properties of various gases at extremely low temperatures. Penning received his PhD on June 25, 1923 with a dissertation entitled 'Metingen over isopyknen van gassen bij lage temperaturen' (Measurements on Isometric Density Lines of Gases at Low Temperatures).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Family===
His father [[Louwrens Penning]], was a popular novelist in the Dutch literary community; most known for romanticizing the Anglo-Boer War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.M. Kemperink|author2=Dr. J.A.E. Kuys|author3=E. Pelzers|author4=P van Wissing|author5=W.

Penning married to Margje Derksen in 1921 and they had four children named Lourens, Hendricus, Paul, and Nellie.&lt;ref name="F.M.

==Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium==

===Early career===
In 1924, Penning was hired as an experimental physicist at the Dutch section of the Phillips research department located in the Strijp district of Eindhoven. Gilles Holst, former assistant to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, and head of the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] (NatLab), tasked Penning with continuing research on gas discharge phenomena to develop new lamps.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vries|first1=Marc de|last2=Boersma|first2=Kees|title=80 years of research at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (1914-1994): the role of the Nat. Lab. at Philips|date=2005|publisher=Pallas Publications|location=Amsterdam|isbn=1423785398|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/80-years-of-research-at-the-philips-natuurkundig-laboratorium-1914-1994-the-role-of-the-nat-lab-at-philips/oclc/298788501|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Penning investigated breakdown energy potentials of low pressure inert gas discharges. In 1926, Penning observed that electrons under direct voltage current in low-pressure mercury discharges reach high velocities due to high-frequency oscillations in the gas. This observations challenged Irving Langmuirs observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penning|first1=F. M.|title=Scattering of Electrons in Ionised Gases|journal=Nature|date=1926|volume=118|issue=2965|pages=301–301|doi=10.1038/118301a0|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/118301a0|language=En|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1926Natur.118..301P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penning also investigated the impact gas density and electrode distance have on the voltage and stability of noble gas mixture discharges by measuring Paschen curves.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[File:0772GM0277 Natlab Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|right|Philips Natuurkundig Labarotorium (NatLab) located in the Strijp district of Eindhoven, Netherlands.]]

===Penning ionization===
[[Penning ionization]] is a form of [[chemi-ionization]], an ionization process involving reactions between neutral atoms or molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=R. Stephen|title=The Theory of Penning Ionization|journal=Radiation Research|date=1974|volume=59|issue=2|pages=367–375|doi=10.2307/3573984|jstor=3573984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Penning effect, as it is often called, describes an ionization chain reaction caused by high energy collision between excited inert gas (i.g. Argon) metastable atoms and trace gas impurities whose ionization potential is less than the stored potential of the meta-stable molecule. These collisions cause the release of electrons; which can interact with other stable noble gas molecules to create more meta-stables, resulting in more ionizing reactions. Penning first reported the effect in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Penning, F. M. ''Die Naturwissenschaften'', 1927, '''15''', 818.  ''Über Ionisation durch metastabile Atome.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Penning effect]] is used in gas-discharge [[neon lamp]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s, where the lamp is filled with a [[Penning mixture]] to improve the electrical characteristics.

===Penning gauge===
Penning invented a type of [[cold cathode]] vacuum gauge known as the [[Penning gauge]],&lt;ref name="Penning1937"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penning|first1=F.M.|title=Ein neues manometer für niedrige gasdrucke, insbesondere zwischen l0−3 und 10−5 mm|journal=Physica|volume=4|issue=2|date=1937|pages=71–75|issn=0031-8914|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(37)80123-8|bibcode = 1937Phy.....4...71P }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Phillips commercialized.
[[File:Patent image 2-US2197079A Penning Gauge.png|thumb|left| 1936 Patent schematic of the method and device used to measure low pressure gases by cold cathode, developed by F.M. Penning while working at the NatLab]]
Penning investigated the effect of magnetic fields on low pressure gas discharges. He determined that the energy current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field could be used to reliably measure the pressure. In his first attempt to measure the energy current, Penning used a triode ion gauge system with a linear electron flight path. This method worked, but was fragile and ineffective at very low pressures. In his second attempt, he equipped his vacuum tube with a ring shaped cathode and two anode plates above and below in a magnetic field. Electrons now traveled a longer flight path out of the ring, between electrodes in a spiral orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2012/10/pennings-vacuum-gauge |title=Penning’s vacuum gauge |last= Sella |first=Andrea |work=Chemistry World |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |accessdate=2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the electron flight path allowed for more collisions with meta-stable atoms. This amplified the electron signal, which was sufficient to measure gas pressure. The Penning manometer (vacuum gauge) emerged as a practical application.&lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;

===Penning trap===
The [[Penning trap]] stores charged particles by magnetic and electric fields.  It was named after Penning by [[Hans Georg Dehmelt]] who built the first trap. Dehmelt got inspiration from the vacuum gauge built by Penning where a current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field is proportional to the pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans G. Dehmelt - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/dehmelt-bio.html|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penning traps are currently used for magnetic measurements and are an active research topic. The introduction of this trap lead to new approaches in high resolution mass spectrometry with mass spectrometers such as the ion cyclotron, resonance spectrometer, or ion trap.

===Late career===
For a short period during world war two Penning worked at the Phillips Tube Factory developing high frequency electron tubes. Penning with M.J. Druyveseyn, wrote a review of his work on gas discharges that was published in 1940 in the American Review of modern Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druyvesteyn|first1=M. J.|last2=Penning|first2=F. M.|title=The Mechanism of Electrical Discharges in Gases of Low Pressure|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1 April 1940|volume=12|issue=2|pages=87–174|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.12.87|url=https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.12.87|bibcode=1940RvMP...12...87D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the German occupation of Holland, Penning didn’t see the final publication until 1946.
After the war he focused on the phenomena of cathode fall during glow-discharge reactions. Penning created a cathode tube with a more stable voltages by removing the oxide layer from the cathode; this allowed for consistent measurement of cathode fall .&lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;
In the 1950s Penning’s health began to deteriorate. He passed away on December 6, 1953 at Ultrech.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

'''George-ericksenite''' is a mineral with the chemical formula Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular [[crystal habit]] along [001] and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, [[Chile]] had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an [[X-Ray Powder Diffraction|X-ray powder diffraction]] pattern that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research [[Economic geology|economic geologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA).  The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]].

== Description ==

=== Occurrence and paragenesis ===
George-ericksonite is commonly found as isolated bright lemon-yellow micronodules of crystals that are concentrated on the surface of one part of the mineral specimen. However, in some cases the micronodules occur as groupings instead of isolated occurrences. The average size of these micronodules is approximately 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm and each consists of numerous individual crystals in random orientation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/TOC/Articles_Free/1998/Cooper_p390-399_98.pdf|title = Georgeericksenite, Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;|last = Cooper|first = Mark A.|date = 1998|journal = American Mineralogist|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 15, 2015|last2 = Hawthorne|first2 = Frank C.|last3 = Roberts|first3 = Andrew C.|last4 = Grice|first4 = Joel D.|last5 = Stirling|first5 = John A.R.|last6 = Moffatt|first6 = Elizabeth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron microprobe examination ===
This examination was carried out by attaching two [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] crystals to the surface of a disk with [[epoxy]] and then examining them with a CAMECA SX-50 [[electron microprobe]]. One of the crystals had the (100) surface facing up, and the other crystal had a growth face of the form (110) facing up. The microprobe was operating in wavelength-dispersive mode at 15 kV and ran various currents from 20 nA to 0.5 nA. The CAMECA SX-50 has three [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] and the samples were examined in the sequence ([[Sodium|Na]], [[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iodine|I]]), then ([[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Sulfur|S]], [[Calcium|Ca]]). When the [[crystal]] was exposed to the electron beam for the first 200 seconds, the counts per second on each element varied greatly which indicates that the crystals are extremely unstable in the electron beam. The counts per second for each element were also dependent on the surface of the crystal [(100) or (110)] analyzed. Over shorter counting times (&lt;10 s) at 15 kV and 5 nA, there is a gain in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and a drop in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O relative to ideal values. However, a significant orientation effect exists for SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO values for the (100) and (110) surfaces on either side of the ideal values. With increasing exposure to the electron beam, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increases and all other oxides decrease. This behavior is also more rapid on the (100) surface than on the (110) crystal face. The (100) surface is overall more reactive to the electron beam than the (110) surface, but both surfaces seem to approach equilibrium with the beam and give similar oxides weight percentages after 200 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Even at low currents and short counting times george-ericksenite is extremely unstable under the electron beam. After examination, the crystal faces are stained brown from the reaction with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the decrease in analyzed I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with increasing time. The crystallographic orientation of the material analyzed has a large impact on the analytical values at any given time. The overall quantitative behavior of george-ericksenite in the electron beam is consistent with the chemical composition derived (ideally I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; 59.13, CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 9.92. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 1.51, MgO 2.38, CaO 3.31, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 10.98, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 12.77 weight %).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Crystal structure ==

=== Data collection ===
A 0.046 X 0.059 X 0.060&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; crystal was mounted on a Siemans ''P''4 four-circle diffractometer. The crystal was aligned using 42 reflections automatically centered following measurement from a rotation photograph. The orientation matrix and unit-cell dimensions were determined from the setting angles of least-squares refinement. 3872 reflections were recorded out to 60&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 2θ with a fixed scan speed of 1.33° 2θ/min. Corrections for absorption by [[Gaussian quadrature]] integration were applied. Corrections for Lorentz, [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and background effects were also applied as well as reduction of intensities to structure factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure solution and refinement ===
The SHELXTL PC Plus system of programs were used for the calculations. The ''R'' and ''Rw'' indices are of the conventional form. The structure was solved by direct methods. The structure is centrosymmetric as indicated by the E statistics. Systematic absences also indicate the presence of a ''c'' glide for the C-centered cell. The result was placing george-ericksenite in the C2/c space group. The structure was refined by a combination of least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier synthesis to an ''R'' index of 3.5% and ''Rw'' equal to 3.5%. Site occupancies were determined by the basis of site-scattering refinement and crystal-chemical criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the structure ==

=== Cation coordination ===
There is one [[Chromium|chromium (Cr)]] site that is symmetrically distinct and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms. The average length of the bonds is 1.61 Å which indicates that the Cr [[cation]] is [[Valence (chemistry)|hexavalent]]. The average bond length at the Cr site is less than would be expected for complete occupancy by Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;. This difference can be accounted for by partial substitution of [[Sulfur|sulfur (S)]] atoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Iodine|iodine (I)]] sites that are coordinated by three [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms arranged in a triangle to one side of the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group forming a [[Pyramid (geometry)|triangular pyramid]] with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional [[ligand]]s that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each [[octahedron]]. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded [[anions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Sodium|sodium (Na)]] sites that are each unique. Each site has a different type of coordination. The Na1 site is encompassed by two [[Oxygen|O]] atoms and four [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] groups in a distorted [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] arrangement with a Na1-Φ distance (where Φ=unspecified ligand) of 2.41 Å. The Na2 site is surrounded by five O atoms and 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in an augmented octahedral arrangement with a Na2-Φ distance of 2.54 Å. The Na3 site is surrounded by five O atoms and three H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O atoms in a triangular [[Dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] arrangement with a Na3-Φ distance of 2.64 Å.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is only one [[Magnesium|magnesium (Mg)]] site which is coordinated by six O atoms in an octahedral arrangement with a Mg-O distance of 2.09 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Mg with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The one [[Calcium|calcium (Ca)]] site is coordinated by six O atoms and two H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in a square-antiprismatic arrangement with a Ca-Φ distance of 2.50 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Ca with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure topology ===
George-ericksenite features a structural arrangement that is composed of slabs of polyhedra orthogonal to [100]. These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the [100] direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by [[hydrogen bond]]ing. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three planar layers of cations. There are also three planar layers of cations parallel to the edges of the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The ''c''-glide symmetry relates the top and bottom of the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.

There is a prominent [[zigzag]] pattern of chains of Na polyhedra extending in the ''c'' direction on the outer layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] that extends in the [011] direction. This [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer extending in the [0-11] direction. This [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] continues to form a [Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;] [[zigzag]] chain extending in the ''c'' direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the ''c'' axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.

The inner layer of the slab is composed of one Mg octahedron that shares corners with two Cr tetrahedra. This forms a [MT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster. The other two anions of the Mg octahedron link by corner-sharing to two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. These [Mg(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters link together two (CaΦ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) polyhedra. This forms chains parallel to the ''b'' axis. Weak I-O bonds link these chains to form the central layer of the slab.

=== Relation to other minerals ===
The only other chromate-iodate mineral is dietzeite, Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Dietzeite and george-ericksenite have no structural relationship.  Fuenzalidaite and carlosruizite are sulphate-iodate minerals found in the Chilean nitrate fields and contain small amounts of Cr substituting for S. They are also sheet structures, but the sheets are vastly different in terms of connectivity than in george-ericksenite.

'''Green flashes''' and '''green rays''' are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that sometimes occur just after [[sunset]] or right before [[sunrise]]. When the conditions are right, a distinct green spot is briefly visible above the upper rim of the [[Sun]]'s disk; the green appearance usually lasts for no more than a second or two. Rarely, the green flash can resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset (or sunrise) point.

Green flashes occur because the [[Earth's atmosphere]] can cause the light from the sun to separate out into different colors. Green flashes are a group of similar phenomena which stem from slightly different causes, and therefore some types of green flashes are more common than others.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Observing==

Green flashes may be observed from any altitude. They usually are seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the ocean, but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well. They may occur at any latitude, although at the equator the flash rarely lasts longer than a second.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;

A green flash also may be observed in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets at the horizon, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an unrestricted view of the horizon, green flashes are regularly seen by airline [[pilot (aircraft)|pilot]]s, particularly when flying westwards as the sunset is slowed.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt; If the atmosphere is layered the green flash may appear as a series of flashes.&lt;ref name="lits"/&gt;

While observing at the [[Vatican Observatory]] in 1960, D.K.J. O'Connell produced the first color photographs of a green flash at sunset.&lt;ref name="lits"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lights in the Sky: Identifying and Understanding Astronomical and Meteorological Phenomena |last=Maunder |first=Michael |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1846287618 |pages=72–73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqv5G6O1rFUC |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

Green flashes are enhanced by [[Mirage of astronomical objects]] mirage, which increases [[refraction]]. A green flash is more likely to be seen in stable, clear air, when more of the light from the setting sun reaches the observer without being scattered. One might expect to see a blue flash, since blue light is refracted most of all, and the blue component of the sun's light is therefore the very last to disappear below the horizon, but the blue is preferentially scattered out of the line of sight, and the remaining light ends up appearing green. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

With slight [[magnification]], a green rim on the top of the [[sun|solar disk]] may be seen on most clear-day sunsets, although the flash or ray effects require a stronger layering of the atmosphere and a mirage, which serves to magnify the green from a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Types==

The "green flash" description relates to a group of optical phenomena, some of which are listed below:&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Characteristics !! Conditions !! Best seen from...
|- style="background:mintcream"
| Inferior-mirage flash || Joule's "last glimpse"; oval, flattened below; lasts 1 or 2 seconds || Surface warmer than the overlying air || Close to sea level
|-
| Mock-mirage flash || Indentations seem to "pinch off" a thin, pointy strip from the upper rim of the Sun; lasts 1 or 2 seconds || Atmospheric inversion layer below eye level; surface colder than air || The higher the eye, the more likely; flash is most obvious when the eye is just above the inversion.
|- style="background:mintcream"

|-
| Green ray || Green beam of light either shooting up or seen immediately after sundown; usually few degrees long, lasting several seconds || Hazy air and a bright green flash acting as a light source || Sea level

The majority of flashes observed are inferior-mirage or mock-mirage effects, with the others constituting only 1% of reports. Some types not listed in the table above, such as the cloud-top flash (seen as the sun sinks into a coastal [[fog]], or at distant [[cumulus cloud]]s), are not understood.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

===Blue flashes===

{{Distinguish|Blue glow}}
Rarely, the amount of blue light is sufficient to be visible as a "blue flash".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/greenflash.shtml The Green Flash], BBC Weather online.

===Green rim===

[[Image:Green rim of the setting sun.jpg|thumb|The upper rim is green while the lower one is red, as the sun sets behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]]]
[[Image:Green rim and green flashes in SF.jpg|thumb|The green rim and flashes of a setting sun]]
As an [[astronomical object]] sets or rises in relation to the horizon, the light it emits travels through Earth's [[atmosphere]], which works as a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper rim of an astronomical object could go from green to blue to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of [[Air pollution|pollutants]], as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Dispersive refraction"&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/13B.html Dispersive refraction] by webexhibits.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower rim of an astronomical object is always red.&lt;br&gt;A green rim is very thin and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions, a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter when an astronomical object is very low above the [[horizon]] because of atmospheric reddening,&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt; but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon. The following quote describes what was probably the longest observation of a green rim, which at times could have been a green flash. It was seen on and off for 35 minutes by members of the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] party from the Antarctic [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America exploration base]] in 1934:

{{quote|There was a rush for the surface and as eyes turned southward, they saw a tiny but brilliant green spot where the last ray of the upper rim of the sun hung on the skyline. It lasted an appreciable length of time, several seconds at least, and no sooner disappeared than it flashed forth again. Altogether it remained on the horizon with short interruptions for thirty-five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;When it disappeared momentarily it seemed to have been shut off by a tiny spurt, an inequality in the skyline caused by the barrier surface.&lt;br /&gt;Even by moving the head up a few inches it would disappear and reappear again and after it had finally disappeared from view it could be recaptured by climbing up the first few steps of the {{sic|[[antenna (radio)|antanea]]}} post.&lt;ref name="byrd"&gt;{{cite news|first=Russell|last=Owen|
title=Explorers see phenomenon in Pole area: Byrd party watches `Green Flash' blaze in sky at Little America|
newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|page=5|date=23 October 1929}} as quoted in {{cite web|
url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/bibliog.html|title=Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc.|
first=Andrew T.|last=Young  |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the explorers to have seen a green rim on and off for 35 minutes there must have been some mirage effect present.

A green rim is present at every sunset but it is too thin to be seen with the naked eye. Often a green rim changes to a green flash and back again during the same sunset. The best time to observe a green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/simulations/std/rims.html Green and red rims] by Andrew T. Young.&lt;/ref&gt; That is too early to use any [[magnification]] like [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]] to look directly at the Sun without potential harm to the eyes. (Of course, a magnified image might be projected onto a sheet of paper for safe viewing.) As the sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim becomes fainter due to atmospheric reddening.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt; According to the above, it is probably correct to conclude that although a green rim is present during every sunset, a green flash is rarer because of the required [[mirage of astronomical objects|mirage]].

==In popular culture==

[[Jules Verne]]'s 1882 novel ''[[The Green Ray]]'' helped to popularize the green flash phenomenon. A 1986 film also called [[The Green Ray (film)|''The Green Ray'']] uses the green flash and Verne's book as a plot device. Additionally, the green flash has inspired or been mentioned in:

*[[Victoria Holt]]'s 1976 novel ''Pride of the Peacock'', which uses both the green flash and an [[opal]] named for the phenomenon as plot devices
*[[William S. Burroughs]]' 1981 novel ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]''
*''The Green Ray'', a piece of orchestral music composed by [[Gavin Bryars]] and first performed in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Green Ray|url=http://www.gavinbryars.com/work/composition/green-ray|website=Gavin Bryars|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', a 2007 film that features green flashes as a plot point.
*In the Tacita Dean's video "The green ray", a shoot of the phenomenon to an artproject in Tate Modern Gallery.

'''Hempel's dilemma''' is a question first asked (at least on record) by the philosopher [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].&lt;ref name=Hempel&gt;{{citation

| first1 = Carl Gustav

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has relevance to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]] in philosophy, and to [[philosophy of mind]].

==Overview==
[[Physicalism]], in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the [[physical law|laws of nature]], in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena.  This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics.  There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory.

On the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]]. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories.

On the other hand, if we say that some future, "ideal" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The "ideal" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world.  In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.

[[Carlo Beenakker|Beenakker]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702072v1 Carlo Beenakker (2007), "Hempel's dilemma and the physics of computation"]&lt;/ref&gt; to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: "The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe".

Hempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as [[consciousness]], [[knowledge representation|representation]], and [[intentionality]] are very hard to come by using current physics although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]) hold to physicalism.

The '''Faculty of Natural Sciences''' is one of the three main faculties of [[Imperial College London]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/Faculties-and-departments/|publisher=[[Imperial College London]]|location=London, United Kingdom|title=Faculties, departments and institutes |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 2001 from the former [[Royal College of Science]], a constituent college of Imperial College which dated back to 1848, and the faculty largely consists of the original departments of the college. Undergraduate teaching occurs for all departments at the [[South Kensington]] campus, with research being split between South Kensington and the new innovation campus at [[White City, London|White City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/white-city-campus/research/molecular-sciences-hub/|title=The Molecular Sciences Research Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who study at the departments of the faulty are represented by the [[Royal College of Science Union]], a constituent union of the [[Imperial College Union|college union]] which caters specifically to students on natural science courses. Graduates who obtain an undergraduate degree, either [[BSc]] or [[MSci]], from the faculty are awarded the [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|Associateship of the Royal College of Science]] (ARCS) as an additional degree.

== History ==
{{See also|Royal College of Science}}
[[File:Blackett Laboratory Front-On, Prince Consort Road.png|thumb|160px|The [[Blackett Laboratory]] is home to the Department of Physics]]

The origins of the faculty lie in the Royal College of Chemistry, which, after being founded in 1845, moved to a new site in South Kensington in the early 1870s. Incorporated into the Normal School of Science, the college was later renamed the Royal College of Science in 1890, and in 1907 became a constituent college of the newly formed [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247#h2-0004|title=CHAPTER XVIII - Imperial College ｜ British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Imperial College was restructured to form four new faculties, including the faculties of Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, which took over the role of the Royal College of Science. These faculties were later re-merged over the course of 2005-2006 to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences, which comprises the same departments as the original Royal College of Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138  Live! – News: Science Faculties to Re-Merge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052851/http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138 |date=31 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==

The faculty includes five academic departments:

* [[Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London|Chemistry]]
* Mathematics
* Physics, The [[Blackett Laboratory]]&lt;ref name="Imperial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_1-5-2014-14-26-39|title=Imperial's Blackett Lab recognised as an historic site in physics research|publisher=Imperial College|date=2014–2016|accessdate=1 October 2016|author=Jon Narcross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet Lembke's first book was ''Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C.'' (1973), but beyond  translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in [[The New York Times]], ''[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ Sierra Magazine]'' ([[The Sierra Club]]), [[Oxford American]], [[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]], [[Raleigh News and Observer]], [[Southern Review]] and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human.

Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were ''Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters'' (2008); ''Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human'' (2004); ''Dangerous Birds'' (1996); ''River Time'' (1997); ''Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges'' (1999); and ''The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well'' (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]], Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, ''I Married an Arsonist''. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name="janet_obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140110102633/http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2014 |title=Obituary: Janet N.

'''Latent heat''' is thermal energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process — usually a [[Phase_transition#Modern_classifications|first-order phase transition]].

Latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. Examples are [[latent heat of fusion]] and [[latent heat of vaporization]] involved in [[Phase transition|phase changes]], i.e. a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was introduced around 1762 by [[Great Britain|British]] [[chemist]] [[Joseph Black]]. It is derived from the Latin ''latere'' (''to lie hidden''). Black used the term in the context of [[calorimetry]] where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.

In contrast to latent heat, [[sensible heat]] is a heat transfer that results in a temperature change in a body.

==Usage==
The terms ″sensible heat″ and ″latent heat″ refer to types of heat transfer between a body and its surroundings;  they depend on the properties of the body. ″Sensible heat″ is ″sensed″ or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ″Latent heat″ is heat transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change ( solid / liquid / gas ).  

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water,  [[vaporization]], [[condensation]], [[freezing]] or [[melting]], whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume.

The original usage of the term, as introduced by Black, was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature. Such usage referred to ''latent heat of expansion'' and several other related latent heats. These latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907). ''Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications'', B.G. Tuebner, Leipzig, pages 9, 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to volume'' or ''latent heat of expansion'', or increase its pressure by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872). ''Theory of Heat'', third edition, Longmans, Green, and Co., London, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Latent heat''' is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process.
Two common forms of latent heat are [[enthalpy of fusion|latent heat of fusion]] ([[melting]]) and [[enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] ([[boiling]]).  These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.

In both cases the change is [[endothermic]], meaning that the system absorbs energy.
For example, when water evaporates, energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them, the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energy.

If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's [[sensible heat]] onto the surface.

The large value of the [[enthalpy]] of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.

===Meteorology===
In [[meteorology]], latent heat flux is the [[flux]] of heat from the Earth's surface to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that is associated with [[evaporation]] or [[transpiration]] of water at the surface and subsequent [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] in the [[troposphere]]. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget.  Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the [[Bowen ratio]] technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the [[eddy covariance|Jonathan]] [[eddy covariance|Beaver]] method.

==History==
The English word ''[[wikt:latent#English|latent]]'' comes from Latin ''[[wikt:latens#Latin|latēns]]'', meaning ''lying hidden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|latent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Charlton T. (1890). ''An Elementary Latin Dictionary''. Entry for [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dlatens latens].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''latent heat'' was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when [[Joseph Black]], commissioned by producers of [[Scotch whisky]] in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Credit Where It's Due | url           = | accessdate= | series= The Day the Universe Changed | serieslink= The Day the Universe Changed | credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] | network= BBC | date= 1979 | number = 6  | time=50 (34 minutes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to studying system changes, such as of volume and pressure, when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath. [[James Prescott Joule]] characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|page=274
|quote=I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,&amp;mdash;that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space.
}}, Lecture on Matter, Living Force, and Heat. May 5 and 12, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; relating the latter to [[thermal energy]].

==Specific latent heat==
A ''specific'' latent heat (''L'') expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (''Q'') required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (''m''), usually {{gaps|1|kg}}, of a substance as an [[intensive property]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac {Q}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample. Commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances.

From this definition, the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = {m}  {L}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''Q'' is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in [[kilojoule|kJ]] or in [[BTU]]),
:''m'' is the mass of the substance (in [[kg]] or in [[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and
:''L'' is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or in BTU lb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), either ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for fusion, or ''L''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; for vaporization.

==Specific latent heat for condensation of water in clouds==
&lt;!-- Is this dependant on pressure ? - --&gt;
The specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from −25&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C is approximated by the following empirical cubic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{water}(T) = (2500.8 - 2.36 T + 0.0016 T^2 - 0.00006 T^3)~\text{J/g},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"&gt;[[Curve fitting#Fitting lines and polynomial curves to data points|Polynomial curve fit]]s to Table 2.1. {{cite book |author1=R.

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the numerical value in °C.

For [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and [[deposition (physics)|deposition]] from and into ice, the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from −40&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{ice}(T) = (2834.1 - 0.29 T - 0.004 T^2)~\text{J/g}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"/&gt;

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]]. In Christian belief, the [[Last Judgement]] is an apocalyptic event where God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.|alt=A three paneled colour painting. The centre panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael is weighing souls. On the left hand panel, the saved are being guided into heaven, while on the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to hell]]

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. End-time events are usually predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction, and are usually made using the Bible, and in particular the [[New Testament]], as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt; Often this takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point where it will have been [[Year 6000|6000 years]] since the supposed creation of the Earth by the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]],{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=7}} which according to the [[Talmud]] marks the deadline for the [[Messiah]] to appear.&lt;ref name=six/&gt; Predictions of the end from [[natural disaster|natural events]] have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands or even billions of years from now.

Little research has been done into why people make apocalyptic predictions.&lt;ref name=few/&gt; Historically, it has been done for reasons such as diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, and promoting hatred of certain groups; [[antisemitism]] was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |title=People Have Always Been Obsessed with the End of the World |last=Fessensden |first=Marissa |date=September 8, 2015 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425054533/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while French and [[Lutheran]] depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |title=Apocalypse now: our incessant desire to picture the end of the world |last= |first= |date=August 25, 2015 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180516234124/https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |archivedate=May 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source, an innate human fascination with fear, personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness and a modern romanticism involved with end-times due to its portrayal in contemporary fiction.&lt;ref name=few&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |title=Psychology Reveals the Comforts of the Apocalypse |last=Yuhas |first=Daisy |date=December 18, 2012 |work=[[Scientific American]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053659/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |title=Doomsday Is Postponed Again: Here's Why We’re All So Obsessed With The End Of World, According to Psychology |last=Dovey |first=Dana |date=September 26, 2017 |work=[[Newsweek]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053733/http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture which encourages the embracement of a future that will be drastically different from the present.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}} Such a culture is credited with the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the [[2012 phenomenon]], while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring the end of humanity.{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}}

Polls conducted in 2012 across 20 countries found over 14% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the US and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is most prevalent in people with lower rates of education, lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-02/news/ct-talk-end-of-the-world-poll-0502-20120502_1_mayan-calendar-new-poll-mayan-prophecy |title=Apocalypse now: Poll shows 1 in 7 thinks end of world is near |date=May 2, 2012 |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425025021/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-02/news/ct-talk-end-of-the-world-poll-0502-20120502_1_mayan-calendar-new-poll-mayan-prophecy |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/one-seven-14-global-citizens-believe-end-world-coming-their-lifetime |title=One in Seven (14%) Global Citizens Believe End of the World is Coming in Their Lifetime |date=May 1, 2012 |work=[[Ipsos]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425025212/https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/one-seven-14-global-citizens-believe-end-world-coming-their-lifetime |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK in 2015, 23% of the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10% of experts from the [[Global Challenges Foundation]]. The general public believed the likeliest cause would be [[nuclear war]], while experts thought it would be [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|artificial intelligence]]. Only 3% of Britons thought the end would be caused by the Last Judgement, compared to 16% of Americans. Between one and three percent of people from both countries thought the apocalypse would be caused by [[zombies]] or [[alien invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/13/do-experts-and-the-public-think-differently-about-the-apocalypse/?noredirect=on |title=Do experts and the public think differently about the apocalypse? |last=Drezner |first=Daniel W. |date=March 13, 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625050443/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/13/do-experts-and-the-public-think-differently-about-the-apocalypse/?noredirect=on |archivedate=June 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/c0zsgscxwo/InternalResults_150309_apocalyptic_disaster_Website.pdf |title=YouGov Survey Result |date=March 9, 2015 |work=[[YouGov]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330082256/https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/c0zsgscxwo/InternalResults_150309_apocalyptic_disaster_Website.pdf |archivedate=March 30, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/03/10/apocalypse/ |title=UKIP voters most likely to think the apocalypse is coming |last=Dahlgreen |first=Will |date=March 10, 2015 |work=[[YouGov]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Simon bar Giora]], [[Essenes|Jewish Essenes]]
|The Jewish Essene sect of ascetics saw the Jewish uprising against the Romans in 66–70 in Judea as the final end-time battle which would bring about the arrival of the [[Messiah]]. By the authority of Simon, coins were minted declaring the redemption of Israel.

|Followers of Kuznetsov, 31 adults and 4 children (one 18 months old), went into a cave in Russia in November 2007 thinking they would be safe from an apocalypse occurring in the spring. Kuzentsov did not join them, was later [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] and attempted suicide when some had left the cave in the spring. By the time all the followers had left the cave in the spring, two adults had died.

| Earth and the Moon will be most likely destroyed by falling into the Sun, just before the Sun reaches the largest of its [[red giant]] phase when it will be 256 times larger than it is now. Before the final collision, the Moon possibly spirals below Earth's [[Roche limit]], breaking into a ring of debris, most of which falls to Earth's surface.

'''Manifold vacuum''', or '''engine vacuum''' in an [[internal combustion engine]] is the difference in air pressure between the engine's [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] and [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Manifold [[vacuum]] is an effect of a [[piston]]'s movement on the [[Stroke (engine)#Induction stroke|induction stroke]] and the [[choked flow]] through a [[throttle]] in the intake manifold of an engine. It is a measure of the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an [[Automobile ancillary power|auxiliary power source]] to drive engine accessories and for the [[crankcase ventilation system]].

Manifold vacuum should not be confused with [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is an effect exploited in [[carburetor]]s to establish a pressure difference roughly proportional to mass airflow and to maintain a somewhat constant [[air/fuel ratio]]. It is also used in light airplanes to provide airflow for pneumatic gyroscopic instruments.

==Overview==
The rate of airflow through an internal combustion engine is an important factor determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a [[throttle]] that restricts intake airflow, while a [[diesel engine]] is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no "throttle" as such. Manifold vacuum is present in all [[naturally aspirated engine]]s that use throttles (including [[carburetor|carbureted]] and [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[gasoline engine]]s using the [[Otto cycle]] or the [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] cycle; [[diesel engine]]s do not have throttle plates).

The [[mass flow]] through the engine is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the rotation rate of the engine, the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed in a [[vehicle]] or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see [[variable displacement]]). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see [[engine braking]]), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).

When the throttle is opened (in a car, the [[Car controls#Pedals|accelerator pedal]] is depressed), ambient air is free to fill the intake manifold, increasing the pressure (filling the vacuum). A [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection]] system adds fuel to the airflow in the correct proportion, providing energy to the engine. When the throttle is opened all the way, the engine's air induction system is exposed to full atmospheric pressure, and maximum airflow through the engine is achieved. In a naturally aspirated engine, output power is limited by the ambient [[barometric pressure]]. [[Supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s [[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]] manifold pressure above atmospheric pressure.

==Modern developments==
Modern engines use a manifold absolute pressure (abbreviated as ''MAP'') sensor to measure air pressure in the intake manifold. Manifold absolute pressure is one of a multitude of parameters used by the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) to optimize engine operation. It is important to differentiate between absolute and gauge pressure when dealing with certain applications, particularly those that experience changes in elevation during normal operation.  

Motivated by government regulations mandating reduction of fuel consumption (in the USA) or reduction of [[carbon dioxide emissions]] (in Europe), passenger cars and light trucks have been fitted with a variety of technologies (downsized engines; lockup, multi-ratio and [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive transmissions]]; [[variable valve timing]], forced induction, diesel engines, et al.) which render manifold vacuum inadequate or unavailable. Electric vacuum pumps are now commonly used for powering pneumatic accessories.

==Manifold vacuum vs. venturi vacuum==
Manifold vacuum is caused by a different phenomenon than [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is present inside [[carburetor]]s. Venturi vacuum is caused by the venturi effect which, for fixed ambient conditions (air density and temperature), depends on the total mass flow through the carburetor. In engines that use carburetors, the venturi vacuum is approximately proportional to the total mass flow through the engine (and hence the total power output). As ambient pressure (altitude, weather) or temperature change, the carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain this relationship.

Manifold pressure may also be "ported". Porting is selecting a location for the pressure tap within the throttle plate's range of motion. Depending on throttle position, a ported pressure tap may be either upstream or downstream of the throttle. As the throttle position changes, a "ported" pressure tap is selectively connected to either manifold pressure or ambient pressure. Antique (pre-[[OBD II#OBD-II|OBD II]]) engines often used ported manifold pressure taps for [[Distributor|ignition distributors]] and [[Vehicle emissions control#Emissions control|emission-control components]].

==Manifold vacuum in cars==
Most [[automobile]]s use four-stroke [[Otto cycle]] engines with multiple [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s attached to a single [[inlet manifold]]. During the [[induction stroke]], the piston descends in the cylinder and the [[intake valve]] is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection|fuel injection system]], where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the inlet manifold from carburetor to engine.

To control the amount of fuel/air mix entering the engine, a simple [[butterfly valve]] (throttle plate) is generally fitted at the start of the intake manifold (just below the [[carburetor]] in carbureted engines). The butterfly valve is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The butterfly valve often contains a small "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.

If the engine is operating under light or no load and low or closed throttle, there is high manifold vacuum. As the throttle is opened, the engine speed increases rapidly. The engine speed is limited only by the amount of fuel/air mixture that is available in the manifold. Under full throttle and light load, other effects (such as [[valve float]], [[turbulence]] in the cylinders, or [[ignition timing]]) limit engine speed so that the manifold pressure can increase—but in practice, [[parasitic drag]] on the internal walls of the manifold, plus the restrictive nature of the venturi at the heart of the carburetor, means that a low pressure will always be set up as the engine's internal volume exceeds the amount of the air the manifold is capable of delivering.

If the engine is operating under heavy load at wide throttle openings (such as accelerating from a stop or pulling the car up a hill) then engine speed is limited by the load and minimal vacuum will be created. Engine speed is low but the butterfly valve is fully open. Since the pistons are descending more slowly than under no load, the pressure differences are less marked and parasitic drag in the induction system is negligible. The engine pulls air into the cylinders at the full ambient pressure.

More vacuum is created in some situations. On deceleration or when descending a hill, the throttle will be closed and a low gear selected to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit the speed of the engine. This phenomenon, known as [[engine braking]], is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking should not be confused with [[Compression release engine brake|compression braking]] (aka a "[[Jake brake]]"), or with [[exhaust brake|exhaust braking]], which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.

===Uses of manifold vacuum===
[[File:1929-AEC-Regal-UU6646.jpg|thumb|Autovac fuel lifters. On both buses the red Autovac tank can be seen above and behind the left front wheel.]]
This low (or negative) pressure can be put to uses. A [[pressure gauge]] measuring the manifold pressure can be fitted to give the driver an indication of how hard the engine is working and it can be used to achieve maximum momentary fuel efficiency by adjusting driving habits: minimizing manifold vacuum increases momentary efficiency{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed; source with implementation preferred. Low manifold vacuum may indicate wide open throttle, not high efficiency|date=February 2016}}. A weak manifold vacuum under closed-throttle conditions shows that the butterfly valve or internal components of the engine ([[Poppet valve|valves]] or [[piston ring]]s) are worn, preventing good pumping action by the engine and reducing overall efficiency.

Vacuum is often used to [[Automobile accessory power|drive auxiliary systems]] on the vehicle. [[Vacuum servo|Vacuum-assist brake servos]], for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost [[Idiot proof|foolproof]]. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.

Prior to the introduction of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] in the USA by the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act]] of 1966, it was common to use manifold vacuum to drive [[windscreen wiper]]s with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap &amp; simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle [[HVAC]] systems also used manifold vacuum to drive actuators controlling airflow and temperature.

Another obsolete accessory is the "Autovac" fuel lifter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autovac.co.uk/ autovac.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses vacuum to raise fuel from the main tank to a small auxiliary tank, from which it flows by gravity to the carburetor. This eliminated the fuel pump which, in early cars, was an unreliable item.

===Manifold vacuum in diesel engines===
Many [[diesel engine]]s do not have butterfly valve throttles. The manifold is connected directly to the air intake and the only suction created is that caused by the descending piston with no venturi to increase it, and the engine power is controlled by varying the amount of fuel that is injected into the cylinder by a [[fuel injection]] system. This assists in making diesels much more efficient than petrol engines.

If vacuum is required (vehicles that can be fitted with both petrol and diesel engines often have systems requiring it), a butterfly valve connected to the throttle can be fitted to the manifold. This reduces efficiency and is still not as effective as it is not connected to a venturi. Since low-pressure is only created on the overrun (such as when descending hills with a closed throttle), not over a wide range of situations as in a petrol engine, a vacuum tank is fitted.

Most diesel engines now have a separate vacuum pump ("exhauster") fitted to provide vacuum at all times, at all engine speeds.

Many new [[BMW]] petrol engines do not use a throttle in normal running, but instead use "[[Valvetronic]]" variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the brake servo.

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

The '''Mpemba effect''' is a process in which hot [[water]] can [[freezing|freeze]] faster than cold water. The phenomenon is temperature-dependent. There is disagreement about the parameters required to produce the effect and about its theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep37665| pmid = 27883034| pmc = 5121640| title = Questioning the Mpemba effect: Hot water does not cool more quickly than cold| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 6| pages = 37665| year = 2016| last1 = Burridge| first1 = Henry C.| last2 = Linden| first2 = Paul F.| bibcode = 2016NatSR...637665B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tao"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00735| pmid = 27996255| title = Different Ways of Hydrogen Bonding in Water - Why Does Warm Water Freeze Faster than Cold Water?| journal = Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 55–76| year = 2017| last1 = Tao| first1 = Yunwen| last2 = Zou| first2 = Wenli| last3 = Jia| first3 = Junteng| last4 = Li| first4 = Wei| last5 = Cremer| first5 = Dieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mpemba effect is named after [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Batholomeo Mpemba]] (b.1950) who discovered it in 1963. There were preceding [[ancient]] accounts of similar phenomena, but lacking sufficient detail to attempt verification.

== Definition ==
The phenomenon, when taken to mean "hot water freezes faster than cold", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; Monwhea Jeng proposes as a more precise wording:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.&lt;ref name="Jeng"&gt;{{Cite journal

However, even with this definition it is not clear whether "freezing" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice; the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice; or when the water reaches {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; A quantity of water can be at {{convert|0|C}} and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach {{convert|0|C}} more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at {{convert|0|C}}.

With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed: For example, if the hotter temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases the thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; On the other hand, there may be many circumstances in which the effect is not observed.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt;

=== Historical context ===
Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as [[Aristotle]]: "The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So the inhabitants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html Meteorology] I.12 348b31–349a4&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's explanation involved ''[[antiperistasis]]'', "the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality."

[[Early modern]] scientists such as [[Francis Bacon]] noted that, "slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon, Francis]]; ''Novum Organum''de, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bacon/bacon.liber2.shtml Lib. II], L&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Latin]], "aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam omnino frigida."

[[René Descartes]] wrote in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', "One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated."&lt;ref&gt;[[René Descartes|Descartes, René]]; [http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=423_D44D_1637&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0247 Les Météores]&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to [[Descartes' vortex theory]].

The Scottish scientist [[Joseph Black]] investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Joseph |title=The Supposed Effect of Boiling upon Water, in Disposing It to Freeze More Readily, Ascertained by Experiments. By Joseph Black, M. D. Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh, in a Letter to Sir John Pringle, Bart. P. R. S. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1 January 1775 |volume=65 |pages=124–128 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit's]] description of [[supercooling]] of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.

=== Mpemba's observation ===
The effect is named after [[Tanzania]]n [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]]. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, [[Tanganyika]], when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in [[Iringa]]. The headmaster invited [[Denis Osborne|Dr. Denis G. Osborne]] from the University College in [[Dar es Salaam]] to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] asked him the question, "If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at {{convert|35|C}} and the other at {{convert|100|C}}, and put them into a freezer, the one that started at {{convert|100|C}} freezes first. Why?", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher. After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the [[College of African Wildlife Management]].&lt;ref name="Mpemba"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Modern context ===
Mpemba and Osborne describe placing {{convert|70|ml|abbr=on}} samples of water in {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for ''freezing to start'' was longest with an initial temperature of {{convert|25|C}} and that it was much less at around {{convert|90|C}}. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.&lt;ref name="Mpemba" /&gt;
 
David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically {{convert|-6|to|-18|C}} before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the [[State University of New York]], has said that he believes that supercooling is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chown |first1=Marcus |title=Revealed: why hot water freezes faster than cold |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527535.200-revealed-why-hot-water-freezes-faster-than-cold/ |work=New Scientist |date=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[molecular dynamics]] simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process.&lt;ref name="Jin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers. They say, "We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect".&lt;ref name="Burridge" /&gt;

However, in 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found theoretical evidence of the Mpemba effect and also predicted a new "inverse" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Lu and Raz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lu |first=Zhiyue |last2=Raz |first2=Oren |date=2017-05-16 |title=Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the Markovian Mpemba effect and its inverse |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/20/5083 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=114 |issue=20 |pages=5083–5088 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1701264114 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=28461467 |arxiv=1609.05271 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.5083L |pmc=5441807}}&lt;/ref&gt; yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the [[Ising model]] and diffusion dynamics.

In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] that significantly deviates from the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]].

== Suggested explanations ==
The following explanations have been proposed:

* ''[[Evaporation]]'': The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last= Kell |first=George S.
| title = The freezing of hot and cold water

| doi = 10.1119/1.1975687
| issue = 5
| bibcode = 1969AmJPh..37..564K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation is [[endothermic]], meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Convection]]'': Accelerating [[heat transfer]]s. Reduction of water density below {{convert|4|°C|°F}} tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.&lt;ref&gt;[[CITV]] ''[[Prove It!]]'' [http://www.proveit.tv/series-1/fs.html?p=13&amp;s=3 Series 1 Programme 13]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Frost]]'': Has [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Solution|Solutes]]'': The effects of [[calcium carbonate]], [[magnesium carbonate]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=physics/0604224
| title=When hot water freezes before cold
| journal=American Journal of Physics

| doi=10.1119/1.2996187
| bibcode=2009AmJPh..77...27K
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Thermal conductivity]]'': The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
*''[[Dissolution (chemistry)|Dissolved gases]]'': Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Hydrogen bonding]]'': In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;
* ''[[Crystallization]]'': Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.&lt;ref name="Jin"&gt;{{Cite journal

A reviewer for ''[[Physics World]]'' writes, "Even if the Mpemba effect is real &amp;mdash; if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold &amp;mdash; it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating." He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;Ball, Philip (April 2006). [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2006/mar/29/does-hot-water-freeze-first Does hot water freeze first?]. ''Physics World'', pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' recommends starting the experiment with containers at {{convert|35|and|5|C}} to maximize the effect.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Fossilize Your Hamster: And Other Amazing Experiments for the Armchair Scientist'', {{ISBN|1-84668-044-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] held a competition calling for papers offering explanations to the Mpemba effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/mpemba-competition/ ''Mpemba Competition''], Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 22,000 people entered and [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] himself announced Nikola Bregović as the winner. Bregović suggests two reasons for the effect — a colder sample gets supercooled rather than frozen, and enhanced convection in the warmer sample speeds up cooling by maintaining the heat gradient on the container walls.&lt;ref&gt;Bregović, Nikola; [http://www.rsc.org/images/nikola-bregovic-entry_tcm18-225169.pdf ''Mpemba effect from a viewpoint of an experimental physical chemist''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation in 2016. On the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modeling with [[density functional theory]]-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different [[hydrogen bond]]s. Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as [[temperature]] is elevated.  The existence of the small strongly-bonded clusters facilitates in turn the [[nucleation]] of [[Ice Ih|hexagonal ice]] when warm water is rapidly cooled down.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;

== Similar effects ==
Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are
* [[Latent heat]]: turning {{convert|0|C}} ice to {{convert|0|C}} water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from {{convert|0|C}} to {{convert|80|C}} 
* [[Leidenfrost effect]]: lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers

The '''natural environment''' encompasses all [[life|living]] and non-living things occurring [[nature|naturally]], meaning in this case not [[Artificiality|artificial]]. The term is most often applied to the [[Earth]] or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [[species]], [[climate]], weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.

The concept of the ''natural environment'' can be distinguished as components:
* Complete [[ecological units]] that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [[microorganism]]s, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries and their nature. 
* Universal [[natural resource]]s and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from civilized human actions

In contrast to the natural environment is the [[built environment]]. In such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment.

People seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from  100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other.

Earth science generally recognizes 4 spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]]&lt;ref name="wheeling"&gt;
[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html     Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=2007-08-31 }}. ©1997-2000.

Some scientists include, as part of the spheres of the Earth, the [[cryosphere]] (corresponding to [[ice]]) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the [[pedosphere]] (corresponding to [[soil]]) as an active and intermixed sphere. [[Earth science]] (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four major [[discipline]]s in earth sciences, namely [[geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]] and [[geodesy]]. These major disciplines use [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or ''[[Outline of Earth sciences#Earth's spheres|spheres]]'' of Earth.

==Geological activity==
{{Main|Geology}}
The Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]]  cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.

==Water on Earth==
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright=0.55|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Coral reef]]s have significant marine [[biodiversity]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most water is found in one or another natural kind of [[body of water]].

=== Oceans ===
{{Main|Ocean}}
An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233027/http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]].

=== Rivers ===
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], a [[sea]] or another river.  A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water. 
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky stream in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]]]

The water in a river is usually in a [[channel (geography)|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook.  Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.  Streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113503/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lácar Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuquén|Argentina}}.]]

{{Main|Lake}}

A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]].  A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=2008-06-25
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Dictionary.com definition

|quote=a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
{{clear}}

==== Ponds ====
{{Main|Pond}}
A pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=203 - 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for humans, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.&lt;ref name=Goudie/&gt;

== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the Atmosphere===
{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}

====Principal layers====
Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.
* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties.
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]].

====Effects of global warming====
[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The Retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]].]]
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}

The potential dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly.–This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]]. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:

[[File:Aletschgletsjer Zwitserland.JPG|right|thumb|Another view of the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] and because of [[global warming]] it has been decreasing]]
* The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention Treaty]] and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html Kyoto Protocol] from [http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Climate Initiative]], to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative], Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate

Surface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

==Life==
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;There are many [[plant species]] on the planet.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;An example of the many [[animal species]] on the [[Earth]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Evidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]". University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s. In [[biology]], the science of living organisms, "life" is the condition which distinguishes active [[organism]]s from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic matter]], including the capacity for growth, [[Physiology|functional activity]] and the continual change preceding death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary. English Edition 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |access-date=2009-06-21 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the [[biosphere]] on [[Earth]], and properties common to these organisms—[[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]—are a [[Carbon-based life|carbon]]- and [[Water and life|water]]-based [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] form with complex [[organization]] and heritable [[gene]]tic information. Living organisms undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[Cell growth|grow]], respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduce]] and, through [[natural selection]], adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

==Ecosystems==
[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|left|[[Rainforest]]s often have a great deal of [[biodiversity]] with many plant and animal species. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]
{{Main|Ecosystem}}

An [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]] The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].

A greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

==Biomes==
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to ''as'' ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

==Biogeochemical cycles==
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|[[Chloroplasts]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'' — Many-fruited Thyme-moss.]]
{{Main|Biogeochemical cycles}}

Global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V. (2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

==Wilderness==

{{Main|Wilderness}}

[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

{{See also|List of environmental issues}}
It is the common understanding of ''natural environment'' that underlies [[environmentalism]] — a broad [[politics|political]], [[sociology|social]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, ''wild'' nature (e.g., unmanaged [[forests]], uncultivated [[grasslands]], [[wildlife]], [[wildflower]]s) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [[environmental scientist]]s and [[environmentalist]]s include:

* Elimination of [[pollution]] and [[toxicant]]s in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of [[biodiversity]] and protection of [[endangered species]].
* [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of resources such as [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Escolero, O. |author2=Kralisch, S. |author3=Martínez, S.E. |author4=Perevochtchikova, M.|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced [[global warming]], which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from [[fossil fuels]] to [[renewable energy]] in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability.  This may include [[public transportation]] and [[distributed generation]], which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Establishment of [[nature reserve]]s for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting [[waste management]] including [[waste reduction]] (or even [[zero waste]]), [[reuse]], [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] of sewage sludge.

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dale. (2007).

Compared to composites reinforced with [[glass fiber]]s, composites with natural fibers have advantages such as lower density, better thermal insulation, and reduced skin irritation. Further, unlike glass fibers, natural fibers can be broken down by bacteria once they are no longer in use.

Natural fibers are good sweat absorbents and can be found in a variety of textures. Cotton fibers made from the cotton plant, for example, produce fabrics that are light in weight, soft in texture, and which can be made in various sizes and colors. Clothes made of natural fibers such as cotton are often preferred over clothing made of [[synthetic fiber]]s by people living in hot and humid climates.

==General Information==
Natural fibers are made from [[Fiber crop|plant]], [[Animal fiber|animal]], and [[Mineral fiber|mineral]] sources. Natural fibers can be classified according to their origin.

=== Animal fibers ===
[[Animal fiber]]s generally comprise [[protein]]s such as [[collagen]], [[keratin]] and [[fibroin]]; examples include [[silk]], [[sinew]], [[wool]], [[catgut]], [[angora wool|angora]], [[mohair]] and [[alpaca#Fiber|alpaca]].

* Animal hair (wool or hairs): Fiber or [[wool]] taken from animals or hairy mammals. e.g. sheep's wool, goat hair ([[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], [[mohair]]), [[alpaca wool|alpaca hair]], horse hair, etc.
* Silk fiber: Fiber secreted by glands (often located near the mouth) of insects during the preparation of [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s.
* Avian fiber: Fibers from birds, e.g. [[feather]]s and feather fiber.

=== Chitin ===
{{Main|Chitin}}[[File:Chitin.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of chitin chains]]
Chitin is the second most abundant natural polymer in the world, with collagen being the first. It is a “linear polysaccharide of β-(1-4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Chitin is highly crystalline and is usually composed of chains organized in a β sheet. Due to its high crystallinity and chemical structure, it is insoluble in many solvents. It also has a low toxicity in the body and is inert in the intestines. Chitin also has antibacterial properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinaudo|first=Marguerite|date=2006-07-01|title=Chitin and chitosan: Properties and applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079670006000530|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|volume=31|issue=7|pages=603–632|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitin forms crystals that make fibrils that become surrounded by proteins. These fibrils can bundle to make larger fibers that contribute to the hierarchical structure of many biological materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Marc André|last2=Chen|first2=Po-Yu|last3=Lin|first3=Albert Yu-Min|last4=Seki|first4=Yasuaki|date=2008-01-01|title=Biological materials: Structure and mechanical properties|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642507000254|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–206|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fibrils can form randomly oriented networks that provide the mechanical strength of the organic layer in different biological materials.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Marc A.|last2=Chen|first2=Po-Yu|last3=Lopez|first3=Maria I.|last4=Seki|first4=Yasuaki|last5=Lin|first5=Albert Y. M.|date=2011-07-01|title=Biological materials: A materials science approach|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751616110001128|journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials|series=Special Issue on Natural Materials / Papers from the Third International Conference on the Mechanics of Biomaterials and Tissues|volume=4|issue=5|pages=626–657|doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitin provides protection and structural support to many living organisms. It makes up the cell walls of fungi and yeast, the shells of mollusks, the [[exoskeleton]]s of insects and [[arthropod]]s. In shells and exoskeletons, the chitin fibers contribute to their hierarchical structure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Materials Science|last=Meyers|first=M.A.|last2=Chen|first2=P.Y.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2014|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, pure chitin (100% [[acetylation]]) does not exist. It instead exists as a [[copolymer]] with chitin's deacetylated derivative, chitosan. When the acetylized composition of the copolymer is over 50% acetylated it is chitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This copolymer of chitin and chitosan is a random or block copolymer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chitosan ===
{{Main|Chitosan}}[[File:Chitosan_chemical_structural_formula.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of chitosan chain]]
Chitosan is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. When the acetylized composition of the copolymer is below 50% it is chitosan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chitosan is a semicrystalline “polymer of β-(1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  One difference between chitin and chitosan is that chitosan is soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. Chitosan is easier to process that chitin, but it is less stable because it is more hydrophilic and has pH sensitivity. Due to its ease of processing, chitosan is used in biomedical applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collagen ===
{{Main|Collagen}}Collagen is a structural protein, often referred to as “the steel of biological materials”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968439866|title=BIOMECHANICS : mechanical properties of living tissues (1).|last=C.|first=FUNG, Y.|date=1981-01-01|publisher=SPRINGER|isbn=1475717520|oclc=968439866}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple types of collagen: [[Type I collagen|Type I]] (comprising skin, tendons and ligaments, vasculature and organs, as well as teeth and bone); [[Type II collagen|Type II]] (a component in cartilage); Type III (often found in [[reticular fiber]]s); and others. Collagen has a hierarchical structure, forming triple helices, [[fibril]]s, and fibers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Keratin ===
{{Main|Keratin}}
[[File:Alpha Keratin Basic Structure.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the creation of alpha keratins helical structure.]]
Keratin is a structural protein located at the hard surfaces in many vertebrates. Keratin has two forms, [[α-keratin]] and [[β-keratin]] and are used by different classes of animals. The naming convention for proteins follows that for keratin, alpha keratin is helical and beta keratin is sheet like. Alpha keratin is found in mammalian hair, skin, nails, horn and quills, while beta keratin can be found in avian and reptilian species in scales, feathers, and beaks. The two different structures of keratin have dissimilar mechanical properties, as seen in their dissimilar applications. The relative alignment of the keratin fibrils has a significant impact on the mechanical properties. In human hair the filaments of alpha keratin are highly aligned, giving a tensile strength of approximately 200MPa. This tensile strength is an order of magnitude higher than human nails (20MPa), because human hair’s keratin filaments are more aligned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Properties ==
Compared to synthetic fibers, natural fibers tend have decreased stiffness and strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Properties also decrease with the age of the fiber. Younger fibers tend to be stronger and more elastic than older ones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many natural fibers exhibit strain rate sensitivity due to their viscoelastic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fratzl|first=Peter|last2=Weinkamer|first2=Richard|date=2007-11-01|title=Nature’s hierarchical materials|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007964250700045X|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1263–1334|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone contains collagen and exhibits strain rate sensitivity in that the stiffness increases with strain rate, also known as [[Work hardening|strain hardening]]. Spider silk has hard and elastic regions that together contribute to its strain rate sensitivity, these cause the silk to exhibit strain hardening as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Properties of natural fibers are also dependent on the moisture content in the fiber.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Moisture Dependence ===
The presence of water plays a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of natural fibers. Hydrated, biopolymers generally have enhanced ductility and toughness. Water plays the role of a [[plasticizer]], a small molecule easing passage of polymer chains and in doing so increasing ductility and toughness. When using natural fibers in applications outside of their native use, the original level of hydration must be taken into account. For example when hydrated, the Young’s Modulus of collagen decreases from 3.26 to 0.6 GPa and becomes both more ductile and tougher. Additionally the density of collagen decreases from 1.34 to 1.18 g/cm^3.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:19th century knowledge weaving flax hemp jute manila sisal vegetable fibers.jpg|thumb|19th century knowledge weaving [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[Manila hemp]], [[sisal]] and vegetable fibers]]

=== Industrial Use ===
Of industrial value are four animal fibers, wool, silk, camel hair, and angora as well as four plant fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute.  Dominant in terms of scale of production and use is cotton for textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Fibers, 1. Survey|encyclopedia=ULLMANN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY|authors=Erik Frank, Volker Bauch, Fritz Schultze-Gebhardt and Karl-Heinz Herlinger|year=2011|doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_451.pub2|publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural fiber composites ===
{{Main|Biocomposite}}
Natural fibers are also used in composite materials, much like synthetic or glass fibers. These composites, called biocomposites, are a natural fiber in a matrix of synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One of the first biofiber-reinforced plastics in use was a cellulose fiber in phenolics in 1908.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Usage includes applications where energy absorption is important, such as insulation, noise absorbing panels, or collapsable areas in automobiles.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heng|first=Jerry Y. Y.|last2=Pearse|first2=Duncan F.|last3=Thielmann|first3=Frank|last4=Lampke|first4=Thomas|last5=Bismarck|first5=Alexander|date=2007-01-01|title=Methods to determine surface energies of natural fibres: a review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156855407782106492|journal=Composite Interfaces|volume=14|issue=7-9|pages=581–604|doi=10.1163/156855407782106492|issn=0927-6440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural fibers can have different advantages over synthetic reinforcing fibers. Most notably they are biodegradable and renewable. Additionally, they often have low densities and lower processing costs than synthetic materials.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajesh|first=Murugan|last2=Pitchaimani|first2=Jeyaraj|title=Mechanical Properties of Natural Fiber Braided Yarn Woven Composite: Comparison with Conventional Yarn Woven Composite|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1672652916603852|journal=Journal of Bionic Engineering|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=141–150|doi=10.1016/s1672-6529(16)60385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design issues with natural fiber-reinforced composites include poor strength (natural fibers are not as strong as glass fibers) and difficulty with actually bonding the fibers and the matrix. Hydrophobic polymer matrices offer insufficient adhesion for hydrophilic fibers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Nanocomposites ===
{{Main|Nanocomposite}}Nanocomposites are desirable for their mechanical properties. When fillers in a composite are at the [[Nanometre|nanometer]] length scale, the surface to volume ratio of the filler material is high, which influences the bulk properties of the composite more compared to traditional composites. The properties of these nanosized elements is markedly different than that of its bulk constituent.

In regards to natural fibers, some of the best example of nanocomposites appear in biology. [[Bone]], [[Abalone|abalone shell]], [[nacre]], and tooth [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] are all nanocomposites. As of 2010, most synthetic polymer nanocomposites exhibit inferior toughness and mechanical properties compared to biological nanocomposites.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|title=Mechanical Principles of Biological Nanocomposites|last=Ji|first=Baohua|last2=Gao|first2=Huajian|date=2010-07-02|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|access-date=2017-05-08|bibcode=2010AnRMS..40...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completely synthetic nanocomposites do exist, however nanosized biopolymers are also being tested in synthetic matrices. Several types of protein based, nanosized fibers are being used in nanocomposites. These include collagen, cellulose, chitin and tunican.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These structural proteins must be processed before use in composites.

To use cellulose as an example, [[semicrystalline]] microfibrils are sheared in the amorphous region, resulting in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils are at this points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical. Whiskers of collagen, chitin, and cellulose have all be used to make biological nanocomposites. The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of [[polystyrene]] and polyacrylate.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Traditionally in composite science a strong interface between the matrix and filler is required to achieve favorable mechanical properties. If this is not the case, the phases tend to separate along the weak interface and makes for very poor mechanical properties. In a MCC composite however this is not the case, if the interaction between the filler and matrix is stronger than the filler-filler interaction the mechanical strength of the composite is noticeably decreased.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Alloin|first2=Fannie|last3=Dufresne|first3=Alain|date=March 2005|title=Review of Recent Research into Cellulosic Whiskers, Their Properties and Their Application in Nanocomposite Field|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=6|issue=2|pages=612–626|doi=10.1021/bm0493685|last1=Azizi Samir|first1=My Ahmed Said}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties in natural fiber nanocomposites arise from dispersity and the tendency small fibers to aggregate in the matrix. Because of the high surface area to volume ratio the fibers have a tendency to aggregate, more so than in micro-scale composites. Additionally secondary processing of collagen sources to obtain sufficient purity collagen micro fibrils adds a degree of cost and challenge to creating a load bearing cellulose or other filler based nanocomposite.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Biomaterial/Biocompatibility ===
{{Main|Biomaterial}}Natural fibers often show promise as biomaterials in medical applications. Chitin is notable in particular and has been incorporated into a variety of uses. Chitin based materials have also been used to remove industrial pollutants from water, processed into fibers and films, and used as [[biosensor]]s in the food industry.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=A|last2=Misra|first2=M|last3=Henrichsen|first3=G|date=March 2000|title=Biofibres, biodegradable polymers and biocomposites:An overview|url=|journal=Macromolecular Materials and Engineering|volume=276|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitin has also been used several of medical applications. It has been incorporated as a bone filling material for tissue regeneration, a drug carrier and [[excipient]], and as an antitumor agent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biomaterials: The Intersection of Biology and Materials Science|last=Temenoff|first=J.|last2=Mikos|first2=A|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insertion of foreign materials into the body often triggers an immune response, which can have a variety of positive or negative outcomes depending on the bodies response to the material. Implanting something made from naturally synthesized proteins, such as a keratin based implant, has the potential to be recognized as natural tissue by the body. This can lead either to integration in rare cases where the structure of the implant promotes regrowth of tissue with the implant forming a superstructure or degradation of the implant in which the backbones of the proteins are recognized for cleavage by the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36335">{{About|the term that is used in philosophy||Naturalism (disambiguation)}}

In [[philosophy]], '''naturalism''' is the "idea or belief that only [[Physical law|natural]] (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125337?redirectedFrom=naturalism naturalism]&lt;/ref&gt;  Adherents of naturalism (''i.e.'', naturalists) assert that natural laws are the rules that govern the structure and behavior of the natural universe, that the changing [[universe]] at every stage is a product of these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10713a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Naturalism|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=6 March 2012|quote=Naturalism is not so much a special system as a point of view or tendency common to a number of philosophical and religious systems; not so much a well-defined set of positive and negative doctrines as an attitude or spirit pervading and influencing many doctrines. As the name implies, this tendency consists essentially in looking upon nature as the one original and fundamental source of all that exists, and in attempting to explain everything in terms of nature. Either the limits of nature are also the limits of existing reality, or at least the first cause, [[cosmological argument|if its existence is found necessary]], has nothing to do with the working of natural agencies. All events, therefore, find their adequate explanation within nature itself. But, as the terms nature and natural are themselves used in more than one sense, the term naturalism is also far from having one fixed meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Naturalism can intuitively be separated into an [[ontological]] and a [[methodological]] component," argues David Papineau.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/|title=Naturalism|last=Papineau|first=David|authorlink=David Papineau|date=22 February 2007|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ontological" refers to the philosophical study of the nature of reality. Some philosophers equate naturalism with [[materialism]]. For example, philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] argues that nature is best accounted for by reference to [[Matter|material]] principles. These principles include [[mass]], [[energy]], and other [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] accepted by the [[scientific community]]. Further, this sense of naturalism holds that [[Spirit|spirits]], [[Deity|deities]], and [[Ghost|ghosts]] are not real and that there is no "[[Teleology|purpose]]" in nature. Such an absolute belief in naturalism is commonly referred to as ''[[metaphysical naturalism]]''.&lt;ref name="KurtzDistinction"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kurtz, Paul|authorlink=Paul Kurtz|date=Spring 1998|title=Darwin Re-Crucified: Why Are So Many Afraid of Naturalism?|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/kurtz_18_2.html|journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming naturalism in working methods as the current paradigm, without the further consideration of naturalism as an absolute truth with philosophical entailment, is called ''[[methodological naturalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html|title=Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science|last=Schafersman|first=Steven D.|authorlink=Steven Schafersman|year=1996|quote=Methodological naturalism is the adoption or assumption of naturalism in scientific belief and practice without really believing in naturalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject matter here is a philosophy of acquiring knowledge based on an assumed paradigm.

With the exception of [[Pantheism|pantheists]]—who believe that Nature is identical with divinity while not recognizing a distinct personal anthropomorphic god—[[Theism|theists]] challenge the idea that nature contains all of reality. According to some theists, natural laws may be viewed as so-called [[Secondary causation|secondary causes]] of God(s).

In the 20th century, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[George Santayana]], and other philosophers argued that the success of naturalism in science meant that scientific methods should also be used in philosophy. Science and philosophy are said to form a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], according to this view.

== Origins and history ==
{{main|History of metaphysical naturalism}}
The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011). URL:http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511570797&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The term "[[methodological naturalism]]" is much more recent though. According to [[Ronald Numbers]], it was coined in 1983 by Paul de Vries, a [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton College]] philosopher. De Vries distinguished between what he called "methodological naturalism," a disciplinary method that says nothing about God's existence, and "metaphysical naturalism," which "denies the existence of a transcendent God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Matzke]]: [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/03/on_the_origins.html On the Origins of Methodological Naturalism]. ''The Pandas Thumb'' (March 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "methodological naturalism" had been used in 1937 by [[Edgar S. Brightman]] in an article in ''The Philosophical Review'' as a contrast to "naturalism" in general, but there the idea was not really developed to its more recent distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/archive/asa/200603/0501.html|title=ASA March 2006 – Re: Methodological Naturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; 
# Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]];  
# Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; 
# Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy;
# The [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  Naturalism is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Or, as [[Carl Sagan]] succinctly put it: "''The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition [[Arthur C. Danto]] states that Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions needed for science from naturalism==

According to [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p98831/pdf/ch0615.pdf|title=Chapter 6, The Privileged Status of Science |first=Lee|last=Boldman|year=2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alfred North Whitehead]] wrote, "All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.  These assumptions are justified partly by their adherence to the types of occurrence of which we are directly conscious, and partly by their success in representing the observed facts with a certain generality, devoid of ''ad hoc'' suppositions."{{sfn|Whitehead|1997|p=135}}  Priddy notes that all scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://robertpriddy.com/lim/5.html |chapter=Chapter Five, Scientific Objectivity in Question  |title=Science Limited |first=Robert |last=Priddy  |year=1998|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For naturalists, nature is the only reality.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality, including the human spirit: "The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily... reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalism is the implicit philosophy of working scientists, that the following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method:{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed."&lt;ref&gt;

== Metaphysical naturalism ==
{{Main|Metaphysical naturalism}}
Metaphysical naturalism, also called "ontological naturalism" and "philosophical naturalism", is a philosophical worldview and belief system that holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]], i.e., those required to understand our physical environment by [[mathematical modeling]].  Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers exclusively to the methodology of science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Metaphysical naturalism holds that all properties related to [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] are reducible to, or [[supervene]] upon, nature. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or spiritual naturalism.  More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Methodological naturalism&lt;!--'Methodological naturalism' redirects here--&gt; ==
{{further|Alternatives to natural selection}}

'''Methodological naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; concerns itself with methods of learning what nature is. These methods are useful in the evaluation of claims about existence and knowledge  and in identifying causal mechanisms responsible for the emergence of physical phenomena.  It attempts to explain and test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second sense of the term "naturalism" seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature.  Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge. It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a [[epistemology|philosophy of knowledge]]. Studies by sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund|Elaine Ecklund]] suggest that religious scientists in practice apply methodological naturalism. They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications - often moral - of their work, but not the way they practice science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think|first=Elaine Howard|last=Ecklund|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195392982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles and books from 1996 onward, [[Robert T. Pennock]] wrote using the term "methodological naturalism" to clarify that the [[scientific method]] confines itself to natural explanations without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and is not based on dogmatic [[metaphysical naturalism]] (as claimed by [[creationism|creationists]] and proponents of [[intelligent design]], in particular by [[Phillip E. Johnson]]). Pennock's testimony as an expert witness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day3am2.html|title=Kitzmiller v. Dover: Day 3, AM: Robert Pennock (continued)|website=www.talkorigins.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial was cited by the Judge in his ''Memorandum Opinion'' concluding that "Methodological naturalism is a 'ground rule' of science today":&lt;ref name=kitz&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#4. Whether ID is Science | Kitzmiller v. Dover: Whether ID is Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science." Methodological naturalism is thus "a paradigm of science." It is a "ground rule" that "requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify.&lt;ref&gt;
Judge John E. Jones, III [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision2.html Decision of the Court] Expert witnesses were [[John F. Haught]], [[Robert T. Pennock]], and [[Kenneth R. Miller]].  Links in the original to specific testimony records have been deleted here.

=== Alvin Plantinga ===
[[Alvin Plantinga]], Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and a [[Christian]], has become a well-known critic of naturalism.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002p9"&gt;{{cite book |first= J.K. |last= Beilby |year= 2002 |title= Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series= G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |publisher= Cornell University Press |isbn= 9780801487637 |lccn= 2001006111 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PR9 |page= ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}  He suggests, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism |reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless the evolution of humans was guided (for example, by God).  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title= Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Alvin |last= Plantinga |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title= Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher= The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= 11 April 2010 |quote= ...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe.

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[Evil demon]] or [[Brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;

=== Robert T. Pennock ===
[[Robert T. Pennock]] contends&lt;ref name=lettuce&gt;[[Robert T. Pennock]], [http://www.msu.edu/~pennock5/research/papers/Pennock_SupNatExpl.html Supernaturalist Explanations and the Prospects for a Theistic Science or "How do you know it was the lettuce?"]&lt;/ref&gt; that as [[supernatural]] agents and powers "are above and beyond the natural world and its agents and powers" and "are not constrained by natural laws", only logical impossibilities constrain what a supernatural agent could not do. He states: "If we could apply natural knowledge to understand supernatural powers, then, by definition, they would not be supernatural". As the supernatural is necessarily a mystery to us, it can provide no grounds on which to judge scientific models. "Experimentation requires observation and control of the variables.... But by definition we have no control over supernatural entities or forces." Science does not deal with meanings; the closed system of scientific reasoning cannot be used to define itself. Allowing science to appeal to untestable supernatural powers would make the scientist's task meaningless, undermine the discipline that allows science to make progress, and "would be as profoundly unsatisfying as the ancient Greek playwright's reliance upon the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to extract his hero from a difficult predicament."

Naturalism of this sort says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, anything that can be scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.

=== W. V. O. Quine ===
{{main|Naturalized epistemology}}
[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] describes naturalism as the position that there is no higher tribunal for truth than natural science itself. In his view, there is no better method than the scientific method for judging the claims of science, and there is neither any need nor any place for a "first philosophy", such as (abstract) [[metaphysics]] or [[epistemology]], that could stand behind and justify science or the scientific method.

Therefore, philosophy should feel free to make use of the findings of scientists in its own pursuit, while also feeling free to offer criticism when those claims are ungrounded, confused, or inconsistent. In Quine's view, philosophy is "continuous with" science and ''both'' are empirical.&lt;ref name=Rudder&gt;{{cite book |title=Naturalism and the First-Person Perspective |author=Lynne Rudder |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9G_bIWzgjFkC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |isbn=0199914745 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism is not a dogmatic belief that the modern view of science is entirely correct. Instead, it simply holds that science is the best way to explore the processes of the universe and that those processes are what modern science is striving to understand.  However, this Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters among philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Feldman |first= Richard |editor-first= Edward N.

=== Karl Popper ===
[[Karl Popper]] equated naturalism with [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] theory of science. He rejected it based on his general critique of induction (see [[problem of induction]]), yet acknowledged its utility as means for inventing conjectures.
{{quotation|A naturalistic methodology (sometimes called an "inductive theory of science") has its value, no doubt....  I reject the naturalistic view: It is uncritical. Its upholders fail to notice that whenever they believe to have discovered a fact, they have only proposed a convention. Hence the convention is liable to turn into a dogma. This criticism of the naturalistic view applies not only to its criterion of meaning, but also to its idea of science, and consequently to its idea of empirical method.|Karl R. Popper|''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''|(Routledge, 2002), pp. 52–53, {{ISBN|0-415-27844-9}}.}}
Popper instead proposed that science should adopt a methodology based on [[falsifiability]] for [[demarcation problem|demarcation]], because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a single experiment can contradict one.  Popper holds that scientific theories are characterized by falsifiability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Naturhistorieselskabet''' - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in [[natural history]] in [[Denmark]] in the late 18th century. The spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and an escalating [[agriculture|agricultural]] crisis, led the [[List of Danish monarchs|king]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] elite to call foreign experts on [[economy]], including [[botany]] and [[silviculture]], to the country. The autonomous [[University of Copenhagen]], on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] based on private funds. For example, [[Martin Vahl]] lectured in [[botany]]. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in [[geology]] and in 1797 one in [[botany]], the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|Water covers about 71% of Earth's surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

Large-enough [[planetesimal]]s were heated by the decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water in the development of Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Planetary differentiation}}
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. As cooling continued, [[subduction]] and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=N.

The [[Cool early Earth]] theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

'''Orthodox Marxism''' is the body of [[Marxist]] thought that emerged after the death of [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and which became the official philosophy of the [[Socialism|socialist movement]] as represented in the [[Second International]] until the First World War in 1914. Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of [[classical Marxism]].

The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn= 978-0415198776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the term orthodox Marxism, the word "orthodox" refers to the methods of [[historical materialism]] and of [[dialectical materialism]]—and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, Georg. ''What is Orthodox Marxism?''. Marxism Internet Archive (1919): [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm "What is Orthodox Marxism?"]. "Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the 'belief' in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a 'sacred' book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The emergence of orthodox Marxism is associated with the latter works of [[Friedrich Engels]], such as the ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' and ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'', which were efforts to popularise the work of Karl Marx, render it systematic and apply it to the fundamental questions of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Mendelson. "On Engels' metaphysical dialectics: A foundation of orthodox "Marxism"" ''Dialectical Anthropology''. 1979. Volume 4. Issue 1. pp. 65–73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel De Leon]], an early American socialist leader, contributed much to the thought during the final years of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Orthodox Marxism was further developed during the Second International by thinkers such as [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Karl Kautsky]]. Kautsky and to a lesser extent Plekhanov were in turn major influences on [[Vladimir Lenin]], whose version of Marxism was known as [[Leninism]] by its contemporaries. The official thought of the [[Third International]] was based in orthodox Marxism combined with Leninist views on revolutionary organization.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The terms [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] are associated with this phase of orthodox Marxism. [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Hal Draper]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] are prominent thinkers in the orthodox Marxist tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with later variations of Marxism, notably [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] and [[Leninism]]. In contrast to Lenin's Bolshevik idea of revolution, orthodox Marxists said that Imperial Russia was too backwards for the development of socialism and would first have undergo a capitalist (bourgeois) phase of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David Ramsay|title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation|publisher=Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page=67|quote=Lenin is urging a socialist revolution in Russia, against the traditional Marxists who argue that Russia is too backwards for anything but a bourgeois revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of orthodox Marxism are:
* A strong version of the theory that the economic base (material conditions) determines the cultural and political [[Superstructure#Marxist concept|superstructure]] of society. In its most extensive form, this view is called [[economic determinism]], [[economism]] and vulgar materialism. A related variation is that of [[technological determinism]].
* The view that capitalism cannot be reformed through policy and that any attempt to do so would only exacerbate its contradictions or distort the efficiency of the market economy (in contrast to [[reformism]]). Orthodox Marxism holds that the only viable and lasting solution to the contradictions of capitalism is for the establishment of a post-capitalist [[socialist economy]].
* The centrality of class as a process and the view that existing policymakers and government is largely and structurally beholden to the interests of the [[ruling class]]. This view is called [[instrumental Marxism]].
* The claim that Marxist methodology is a science.
* The attempt to make Marxism a total system, adapting it to changes within the realm of current events and knowledge.
* An understanding of [[ideology]] in terms of [[false consciousness]].
* That every open class struggle is a political struggle.
* A pre-crisis emphasis on organizing an independent, mass workers' movement (in the form of welfare, recreational, educational and cultural organizations) and especially its political party, combining reform struggles and mass strikes without overreliance on either. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* The socialist revolution is necessarily the act of the majority (contrasted with [[Marxism–Leninism]]'s view of the [[vanguard party]] and [[democratic centralism]]).

Orthodox Marxism is contrasted with [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist Marxism]] as developed in post-First World War [[Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic parties]]. Some writers also contrast it with Marxism–Leninism as it developed in the Soviet Union,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} while others describe the latter as firmly within orthodoxy: &lt;blockquote&gt;Orthodox Marxism rested on and grew out of the European working class movement that emerged in the final quarter of the 19th century and continued in that form until the middle years of the twentieth century. Its two institutional expressions were the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, which despite the great schism in 1919, were marked by a shared conception of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Wage labour|labour]]. Their fortunes therefore rose and fell together. [[Trotskyism]] and [[Left communism]] were equally orthodox in their thinking and approach, and therefore must be considered left-variants of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Rooke. [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext30/Rooke.html "Marxism is Dead! Long Live Marxism!"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}}

Two variants of orthodox Marxism are [[impossibilism]] and [[anti-revisionism]]. Impossibilism is a form of orthodox Marxism that both rejects the [[reformism]] of revisionist Marxism and opposes the Leninist theories of imperialism, vanguardism and democratic centralism (which argue that socialism can be constructed in underdeveloped, [[Feudalism|quasi-feudal]] countries through revolutionary action as opposed to being an emergent result of advances in material development). An extreme form of this position is held by the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, M.C. and King, J.E. ''State Capitalism in the Soviet Union''. History of Economic Thought Society of Australia: http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf: "The same point was made, in the United Kingdom, by the leadership of the remorselessly orthodox Socialist Party of Great Britain".&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anti-revisionist tradition criticised official [[Communist party|Communist parties]] from the opposite perspective as having abandoned the orthodox Marxism of the founding fathers.

== Variants ==
A number of theoretical perspectives and political movements emerged that were firmly rooted in orthodox Marxist analysis, as contrasted with later interpretations and alternative developments in Marxist theory and practice such as Marxism–Leninism, revisionism and reformism.

=== Impossibilism ===
{{main|Impossibilism}}
Impossibilism stresses the limited value of economic, social, cultural and political reforms under capitalism and posits that socialists and Marxists should solely focus on efforts to propagate and establish socialism, disregarding any other cause that has no connection to the goal of the realization of socialism.

Impossibilism posits that reforms to capitalism are counterproductive because they strengthen support for capitalism by the working class by making its conditions more tolerable while creating further contradictions of their own, while removing the socialist character of the parties championing and implementing said reforms. Because reforms cannot solve the systemic contradictions of capitalism, impossibilism opposes reformism, revisionism and ethical socialism.

Impossibilism also opposes the idea of a vanguard-led revolution and the centralization of political power in any elite group of people as espoused by Leninism and Marxism–Leninism .

This perspective is maintained by the [[World Socialist Movement]], [[De Leonism]], and to some extent followers of [[Karl Kautsky]] and pre-reformist social democracy.

=== Luxemburgism ===
Luxemburgism is an informal designation for a current of Marxist thought and practice that originates from the ideas and work of [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. In particular, it stresses the importance for spontaneous revolution which can only emerge in response to mounting contradictions between the productive forces and social relations of society and therefore rejects Leninism and Bolshevism for its insistence on a "hands-on" approach to revolution. Luxemburgism is also highly critical of the reformist Marxism that emerged from the work of Eduard Bernstein's faction of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism "[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm|title=Do We Support Reformist Demands?|author=Duncan Hallas|year=1973|work=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands?|publisher=International Socialism|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menshevism ===
Menshevism refers to the political positions taken by the [[Menshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] prior to the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. The Mensheviks believed that socialism could not be realized in Russia due to its backwards economic conditions and that Russia would first have to experience a bourgeois revolution and go through a capitalist stage of development before socialism became technically possible and before the working class could develop the class consciousness for a [[Proletarian revolution|socialist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/m/e.htm|title=Menshevik|work=Marxism.org|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mensheviks were thus opposed to the Bolshevik idea of a [[vanguard party]] and their pursuit of socialist revolution in semi-feudal Russia.

=== Karl Kautsky and "Kautskyism" ===
[[Karl Kautsky]] is recognized as one of the most authoritative promulgators of orthodox Marxism following the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895. As an advisor to [[August Bebel]], leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) until Bebel's death in 1913 and as editor of Die Neue Zeit from 1883 till 1917, he was known as the "Pope of Marxism". He was removed as editor by the leadership of the SPD when the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) split away from the SPD. Kautsky was an outspoken critic of Bolshevism and Leninism, seeing the Bolsheviks (or Communists as they had renamed themselves after 1917) as an organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Kautsky was also opposed to Eduard Bernstein's reformist politics in the period 1896–1901.

=== Instrumental Marxism ===
Instrumental Marxism is a theory derived from classical Marxism which reasons that policy makers in government and positions of power tend to "share a common business or class background, and that their decisions will reflect their business or class interests".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. 2004. ''International Relations''. Canadian Edition. Ed. Whitworth, Sandra. Toronto: [[Pearson Education]]. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There have been a number of criticisms of orthodox Marxism from within the socialist movement. From the 1890s during the Second International, [[Eduard Bernstein]] and others developed a position known as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]], which sought to revise Marx's views based on the idea that the progressive development of capitalism and the extension of democracy meant that gradual, parliamentary reform could achieve socialism. This view was contested by orthodox Marxists such as Kautsky as well as by the young [[Georg Lukacs]], who in 1919 clarified the definition of orthodox Marxism as thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;[O]rthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its founders. It is the conviction, moreover, that all attempts to surpass or 'improve' it have led and must lead to over-simplification, triviality and eclecticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm "What is Orthodox Marxism?"]. March 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Western Marxism]], the intellectual Marxism which developed in Western Europe from the 1920s onwards, sought to make Marxism more "sophisticated", open and flexible by examining issues like culture that were outside the field of orthodox Marxism. Western Marxists, such as [[Georg Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], have tended to be open to influences orthodox Marxists consider [[bourgeois]], such as [[psychoanalysis]] and the [[sociology]] of [[Max Weber]]. Marco Torres illustrates the shift away from orthodox Marxism in the Frankfurt School: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1920s, the original members of the Frankfurt Institute—half forgotten names such as [[Carl Grünberg]], [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Karl August Wittfogel]], were social scientists of an orthodox Marxist conviction. They understood their task as an advancement of the sciences that would prove useful in solving the problems of a Europe-wide transition into socialism, which they saw, if not as inevitable, at least as highly likely. But as [[fascism]] reared its head in Germany and throughout Europe, the younger members of the Institute saw the necessity for a different kind of Marxist Scholarship. Beyond accumulating knowledge relevant to an orthodox Marxist line, they felt the need to take the more critical and negative approach that is required for the maintenance of an integral and penetrating understanding of society during a moment of reaction. This could be described as the politically necessary transition from Marxist positive science to [[Critical Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Marco Torres [http://platypus1917.org/2008/05/01/the-science-that-wasnt/ "The science that wasn't: The orthodox Marxism of the early Frankfurt School and the turn to Marxist Critical Theory"]. ''Platypus''. May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In parallel to this, [[Cedric Robinson]] has identified a Black Marxist tradition, including people like [[C.L.R. James]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], who have opened Marxism to the study of race.

In the postwar period, the [[New Left]] and [[new social movements]] gave rise to intellectual and political currents which again challenged orthodox Marxism. These include Italian [[autonomism]], French [[Situationist International|Situationism]], the Yugoslavian [[Praxis School]], British [[cultural studies]], [[Marxist feminism]], [[Marxist humanism]], [[analytical Marxism]] and [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].

[[File:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]

'''Precession''' is a change in the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the rotational axis of a [[rotation|rotating]] body. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the first [[Euler angles|Euler angle]], whereas the third Euler angle defines the [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation itself]]. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called ''[[nutation]]''. In [[physics]], there are two types of precession: [[torque]]-free and torque-induced.

In astronomy, ''precession'' refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body's rotational or orbital parameters. An important example is the steady change in the orientation of the axis of rotation of the [[Earth]], known as the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]].

==Torque-free==
Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In torque-free precession, the [[angular momentum]] is a constant, but the [[angular velocity]] vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying [[moment of inertia]], or more precisely, a time-varying [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|inertia matrix]]. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate [[Basis (linear algebra)|coordinate axes]] (e.g. {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}}). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the [[Vector component#Decomposition|component]] of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis' moment of inertia.

The torque-free precession rate of an object with an axis of symmetry, such as a disk, spinning about an axis not aligned with that axis of symmetry can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

where {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the precession rate, {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the spin rate about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the moment of inertia about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} is moment of inertia about either of the other two equal perpendicular principal axes, and {{math|'''''α'''''}} is the angle between the moment of inertia direction and the symmetry axis.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an object is not perfectly [[solid]], internal [[vortices]] will tend to damp torque-free precession, and the rotation axis will align itself with one of the inertia axes of the body.

For a generic solid object without any axis of symmetry, the evolution of the object's orientation, represented (for example) by a rotation matrix {{math|'''''R'''''}} that transforms internal to external coordinates, may be numerically simulated. Given the object's fixed internal [[moment of inertia tensor]] {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and fixed external angular momentum {{math|'''''L'''''}}, the instantaneous angular velocity is
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol R \boldsymbol I_0^{-1} \boldsymbol R ^T \boldsymbol L&lt;/math&gt;
Precession occurs by repeatedly recalculating {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and applying a small [[Rotation representation (mathematics)#Euler axis and angle .28rotation vector.29|rotation vector]] {{math|'''''ω''' dt''}} for the short time {{math|''dt''}}; e.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol R_\text{new} = \exp\left(\left[\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R_\text{old}\right)\right]_{\times} dt\right) \boldsymbol R_\text{old}&lt;/math&gt;
for the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|skew-symmetric matrix]] {{math|['''''ω''''']&lt;sub&gt;×&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The errors induced by finite time steps tend to increase the rotational kinetic energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol \omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol L }{ 2}&lt;/math&gt;
this unphysical tendency can be counteracted by repeatedly applying a small rotation vector {{math|'''''v'''''}} perpendicular to both {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and {{math|'''''L'''''}}, noting that
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\exp\left(\left[\boldsymbol v\right]_{\times}\right) \boldsymbol R\right) \approx E\left(\boldsymbol R\right) + \left(\boldsymbol \omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) \times \boldsymbol L\right) \cdot \boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;

Another type of torque-free precession can occur when there are multiple reference frames at work. For example, Earth is subject to local torque induced precession due to the gravity of the sun and moon acting on Earth's axis, but at the same time the solar system is moving around the galactic center. As a consequence, an accurate measurement of Earth's axial reorientation relative to objects outside the frame of the moving galaxy (such as distant quasars commonly used as precession measurement reference points) must account for a minor amount of non-local torque-free precession, due to the solar system’s motion.

==Torque-induced==
Torque-induced precession ('''gyroscopic precession''') is the phenomenon in which the [[axis of rotation|axis]] of a spinning object (e.g., a [[gyroscope]]) describes a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] in space when an external [[torque]] is applied to it. The phenomenon is commonly seen in a [[spinning top|spinning toy top]], but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the [[speed]] of the rotation and the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at [[right angle]]s to the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the [[normal force]] (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on it at the point of contact with the support. These two opposite forces produce a torque which causes the top to precess.

[[Image:Gyroscopic precession 256x256.png|frame|right|The response of a rotating system to an applied torque. When the device swivels, and some roll is added, the wheel tends to pitch.]]
The device depicted on the right (or above on mobile devices) is [[gimbal]] mounted. From inside to outside there are three axes of rotation: the hub of the wheel, the gimbal axis, and the vertical pivot.

To distinguish between the two horizontal axes, rotation around the wheel hub will be called ''spinning'', and rotation around the gimbal axis will be called ''pitching''.  Rotation around the vertical pivot axis is called ''rotation''.

First, imagine that the entire device is rotating around the (vertical) pivot axis. Then, spinning of the wheel (around the wheelhub) is added. Imagine the gimbal axis to be locked, so that the wheel cannot pitch. The gimbal axis has sensors, that measure whether there is a [[torque]] around the gimbal axis.

In the picture, a section of the wheel has been named {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At the depicted moment in time, section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is at the [[perimeter]] of the rotating motion around the (vertical) pivot axis. Section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, therefore, has a lot of angular rotating [[velocity]] with respect to the rotation around the pivot axis, and as {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is forced closer to the pivot axis of the rotation (by the wheel spinning further), because of the [[Coriolis effect]], with respect to the vertical pivot axis, {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} tends to move in the direction of the top-left arrow in the diagram (shown at 45°) in the direction of rotation around the pivot axis.&lt;ref name="Teodorescu"&gt;{{cite book

Note that both arrows point in the same direction.

The same reasoning applies for the bottom half of the wheel, but there the arrows point in the opposite direction to that of the top arrows. Combined over the entire wheel, there is a torque around the gimbal axis when some spinning is added to rotation around a vertical axis.

It is important to note that the torque around the gimbal axis arises without any delay; the response is instantaneous.

In the discussion above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In the case of a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity – via the pitching motion – elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.

Precession or gyroscopic considerations have an effect on [[bicycle]] performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind [[gyrocompass]]es.

[[Image:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[torque]] caused by the normal force – {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the weight of the top causes a change in the [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to precess.]]

Precession is the change of [[angular velocity]] and [[angular momentum]] produced by a torque. The general equation that relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum is:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; are the torque and angular momentum vectors respectively.

Due to the way the torque vectors are defined, it is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the forces that create it. Thus it may be seen that the angular momentum vector will change perpendicular to those forces. Depending on how the forces are created, they will often rotate with the angular momentum vector, and then circular precession is created.

Under these circumstances the angular velocity of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\ mgr}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{ \tau}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the angular velocity of spin about the spin axis, {{math|''m''}} is the mass, {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity and {{math|''r''}} is the perpendicular distance of the spin axis about the axis of precession.  The torque vector originates at the center of mass. Using {{math|'''''ω''''' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''T''}}}}, we find that the [[Frequency|period]] of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{p} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ mgrT_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ \tau T_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the period of spin about the spin axis, and {{math|'''''τ'''''}} is the [[torque]]&lt;!-- Torque is not introduced --&gt;. In general, the problem is more complicated than this, however.

There is an easy way to understand why gyroscopic precession occurs without using any mathematics. The behavior of a spinning object simply obeys laws of inertia by resisting any change in direction. A spinning object possesses a property known as rigidity in space, meaning the spin axis resists any change in orientation. It is the inertia of matter comprising the object as it resists any change in direction that provides this property. Of course, the direction this matter travels constantly changes as the object spins, but any further change in direction is resisted. If a force is applied to the surface of a spinning disc, for example, matter experiences no change in direction at the place the force was applied (or 180 degrees from that place). But 90 degrees before and 90 degrees after that place, matter is forced to change direction. This causes the object to behave as if the force was applied at those places instead. When a force is applied to anything, the object exerts an equal force back but in the opposite direction. Since no actual force was applied 90 degrees before or after, nothing prevents the reaction from taking place, and the object causes itself to move in response. A good way to visualize why this happens is to imagine the spinning object to be a large hollow doughnut filled with water, as described in the book "Thinking Physics" by Lewis Epstein. The doughnut is held still while water circulates inside it. As the force is applied, the water inside is caused to change direction 90 degrees before and after that point. The water then exerts its own force against the inner wall of the doughnut and causes the doughnut to rotate as if the force was applied 90 degrees ahead in the direction of rotation. Epstein exaggerates the vertical and horizontal motion of the water by changing the shape of the doughnut from round to square with rounded corners.   

Now imagine the object to be a spinning bicycle wheel, held at both ends of its axle in the hands of a subject. The wheel is spinning clock-wise as seen from a viewer to the subject’s right. Clock positions on the wheel are given relative to this viewer. As the wheel spins, the molecules comprising it are traveling exactly horizontal and to the right the instant they pass the 12-o'clock position. They then travel vertically downward the instant they pass 3 o'clock, horizontally to the left at 6 o'clock, vertically upward at 9 o’clock and horizontally to the right again at 12 o'clock. Between these positions, each molecule travels components of these directions. Now imagine the viewer applying a force to the rim of the wheel at 12 o’clock. For this example’s sake, imagine the wheel tilting over when this force is applied; it tilts to the left as seen from the subject holding it at its axle. As the wheel tilts to its new position, molecules at 12 o’clock (where the force was applied) as well as those at 6 o’clock, still travel horizontally; their direction did not change as the wheel was tilting. Nor is their direction different after the wheel settles in its new position; they still move horizontally the instant they pass 12 and 6 o’clock. BUT, molecules passing 3 and 9 o’clock were forced to change direction. Those at 3 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight downward, to downward and to the right as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. Molecules passing 9 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight upward, to upward and to the left. This change in direction is resisted by the inertia of those molecules. And when they experience this change in direction, they exert an equal and opposite force in response AT THOSE LOCATIONS-3 AND 9 O’CLOCK. At 3 o’clock, where they were forced to change from moving straight down to downward and to the right, they exert their own equal and opposite reactive force to the left. At 9 o’clock, they exert their own reactive force to the right, as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. This makes the wheel as a whole react by momentarily rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from directly above. Thus, as the force was applied at 12 o’clock, the wheel behaved as if that force was applied at 3 o’clock, which is 90 degrees ahead in the direction of spin. Or, you can say it behaved as if a force from the opposite direction was applied at 9 o'clock, 90 degrees prior to the direction of spin.

In summary, when you apply a force to a spinning object to change the direction of its spin axis, you are not changing the direction of the matter comprising the object at the place you applied the force (nor at 180 degrees from it); matter experiences zero change in direction at those places. Matter experiences the maximum change in direction 90 degrees before and 90 degrees beyond that place, and lesser amounts closer to it. The equal and opposite reaction that occurs 90 degrees before and after then causes the object to behave as it does. This principle is demonstrated in helicopters. Helicopter controls are rigged so that inputs to them are transmitted to the rotor blades at points 90 degrees prior to and 90 degrees beyond the point at which the change in aircraft attitude is desired. The effect is dramatically felt on motorcycles. A motorcycle will suddenly lean and turn in the opposite direction the handle bars are turned.  

Gyro precession causes another phenomenon for spinning objects such as the bicycle wheel in this scenario. If the subject holding the wheel removes a hand from one end of its axle, the wheel will not topple over, but will remain upright, supported at just the other end. However, it will immediately take on an additional motion; it will begin to rotate about a vertical axis, pivoting at the point of support as it continues spinning. If you allowed the wheel to continue rotating, you would have to turn your body in the same direction as the wheel rotated. If the wheel was not spinning, it would obviously topple over and fall when one hand is removed. The initial action of the wheel beginning to topple over is equivalent to applying a force to it at 12 o'clock in the direction toward the unsupported side (or a force at 6 o’clock toward the supported side). When the wheel is spinning, the sudden lack of support at one end of its axle is equivalent to this same force. So, instead of toppling over, the wheel behaves as if a continuous force is being applied to it at 3 or 9 o’clock, depending on the direction of spin and which hand was removed. This causes the wheel to begin pivoting at the one supported end of its axle while remaining upright. Although it pivots at that point, it does so only because of the fact that it is supported there; the actual axis of precessional rotation is located vertically through the wheel, passing through its center of mass. Also, this explanation does not account for the effect of variation in the speed of the spinning object; it only illustrates how the spin axis behaves due to precession. More correctly, the object behaves according to the balance of all forces based on the magnitude of the applied force, mass and rotational speed of the object. Once it is visualized why the wheel remains upright and rotates, it can easily be seen why the axis of a spinning top slowly rotates while the top spins as shown in the illustration on this page. A top behaves exactly like the bicycle wheel due to the force of gravity pulling downward. The point of contact with the surface it spins on is equivalent to the end of the axle the wheel is supported at. As the top's spin slows, the reactive force that keeps it upright due to inertia is overcome by gravity. Once the reason for gyro precession is visualized, the mathematical formulas start to make sense. 

===Relativistic (Einsteinian) ===
The special and general theories of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] give three types of corrections to the Newtonian precession, of a gyroscope near a large mass such as Earth, described above. They are:
* [[Thomas precession]] a special relativistic correction accounting for the observer's being in a rotating non-inertial frame.
* [[Geodetic effect|de Sitter precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the Schwarzschild metric of curved space near a large non-rotating mass.
* [[Lense–Thirring precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the frame dragging by the Kerr metric of curved space near a large rotating mass.

== Astronomy ==

In astronomy, precession refers to any of several gravity-induced, slow and continuous changes in an astronomical body's rotational axis or orbital path. Precession of the equinoxes, perihelion precession, changes in the [[Axial tilt#Earth|tilt of Earth's axis]] to its orbit, and the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of its orbit over tens of thousands of years are all important parts of the astronomical theory of [[ice age]]s. ''(See [[Milankovitch cycles]].)''

=== Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes) ===
{{Main article|Axial precession}}

Axial precession is the movement of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the ''precession of the equinoxes'', ''lunisolar precession'', or ''precession of the equator''. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both [[equatorial coordinates]] and [[ecliptic longitude]]. Over this cycle, Earth's north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of [[Polaris]], in a circle around the [[ecliptic pole]], with an angular radius of about 23.5°.

The [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek astronomer]] [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190-120 BC) is claimed to be the earliest known astronomer to recognize and assess the precession of the equinoxes at about 1° per century (which is not far from the actual value for antiquity, 1.38°).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w91.pdf DIO 9.1 ‡3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caltech]]'s Swerdlow disputes Hipparchus's knowledge of precession because Hipparchus apparently did not necessarily indicate anything like a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The gravitational [[tidal force]]s of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]] apply torque to the equator, attempting to pull the [[equatorial bulge]] into the plane of the [[ecliptic]], but instead causing it to precess. The torque exerted by the planets, particularly [[Jupiter]], also plays a role.&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;

===Apsidal precession===
[[File:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|thumb|[[Apsidal precession]]—the orbit rotates gradually over time.]]
{{main|Apsidal precession}}

The [[orbit]]s of planets around the [[Sun]] do not really follow an identical ellipse each time, but actually trace out a flower-petal shape because the major axis of each planet's elliptical orbit also precesses within its orbital plane, partly in response to perturbations in the form of the changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. This is called [[apsidal precession|perihelion precession or apsidal precession]].

In the adjunct image, Earth's apsidal precession is illustrated. As the Earth travels around the Sun, its elliptical orbit rotates gradually over time. The eccentricity of its ellipse and the precession rate of its orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and stationary.

Discrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and that predicted by [[classical mechanics]] were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] (in particular, his [[General relativity|General Theory of Relativity]]), which accurately predicted the anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and Earth.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/03/18-billion-suns.html An even larger value for a precession has been found, for a black hole in orbit around a much more massive black hole, amounting to 39 degrees each orbit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deviating from Newton's law, Einstein's theory of gravitation predicts an extra term of {{math|{{sfrac|''A''|''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43″ every 100 years.

The gravitational force between the Sun and moon induces the precession in Earth's orbit, which is the major cause of the climate oscillation of Earth that has a period of 19,000 to 23,000 years. It follows that changes in Earth's orbital parameters (e.g., orbital inclination, the angle between Earth's rotation axis and its plane of orbit) is important to the study of Earth's climate, in particular to the study of past ice ages.

The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

This pressure difference holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.|The pressure on a suction cup as exerted by collisions of gas molecules holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.]]
[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|thumb|right|One cup suction lifter.]]

A '''suction cup''', also known as a '''sucker''', is a device or object that uses the negative [[Pressure#Fluid pressure|fluid pressure]] of air or water to adhere to [[Porosity|nonporous]] surfaces, creating a [[Vacuum|partial vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suction%20cup|title="Suction Cup" m-w.com |publisher=Merriam Webster: An Encyclopædia Britannica Company |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups are peripherial traits of some animals such as [[octopus]]es and [[squid]]s, and have been reproduced artificially for numerous purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/48054-octopus-inspired-technology.html|title=Well-Armed Design: 8 Octopus-Inspired Technologies |publisher=livescience.com |accessdate= July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

The working face of the suction cup is made of elastic, flexible material and has a curved surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2055397|title="Suction Cup" google.com |publisher=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the center of the suction cup is pressed against a flat, non-porous surface, the volume of the space between the suction cup and the flat surface is reduced, which causes the air or water between the cup and the surface to be expelled past the rim of the circular cup. The cavity which develops between the cup and the flat surface has little to no air or water in it because most of the fluid has already been forced out of the inside of the cup, causing a lack of pressure. The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of the cup and the low-pressure cavity on the inside of the cup keeps the cup adhered to the surface.

When the user ceases to apply physical pressure to the outside of the cup, the elastic substance of which the cup is made tends to resume its original, curved shape. The length of time for which the suction effect can be maintained depends mainly on how long it takes for air or water to leak back into the cavity between the cup and the surface, equalizing the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere. This depends on the porosity and flatness of the surface and the properties of the cup's rim.

== Calculations ==
The force required to detach an ideal suction cup by pulling it directly away from the surface is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F = AP&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''F'' is the [[force]],
:''A'' is the area of the surface covered by the cup,
:''P'' is the pressure outside the cup (typically [[atmospheric pressure]])

This is derived from the definition of pressure, which is:
:&lt;math&gt;P = F/A&lt;/math&gt;
For example, a suction cup of radius 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm has an area of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;(0.020 m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0013 square meters. Using the force formula (''F'' = ''AP''), the result is
''F'' = (0.0013 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(100,000 Pa) = about 130 [[newton (unit)|newtons]].

The above formula relies on several assumptions:
# The outer diameter of the cup does not change when the cup is pulled.
# No air leaks into the gap between the cup and the surface.
# The pulling force is applied perpendicular to the surface so that the cup does not slide sideways or peel off.

== Artificial use ==
[[File:Mobiles Navigationsgeraet Navigon im Einsatz.JPG|thumb|right|[[SatNav]] devices often ship with suction cup holders for mounting on windscreens.]]
[[File:GoPro camera mounted on car.jpg|thumb|GoPro camera attached to car with suction cup]]

Artificial suction cups are believed to have first been used in the third century, [[Anno Domini|B.C.]], and were made out of [[gourd]]s. They were used to suction "bad blood" from internal organs to the surface. [[Hippocrates]] is believed to have invented this procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first modern suction cup patents were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office during the 1860s. TC Roche was awarded U.S. Patent No. 52,748 in 1866 for a "Photographic Developer Dipping Stick"; the patent discloses a primitive suction cup means for handling photographic plates during developing procedures. In 1868, Orwell Needham patented a more refined suction cup design, U.S. Patent No. 82,629, calling his invention an "Atmospheric Knob" purposed for general use as a handle and drawer opening means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US52748 |title=United States Patent 52,748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US82629 |title=United States Patent 82,629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have.

Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions.

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion''''' (1st imp. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[New Jersey]] 1952, [[Princeton University Press]], 169 pp) is a philosophy book written by [[Walter Terence Stace]]. At the time of writing, Stace was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he had worked since 1932 after a 22-year career in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. ''Time and Eternity'' was one of his first books about the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[mysticism]], after writing throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s that was influenced by [[Phenomenalism|phenomenalist]] philosophy.

In his introduction Stace writes that ''Time and Eternity'' is an attempt to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He explains that the basic idea set out in the book is that all religious thought is symbolic, and that his influences include [[Rudolf Otto]], especially his ''Mysticism East and West'', and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He says he was motivated to write the book in an attempt to add to the "other half of the truth which I now think naturalism [as espoused in his 1947 essay ''Man Against Darkness''] misses".

The book begins by looking at religion, specifically God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He goes on to say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter asks what religion is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, is rooted in [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]], and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the [[Apophatic theology|negative divine]] - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, it is only the theories about it that differ.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1952) ''Time and Eternity''.  [[Princeton University Press]]. P. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is not that the mystic has an experience, even a direct vision, of God. For in that case God would be the object for the soul as subject. The distinction between God and the soul, as object and subject respectively, is wholly done away with. The soul passes into the being of God, becomes God, is God."

| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Stace then goes on to explain that all religions say that religious revelation is [[ineffability|ineffable]], because no words or concepts can be applied to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace then looks at the [[Cataphatic theology|positive divine]]; he asks how concepts can be applied to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).

[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|200px|"Thus when Plotinus speaks of "the flight of the alone to the Alone,"… [this] evoke[s] in us a measure of the same experience which the author of them had."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Next Stace explains that there are two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and the [[noumenon]], although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at symbolism in religion, Stace states that there are two types of predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a [[hierarchy of being]], and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the [[numinous|numen]] and qualities found in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace next looks at religion’s claims to truth. He draws an analogy between mystical illumination and aesthetic truth, as the truths of both rest on revelation rather than reason. "Either you directly perceive beauty, or you do not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, or you do not."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he maintains the arguments of both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.

| style="text-align: left;" | "What is the meaning of the metaphor of intersection? This intersection means precisely what the eternal moment is experienced to be. It is one and the same human consciousness which experiences both the temporal or natural world and that eternal and infinite order which is disclosed in mystical illumination."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These separate spheres lead Stace to reflect on both [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|proofs for God]] and [[acosmism]]. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, is a direct result of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "The pure religious consciousness lies in a region which is forever beyond all proof or disproof. This is a necessary consequence of the "utterly other" character of God from the world, and of the "utterly other" character of the world from God. The eternal order is not the natural order, and the natural order is not the eternal order. The two orders intersect, but in the intersection each remains what it is. Each is wholly self-contained. Therefore, it is impossible to pass, by any logical inference, from one to the other. This at once precludes as impossible any talk either of the proof or disproof of religion."

| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In the final chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns to the idea that theology and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of [[Vedanta]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]]) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.

[[File:Ikone Athanasius von Alexandria.jpg|thumb|200px|“[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|The Upanishad]] says flatly that Brahman "is incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended". [[Creed of St. Athanasius|The creed of St. Athanasius]] agrees with the Upanishad: 
'The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, 
the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. . . . 
Yet not three incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Critical response==

[[Virgil Aldrich|Virgil C Aldrich]] reviewed the book alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind'' and ''The Gate of Silence'', also by Stace and published in 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a [[David Hume|Hume]] or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it is difficult to determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil Aldrich|Aldrich, Virgil C.]] (Jan. 21, 1954). "Book Reviews", ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', 51(2), 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Seelye Bixler|Julius Seelye Bixler]] reviewed the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review he wrote that he believed Stace was trying to have his cake and eat it with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Oct., 1952). "Book Reviews", ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion|The Journal of Bible and Religion]]'', 20(4), 272-274, OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he reviewed ''Time and Eternity'' alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind''. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Jul 1953). "Reviews of Books", ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 62(3), 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace was praised for his clarity and ambitious aims in ''Time and Eternity'' by [[Abraham Kaplan]] who believed the book was one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of [[Samuel Alexander]]. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kaplan|Kaplan, Abraham]] (Oct 1953). "Book Reviews", ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', 3(3), 1953, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noting the unachievable ambition of solving the conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were to approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|''Tractatus'']]: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Martin A. (Mar. 1953). "Reviews", ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'',13(3), 416-417.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy M. Emmet]] found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmet, Dorothy, M.]] (Jan 1954). "New Books", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', 29(108), 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Maurice Friedman writes about the book in the context of the various attempts to find a universal essence - or [[perennial philosophy]] - within religion. He finds that ''Time and Eternity'' is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by [[Aldous Huxley]] or [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Maurice. (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hnWXeuZN2MoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 A Heart of Wisdom: Religion and Human Wholeness]'' [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 98-100. {{ISBN|9781438403366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received more positive support however. [[Robert Cummings Neville|Robert C Neville]] called ''Time and Eternity'' “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and time in our century so far”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cummings Neville|Neville, Robert Cummings]]. (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUYCRhDooAC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236 Eternity and Time's Flow]'', [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|9780791415993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Thought: [[A Very Short Introduction]]'', Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne, Tim. (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIo9QLwjh4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 Thought: A Very Short Introduction]'' Oxford University Press. p. 121. {{ISBN|9780199601721}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Arthur Goldwag has said that the phrase "that than which there is no other" that he encountered in ''Time and Eternity'' was one of a number of factors that contributed to him giving up praying.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwag, Arthur (October 9, 2009) [http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/ ''Confession: Why I Don't Pray'']. Killing the Buddha magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Kwakiutl1.jpg|center|255px]]|caption=A [[totem pole]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada}}
A '''totem''' ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''[[doodem]]'') is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of [[people]], such as a [[family]], [[clan]], [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]], or [[tribe]].

While the term ''totem'' is derived from the North American [[Ojibwe]] language, belief in [[Tutelary deity|tutelary spirits and deities]] is not limited to [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] but common to a number of cultures worldwide. However, the traditional people of those cultures have words for their guardian spirits in their own languages, and do not call these spirits or symbols "totems".

Contemporary [[Neoshamanism|neoshamanic]], [[New Age]], and [[mythopoetic men's movement]]s not otherwise involved in the practice of a tribal religion have been known to use "totem" terminology for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or [[Spirit guide|guide]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 24.3 (2000) pp. 329–352. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American totem poles===
{{Main|Totem pole}}
[[Totem pole]]s of the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] are [[monument]]al poles of [[heraldry]]. They feature many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of families or chiefs. They recount stories owned by those families or chiefs, or commemorate special occasions.&lt;ref name=GarfieldForrest&gt;{{cite book|author= Viola E. Garfield and Linn A. Forrest, |year=1961| title=The Wolf and the Raven: Totem Poles of Southeastern Alaska |page=1 |location=Seattle| publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|isbn=0-295-73998-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbeau&gt;{{cite journal | author= Marius Barbeau| title =Totem Poles: According to Crests and Topics | journal = National Museum of Canada Bulletin | volume =119 | issue =1 | page =9 | publisher = Dept. of Resources and Development, National Museum of Canada | location = Ottawa | date =1950  | url = http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/barbeau/mbp0502e.shtml| accessdate =24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are known to be read from the bottom of the pole to the top.

==Anthropological perspectives==
[[Image:Totem Park pole 1.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[totem pole]] in Thunderbird Park, [[Victoria, British Columbia]]]]

Totemism is a [[belief]] associated with [[animism|animistic]] religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan.

Scottish [[ethnologist]] [[John Ferguson McLennan]], following the vogue of 19th-century research, addressed totemism in a broad perspective in his study ''The Worship of Animals and Plants'' (1869, 1870).&lt;ref name=MacLennan1&gt;MacLennan, J., ''The worship of animals and plants'', ''[[Fortnightly Review]], vol. 6-7 (1869-1870)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Wolfe|title=Settler Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdhnThYIgGAC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=22 December 1998|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-304-70340-1|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan did not seek to explain the specific origin of the totemistic phenomenon but sought to indicate that all of the human race had, in [[ancient times]], gone through a totemistic stage.&lt;ref name=MacLennan1/&gt;

Another Scottish scholar, [[Andrew Lang]], early in the 20th century, advocated a [[Nominalism|nominalistic]] explanation of totemism, namely, that local groups or clans, in selecting a totemistic name from the realm of nature, were reacting to a need to be differentiated.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;Andrew Lang A., ''Method in the Study of Totemism'' (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; If the origin of the name was forgotten, Lang argued, there followed a mystical relationship between the object — from which the name was once derived — and the groups that bore these names. Through nature myths, animals and natural objects were considered as the relatives, patrons, or ancestors of the respective social units.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;

British anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] published ''Totemism and Exogamy'' in 1910, a four-volume work based largely on his research among [[Indigenous peoples of Australia]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|Melanesia]], along with a compilation of the work of other writers in the field.&lt;ref name=Frazer1&gt;''Totemism and Exogamy. A Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society'' (1911-1915)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Russian American ethnologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], subjected totemistic phenomena to sharp criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenweiser A., ''Totemism; An analytical study'', 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of a French school of sociology, [[Émile Durkheim]], examined totemism from a [[sociological]] and theological point of view, attempting to discover a pure religion in very ancient forms and claimed to see the [[origin of religion]] in totemism.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., ''Totémisme'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading representative of British social anthropology, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]], took a totally different view of totemism. Like [[Franz Boas]], he was skeptical that totemism could be described in any unified way. In this he opposed the other pioneer of social anthropology in England, Bronisław Malinowski, who wanted to confirm the unity of totemism in some way and approached the matter more from a biological and psychological point of view than from an ethnological one. According to Malinowski, totemism was not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of trying to satisfy basic human needs within the natural world. As far as Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, totemism was composed of elements that were taken from different areas and institutions, and what they have in common is a general tendency to characterize segments of the community through a connection with a portion of nature. In opposition to Durkheim's theory of sacralization, Radcliffe-Brown took the point of view that nature is introduced into the social order rather than secondary to it. At first, he shared with Malinowski the opinion that an animal becomes totemistic when it is “good to eat.” He later came to oppose the usefulness of this viewpoint, since many totems—such as crocodiles and flies—are dangerous and unpleasant.&lt;ref name=Radcliffe-Brown1&gt;Radcliffe-Brown A., ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

As a chief representative of modern [[structuralism]], French ethnologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and his, ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui'' ("Totemism Today" [1958])&lt;ref name=L-S1&gt;(Lévi-Strauss C., ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui''(1958); english  trans.  as  ''Totemism'', by [[Rodney Needham]]. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; are often cited in the field.

===Literature===
Poets, and to a lesser extent fiction writers, often use anthropological concepts, including the anthropological understanding of totemism. For this reason literary criticism often resorts to psychoanalytic, anthropological analyses.&lt;ref name=Maryniak&gt;Maryniak, Irena. Spirit of the Totem: Religion and Myth in Soviet Fiction, 1964-1988, MHRA, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Henk de. Freud's Theory and Its Use in Literary and Cultural Studies: An Introduction.

[[File:EarthTransit2084.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon transiting the Sun in 2084, as seen from Mars. Image created using JPL Solar System Simulator&lt;!--In case we reach 2084 and can't get an image :) --&gt;]]

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

|}

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].
