      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">'''Advanced Skills Teacher''' is a role in a [[state school|maintained school]] in England and Wales. Advanced Skills Teachers are judged through external assessment against a range of criteria to demonstrate excellent classroom teaching practice. They are employed in Advanced Skills Teacher posts in roles which include an element of work dedicated to supporting teaching colleagues in their own schools, and other schools in the area, to improve their own practice. The role was introduced in 1998 to reward excellent teachers who chose to stay working in classrooms, rather than following other routes to promotion through leadership.

==Introduction of the role==
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election of 1997]] included a statement that they would "create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best."&lt;ref name="labour"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/3labmaneduc.html |title=The Labour Party's Manifesto 1997 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |work=BBC News 'Election 97' website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305141231/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/3labmaneduc.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to ensure that teachers who excelled in the classroom were given both financial incentive and career-path options to allow them to continue in that role, providing a role model of high quality teaching.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm49/4990/4990-04.htm|title=Development of the pay and career structures|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=2001|author =School Teachers' Review Body|work=School Teachers' Review Body Tenth Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its election in May of that year, the new government brought forward the [[white paper]], ''Excellence in Schools'', which outlined proposals for the new grade of teacher.&lt;ref name="ucc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/RED/V63I0/630048.pdf|title=`Superteachers': The views of teachers and head teachers on the Advanced Skills Teacher grade|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|author1=Blake, D. |author2=Hanley, V. |author3=Jennings, M. |author4=Lloyd, M. |work=Research in Education|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Employment]], [[David Blunkett]], released additional details about the nature and pay relating to the posts in March 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/61246.stm|title= 'Super-teachers' to receive super salaries|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC News website | date=1998-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, regulations were put in place to provide funding for the role,&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1998/19981741.htm|title=The Education (Grants for Education Support and Training) (England) Regulations 1998 (Amendment) Regulations 1998|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|year=1998|work=OPSI website}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the grade being formally introduced from September 1998.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

==Responsibilities of the role==
Advanced Skills Teachers (ASTs) are given additional non-teaching time to allow them to share their teaching skills with colleagues both within their own school, and in other schools in the local area. This time normally amounts to a minimum 20% of the working week.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ast/|title=Advanced Skills Teachers: Promoting Excellence|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=The Standards Site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215341/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ast/|archivedate=2008-12-18|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time, ASTs are expected to undertake a range of tasks related to the raising of standards of teaching and learning in classrooms. These include, although are not limited to:
*supporting colleagues who are failing to meet high standards
*advising colleagues on pedagogical matters
*providing 'model' lessons to demonstrate excellent practice
*supporting the [[Induction (teachers)|induction]] of new teachers
*leading professional development of teachers.&lt;ref name="standards"/&gt;
It is expected that a considerable amount of this work will be undertaken in schools other than the teacher's own school as part of outreach schemes. This may involve working in liaison with the [[Local Education Authority]].&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/professionaldevelopment/ast/faqs/role/ |title=Frequently asked questions: Advanced Skills Teachers |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families |year=2006 |work=Teachernet Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804080059/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/professionaldevelopment/ast/faqs/role/ |archivedate=2008-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and appointment==
To become an Advanced Skills Teacher, a qualified teacher must first be assessed as meeting the professional standards of the role. In addition, they must be appointed to a specially-created Advanced Skills Teacher post.&lt;ref name="stpcd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/12833/2008%20STPCD.pdf |title=School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419144550/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/12833/2008%20STPCD.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be assessed as an AST, a teacher must demonstrate that they are able to meet the professional standards for the role. There are three stated standards relating to the role of AST, but in addition, applicants must also meet the subsumed standards of an Excellent teacher - a separate role as defined by government policy. There are a total of 28 standards to be met, falling under three main categories:
*Professional attributes
*Professional knowledge and understanding
*Professional skills

Teachers applying for AST posts must meet an external assessor who will judge the postholder against the criteria before being appointed to the post.&lt;ref name="astapp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11903/3674%20AST_Main%20Scale%20form_Eng_2007.pdf |title=Advanced Skills Teacher (AST): Application for assessment for main scale teachers |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and families |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702081928/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11903/3674%20AST_Main%20Scale%20form_Eng_2007.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay and conditions==
When the role of AST was first introduced, it was accompanied by a 27-point pay scale separate from that of classroom teachers or school managers. In its review of school teachers' pay in 2004, the School Teachers' Review Body recommended a change to the scale with effect from September 2006. Since that time, Advanced Skills Teachers have been paid on a scale of 18 pay points, which is identical to the first 18 points range of the Leadership pay scale, which is used for [[Head teacher]]s, and Deputy and Assistant Headteachers.&lt;ref name="strb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/6282/strbreptmar04.pdf |title=School Teachers’ Review Body Thirteenth Report – Part 2 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2004 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701110359/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/6282/strbreptmar04.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike teachers employed on the main pay scale, Advanced Skills Teachers are not subject to the limits on working time of 195 days per academic year, or 1265 directed hours per year. Head teachers are, however, required to ensure that Advanced Skills Teachers have a reasonable work/life balance.&lt;ref name="stpcd"/&gt;

==History==
Formerly called '''Agodi Zoological and Botanical Gardens''', Agodi Gardens was created in 1967. The garden was destroyed by the Ogunpa flood disaster in 1980 as most of the animals were swept away by the raging water. The garden was renovated in 2012 by the Oyo State Government and the new Agodi Gardens was reopened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Obuekwe|first1=Chiamaka|title=Review of Agodi Gardens|url=https://m.guardian.ng/life/travel-and-places/review-of-agodi-gardens/|accessdate=16 April 2018|publisher=[[The Guardian (Nigeria)]]|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fiddler in Wichita Riverfest.jpg|thumb|Fiddler in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] Riverfest]]
'''American fiddle'''-playing began with the early settlers who found that the small ''viol'' family instruments were portable and rugged. According to Ron Yule, "John Utie, a 1620 immigrant, settled in the North and is credited as being the first known fiddler on American soil".&lt;ref name="louisianafolklife1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/LFF_FiddlingInLouisiana.html |title=Living Traditions: Articles and Essays |publisher=Louisianafolklife.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early influences were Irish fiddle styles as well as Scottish and the more refined traditions of classical violin playing. Popular tunes included "[[Soldier's Joy (fiddle tune)|Soldier's Joy]]", for which [[Robert Burns]] had written lyrics, and other such tunes as "Flowers of Edinburgh" and "[[Tamlin]]," which were claimed by both Scottish and Irish lineages.

Soon these tunes were Americanized; local variations developed in the Northern and Southern colonies. In contemporary American fiddle styles, the [[New England]] states are heavily influenced by all Celtic styles, including [[Cape Breton]] fiddle-playing; whereas Southern or "Dixie" fiddle styles have tended to develop their own traditions, which emphasize [[double stop]]s and in some instances the incorporation of dance calls or simple lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rye Whiskey, fiddle tune&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary fusionist trends==

In a radical departure from tradition, groups such as Trio Chipontepec are cropping up at American fiddle festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html |title=Early Look at 2011 Festival of American Fiddle Tunes Faculty - Fiddle Tunes at Centrum |publisher=Centrum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110705062212/http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html| archivedate= 5 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock is fusing with country, jazz with rock, and classical violinists are retooling in an era characterized by home recording studios and the easy availability of [[new media]] such as MP3 downloads.

==Fiddle playing distinguished from violin playing==

Some folk fiddlers distinguish "fiddle" from "violin", though this is far from universal - many classical violinists refer to their "fiddle". Nevertheless, a few common differences may be observed;

===Instrument===
Generally, the setup of the instruments is different:

* Fiddle bridge top may be slightly flatter
* String action height may be lower
* Strings more often steel than synthetic or gut
* Fiddle more commonly set up with pickup
* Fiddle more commonly set up with four fine tuners; violinists more likely to use a single tailpiece E tuner

===Playing technique===

Fiddle playing generally avoids vibrato except for occasional slow tempo pieces and even then uses less [[vibrato]]. Shorter bow strokes are also consistent with the fiddle players' tendency to use less [[legato]] and more [[detache]] bow strokes. Some, but not all, styles use double stops and open tunings. [[Trick fiddling]] is employed, often built upon [[cross bowing]] technique such as used in [[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]] or [[Beaumont Rag]].
Bowing by fiddle players is quite different in that they may intentionally grip the frog in a crude manner and typically choke up on the bow. See for instance Rhiannon Giddens of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNaK_nBp2Yc&amp;NR=1 Massachusetts performance] of ''Genuine Negro Jig'' in May 2010.

===Fiddle repertoire distinguished===

Fiddle players tend to play fiddle "tunes" rather than sonatas and other classical types of compositions. There are exceptions. For instance, [[partita]]s have been popular with fiddle players, particularly since publication of the Open House CD by [[Kevin Burke (musician)|Kevin Burke]], an Irish style player based in Portland, Oregon. Fiddles are typically associated with country and other genres of popular music while violins are usually associated with classical and other genres of art music.

==Types of tunes==
[[File:HillbillyFamilyBandDLange.jpg|thumb|Woman playing fiddle (right) with her family in a California migrant camp, 1939]]
* [[Reel (dance)|Reels]]
* [[Hornpipe]]s
* [[Polka]]s
* [[Jig]]s
** Slip Jigs
** Double Jigs
* [[Waltz]]es
* Songs with lyrics

=== Canonical Tunes ===

==== Orange Blossom Special ====
{{Main article|Orange Blossom Special (song)}}
Also known as "OBS", Orange Blossom Special exploits the capacity of fiddle or violin to imitate various mechanical tones. Authorship is controversial.

==== The Devil Went Down to Georgia ====
The canonical American fiddle tune, "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]" was written by [[Charlie Daniels]] as an interpretation the "Lonesome Fiddle Blues" by Vassar Clements and has been covered innumerable times. Although classified as [[country rock]], the tune uses licks based on old-time fiddle playing and rock guitar riffs. Unlike most old-time playing, the instrument ranges high up the neck, exploiting both the legendary association of the fiddle as "the devil's instrument" and the intensity of rapid sixteenth or thirty-second notes. These effects are achieved through rapid detache bowing bordering on outright [[tremolo]]. The motif of a [[deal with the Devil]] may have been influenced by [[Cross Road Blues]], by Delta blues singer Robert Johnson.

==Blues fiddle==

According to London-based music writer Chris Haigh, fiddle  " was among the primary instruments used by the rural blacks..." &lt;ref&gt;name=Haigh http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/blues/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that by  1930 over 50 different black blues fiddle players had recordings. Many musicians who were guitar stars also played fiddle including:

* [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]]
* [[Big Bill Broonzy]]
* [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]

[[Blues]] fiddle uses the pentatonic blues scale to create riffs for breaks and over guitar chords typically in the standard [[blues progression]]. Vibrato is not often used, although may occasionally be used in an exaggerated manner for special effect.

==Old time fiddle==
{{Main article|Old time fiddle}}
Old time fiddle uses a profusion of double stops and authentic players typically tune their instruments in "open tunings" or [[Scordatura|cross tunings]]. The set ups often include flattened bridges and in some cases no chin rest. The most popular tuning ia AEAE for the key of A, but the instrument can be down tuned to GDGD, which may put less tension on the neck when playing solo. ADAE is also popular for the key of D, and standard (GDAE) is often used for G. Some of the earliest popular repertoire includes "Turkey in the Straw," "Arkansas Traveler," "Billy in the Lowground." Accompanying instruments include washboard, jug bass, banjo, dulcimer, guitar, and occasionally kazoo.

According to some sources, old time music is actually the "early recorded country music of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly of the southeastern states" thus narrowing the definition considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmet Baycu |url=http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm |title=Roots of American Fiddle Music |publisher=1001tunes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054457/http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a broader definition usually prevails which incorporates unrecorded music with roots long before radio transmission and sound recording were invented. Within old time music there are regional subgenres, such as the Deep South and Appalachia, where fiddle music is often intertwined with cultural phenomena such as [[Appalachian music#Coal mining and protest music|coal mining]].

A comprehensive review of old time fiddle styles was written by David Reiner and Peter Anick and published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Oldtime Fiddling Across America, by David Reiner and Peter Anick (1989), Mel Bay Publications. {{ISBN|0-87166-766-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bluegrass fiddle==

[[Bluegrass music]] originated in the person of Bill Monroe. According to Haigh, "Monroe always considered the fiddle to be the key instrument of bluegrass".&lt;ref name="fiddlingaround1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/bluegrass/index.html |title=Bluegrass Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chubby Wise]] Played with Monroe. Also a Texas Swing player &lt;ref name="fiddlingaround1"/&gt;
* [[Byron Berline]] a bluegrass player, has appeared with the Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers
* [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] Played with Monroe. Classical training, old time. Band: Seatrain. tric violin. COMPOSITION: "What if Mozart had played with Bill Monroe; a concerto for violin and orchestra"

==Cajun fiddle==
According to Ron Yule, "Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 15th century in Scotland."&lt;ref name="louisianafolklife1"/&gt; The most widely known Cajun fiddler is [[Doug Kershaw]].

[[Zydeco]] music is closely related.

==Rock fiddle==
{{Main article|Electric violin}}
Rock fiddle, like rock music in general, owes much to American blues. Incorporation of fiddle or violin into rock, as with jazz, has been a slow process, resisted by some critics as an"unlikeliest and perverse misuse of an instrument".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/rock%20violin/index.html |title=Rock Violin |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has roots in [[folk music]] particularly the [[American folk revival]] of the 1960s, and thus as a matter of usage some writers refer to "rock fiddle" when discussing playing by classically trained musicians who join rock bands and thus import classical style rather than fiddle style into their playing.

* [[Papa John Creach]] ([[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Hot Tuna]]) played in a style more closely approaching true fiddle as opposed to violinistic style.
* [[Sugar Cane Harris]] (violin,technically), played with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Little Richard]] and  [[Johnny Otis]].
* [[Jerry Goodman]] (violin, technically), with [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]'s album ''[[Birds of Fire]]''.
* [[Scarlet Rivera]] (violin, technically), played with [[Bob Dylan]] on "[[Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)|Hurricane]]".
* [[David LaFlamme]] (violin, technically) (born Gary Posie), [[It's A Beautiful Day]], also performed with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]].

Rock violinists often use solid body [[electric violin]]s to reduce feedback. Rock is an international phenomenon and is consequently influenced by cross fertilizations from rock players such as Ashley MacIsaac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brad Wheeler |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/why-ashley-macisaac-decided-to-rock-his-fiddle/article2065835/ |title=Why Ashley MacIsaac decided to rock his fiddle |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, American rockers continue to experiment. For instance, eclectic rocker Natalie Stovall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nataliestovall.com/2011/01/29/amarillo-article-about-todays-show/ |title=News – Amarillo Globe-News Article « Natalie Stovall |publisher=Nataliestovall.com |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326083848/http://www.nataliestovall.com/2011/01/29/amarillo-article-about-todays-show/ |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of Berkelee Conservatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm |title=Natalie Stovall - Indie Artist Spotlight on |publisher=Countrystarsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110704090815/http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm| archivedate= 4 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers [[Led Zeppelin]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[The White Stripes]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], all the while alternating between standard rock vocals and fiddle/violin riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnRjMq_kDVU |title=Natalie Stovall - Crazy Rock/Fiddle Medley - Chicago |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock fiddle or violin players include

* [[Rufus Thibodeaux]] ([[Neil Young]])
* [[John Cale]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] notable tracks include "Heroin"

==American jazz fiddle==
{{see also|Stuff Smith|Joe Venuti|Noel Pointer|Western swing fiddle}}
Jazz playing on the fiddle is often called jazz violin but there are some instances in which "jazz fiddle" is discussed. For instance Mel Bay contributor Martin Norgard presents jazz fiddle in numerous media (book, website).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm |title=A Practical Guide To Jazz Improvising For Strings |publisher=Jazz Fiddle Wizard |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024330/http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, instructional jazz playing was preceded by  the highly influential 1992 Oak Publications volume Jazz Violin" by Matt Glaser and [[Stephane Grapelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jazz Violin| Grappelli and Glaser| Publisher: Music Sales America |(January 1, 1992)|{{ISBN|0-8256-0194-0}}|{{ISBN|978-0-8256-0194-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic is indeed covered on the Wikipedia online encyclopedia at the article page entitled [[Jazz violin]]. Australian jazz player [[Ian Cooper (violinist)|Ian Cooper]] is presented as a violinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iancooper.com/ian_cooper_biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Ian Cooper |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch eclectic player Tim Kliphuis presents his jazz instructional material as "Jazz Swing Violin Fiddle" but his website quotes the Glasgow Herald review which denominates hims as a "splendid young...violinist".

== Texas swing ==
{{see also|Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys|Chris Daring|Buddy Spicher|Benny Thomasson}}
This music, usually considered to be synonymous with [[Western swing]], is ''bona fide'' fiddle music and is deeply intertwined with country and folk music as played by Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Dale Watson, the Wheel's Jason Roberts, Jesse Dayton, and Garrison Keillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnygimble.com/ |title=Welcome to Johnny Gimble's world of Texas Swing! |publisher=Johnnygimble.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102847/http://www.johnnygimble.com/| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known example of this music is "[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]", which despite some controversy is generally attributed to Bob Wills.:&lt;ref&gt;^ Wolff, Country Music, p. 112: "It ['Faded Love'] originated with western swing pioneer Bob Wills, who grew up in the 1910s and '20s fiddling in rural Texas with his father, John Wills. They wrote the melody together when Bob was very young; it wasn't until 1950 that the song gained lyrics, courtesy of Bob's younger brother, Billy Jack.&lt;/ref&gt;*[[Mark O'Connor]] is a legendary performer who also plays bluegrass and jazz but got started as a youth contender in fiddle contests.

== New England, "Down East," Yankee, or Boston fiddle ==

One of the most prominent examples of the New England fiddle tradition was Maine's [[Mellie Dunham]], who was a sensation in his day. Today New England fiddle playing is exemplified by [[Rounder Records]] artist Frank Ferrel.&lt;ref&gt;Notable as heard on ''A Prairie Home Companion.'' In the Boston Globe he was referred to  as "one of the finest living masters," of that genre.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the style as "Down East" in his volume ''Boston Fiddle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankferrel.com/ |title=Official Website |publisher=Frank Ferrel |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other fiddle traditions, piano accompaniment is common, and, he notes occasionally saxophone or clarinet would join in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/frank-ferrel/album/boston-fiddle-the-dudley-street-tradition&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature is frequent use of minor keys particularly G minor and also the "flat keys" of F Major and B flat Major, which are not typically used in Old Time and other indigenous music traditions.  Ferrell traces his roots into the 1800s Boston Scottish and Irish cultures as typified in musicians such as William Bradbury Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan's Mammoth Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Like all Celtic American fiddle traditions, his is influenced by the publication of Chief O'Neil's massive directory of fiddle tunes in 1903 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/ireland/index.html |title=Irish Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ferrel and others in the North East tradition use the full panoply of Irish fiddle ornamentation.

Other influences include [[Scottish fiddling]] and Cape Breton style, which has its own blend of Celtic traditions which include also Normandy styles.

==Canadian and other international influence==

American fiddle traditions are deeply influenced by international influence from numerous immigrations and ordinary commerce particularly from Anglo-Celtic and [[Canadian fiddle|Canadian]] sources. Québécois French, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.

Some observers categorize Maritime influence as a cosmopolitan trend of its own blending otherwise distinct styles

== Plot ==
In [[New York City]], Richie ([[Shawn Christensen]]), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill ([[Ron Perlman]]), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.

At his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie ([[Emmy Rossum]]), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia ([[Fátima Ptacek]]). Richie goes to her school, where she recites "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]" by [[Emily Dickinson]] in both English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.

Richie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for [[menopause]]. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.

Richie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon ([[Paul Wesley]]), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.

As a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham ([[Richard Schiff]]), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.

Richie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called "Sophia". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.

After Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren ([[Fran Kranz]]), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.

Having reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.

Maggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a "false idol". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.

'''Blanchet''' is an historic watch brand stated in Switzerland in 1819 by Jean Blanchet.  The current owner of Blanchet is the D Group, that in 2010 relaunched the brand.

==History==
[[Jean Blanchet (watchmaker)|Jean Blanchet]] was a Swiss watchmaker who grew up in France (Lyon) where his father Pierre Blanchet owned a small watch dial factory. Since youth, Jean Blanchet was fascinated by the French and Swiss watches tradition. He launch his own watch manufacturing in 1789. From the first steps his company had a cross-border success all over the old continent.

In 1828 Jean Blanchet married Laura Wilson, the daughter of an English ambassador. One year later she gave birth to their son Yves Blanchet.

In the age of 20 he decided to go to the Royal School of watchmaking (Ecole Royale de l'Horlogerie de [[Cluses]]).

Yves took over the company in 1852, when Jean died during an accident. Four years later he moved close to the Lake of Geneva, in Coppet, to perfection his watchmaking technique and start his own business "Manufacture d'Horologerie Blanchet &amp; Cie".

Jean Blanchet owned some vineyards in Hight Savoye ([[Haute Savoie]]) near [[Geneva]].
He usually used to say "...designing and create a watch is similar to cultivate a vineyard..."

==Famous Blanchet owners==
Among the admirers of Blanchet watches there were some important historical figures.
[[Napoleon III]] commissioned some models as present for French Army officers.

[[British Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] showed his Blanchet timepiece to [[Camillo Benso]], count of Cavour, the leading figure in the movement toward Italian unification.

'''CELINE''' is a [[France|French]] [[ready-to-wear]] and [[leather]] [[luxury goods]] brand that has been owned by [[LVMH]] group since 1996. It was founded in 1945 by Céline Vipiana. Since November 2015, the headquarters are located at 16 rue Vivienne in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]] at the Hôtel Colbert de Torcy, which has [[Monument historique|French Historic Monument classification]].&lt;ref name="The House"&gt;Robert Murphy, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-house-that-celine-built-1427291901 The House That Céline Built] March 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Séverine Merle is the Chief Executive Officer since April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/celine-recruits-next-ceo-plots-online-sales-10816290/|title=Céline Finds Next CEO; Plots Online Sales|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2018, [[LVMH]] announced that [[Hedi Slimane]] will take over at Celine as its artistic, creative and image director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/news/hedi-slimane-named-artistic-creative-and-image-director-of-celine/|title=Hedonism Slimane named Artistic, Creative and Image Director of Céline|website=lvmh.com |date= January 21, 2018 |accessdate= January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the brand==
In 1945, Céline Vipiana (1915–1997)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vogue.it/en/news/encyclo/designers/c/celine&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband, Richard, created one of the first luxury brands in the industry, Céline, a [[made-to-measure]] children's shoe business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/fashion/fashionshows/designers/bios/celine/ Celine] ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and opened a first boutique at 52 rue Malte in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was recognised by its logo, the red elephant created by Raymont Peynet.&lt;ref&gt;vogue.com [http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==A new positioning==
In 1960, the brand decided to change its positioning by focusing its business on a ready-to-wear fashion brand for women with a [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;europa-exclusive.com [http://www.europa-exclusive.com/live/brandinfo.asp-lang=en&amp;brand_id=1884.htm Celine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811145652/http://www.europa-exclusive.com/live/brandinfo.asp-lang%3Den%26brand_id%3D1884.htm |date=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the brand offered a range of leather goods such as bags, [[loafers]], gloves and clothes.&lt;ref&gt;thinkfashion.com [http://www.thinkfashion.com/designer-brands/designer-profiles/celine.aspx Celine Designer Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Céline Vipiana remained the designer from 1945-1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/celine/ Céline] ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the launch of the new [[fragrance]] "Vent fou"&lt;ref&gt;Vogue France, [http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; and the new ‘American Sulky’ collection of accessories gained success. The trench became the chief product of the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the popularity of leather, Céline opened a leather goods factory in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Céline redesigned its [[logo]] with the intertwined "C" Sulky canvas, linked to the Arc-de-Triomphe, which appeared as a symbol for Parisians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Céline began its expansion in the world with the opening of various boutiques in Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahierdexercices.com/fr/celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand’s founders wished to be part of a charitable association, so Richard Vipiana established the Céline-Pasteur Prize, a sponsor for the [[American Hospital of Paris]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Vogue France, [http://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/celine-1/639 Céline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by LVMH==
In 1987, [[Bernard Arnault]] decided to buy into Céline’s capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Celine Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only in 1996 that the brand was integrated into the [[LVMH]] group for 2.7&amp;nbsp;billion [[French francs]] ($540&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DF1439F931A15750C0A960958260 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[LVMH]] propelled the brand to fame with the opening of a boutique at 36 avenue Montaigne in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/celine-ivana-viplana-omazic Celine &amp; Ivana Viplana, Omazic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Céline’s designers ==
American fashion designer [[Michael Kors]] was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for Céline in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aboutus.michaelkors.com/bio.php Michael Kors Official biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607064539/http://aboutus.michaelkors.com/bio.php |date=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure at Céline, Kors brought modern femininity with a luxurious spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2004RTW-CELINE Fall 2004 Ready-to-Wear Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he left the fashion luxury house to focus his career on his own brand.

In 2005, [[Italian people|Italian]] designer Roberto Menichetti was named creative director.

A year later, [[Croats|Croatian]] designer Ivana Omazic directed the design studio. Omazic was a former consultant for the brand and previously worked with Romeo Gigli, [[Prada]], [[Jil Sander]] and Miu Miu. Omazic designed for Céline until 2008, after further disappointments for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/runway/2008/10/02/celines-ivana-omazic-takes-final-bow/ Céline's Ivana Omazic takes final bow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phoebe Philo: a Decade as Creative Director==
On September 4, 2008, the fashion portal ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' announced that [[Bernard Arnault]], president of [[LVMH]], had appointed [[Phoebe Philo]] as the new creative director of Céline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/celine-taps-phoebe-philo-1735699 Céline taps Phoebe Philo]&lt;/ref&gt; Philo's tenure at Céline began in October 2008, and she presented her first ready-to-wear collection for Spring/Summer 2010 at [[Paris Fashion Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/2010RST-CELINE Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive officer of LVMH’s fashion division, said that recruiting Philo was giving her the opportunity to express her vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionunited.com/news/leads/celine-appoints-phoebe-philo-as-creative-director-200804090980 Céline appoints Phoebe Philo as creative director]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, Vogue Magazine defined her style as the “cool minimal trend”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/featured-designer-celine/story-fnivsvxg-1226742360965 Featured designer: Celine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philo studied at [[Central Saint Martins]] School of Art and Design in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levelshoedistrict.com/designers/celine Designer: Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Céline,  Philo held the position of Design Director at [[Chloé]].

In 2010, Philo received the Designer of the Year award from [[British Fashion Council]]. In 2011, she was awarded International Designer of the Year by the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdclifestyle.com/posts/2012/11/01/phoebe-philo-the-mastermind-behind-the-transformation-of-celine-by-caroline-stanbury/ Phoebe Philo the mastermind behind the transformation of Céline]&lt;/ref&gt; Both prizes were awarded for her work at Céline.

In December 2017, Philo announced her departure from Céline after finishing the Fall 2018 collection, which is to presented in March of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/exclusive-phoebe-philo-to-leave-celine-11081454/|title=Phoebe Philo to Leave Céline|last=|first=|date=December 22, 2017|work=WWD|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hedi Slimane ==
On January 21, 2018, LVMH announced the appointment of [[Hedi Slimane]] as ''Artistic, Creative and Image Director'', set to join the house on February 1. He is to direct all Céline collections, extending the brand's offering with the launch of men’s fashion, couture and fragrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180121005117/en/|title=Hedi Slimane Named Artistic, Creative and Image Director of Céline|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2018|work=BusinessWire|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, Slimane presented an updated Celine logo on the brand's Instagram account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/celine-new-logo|title=Céline Unveils A New Logo|last=Pithers|first=Ellie|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90231578/celines-new-logo-is-tearing-fashion-fans-apart|title=Fashion’s branding crisis|date=2018-09-06|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dakota Johnson]] was the first celebrity to wear Slimane’s first Celine collection on the red carpet for the [[Los Angeles]] premiere of [[Suspiria (2018 film)| Suspiria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/dakota-johnson-wears-celine-by-hedi-slimane|title=Dakota Johnson Is The First To Wear Celine By Hedi Slimane On The Red Carpet|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl "Charlie" Brandt''' (February 23, 1957 &amp;ndash; September 13, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. A former resident of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] and longtime resident of the [[Florida Keys]], Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa "Teri" Brandt, and [[decapitation|decapitated]] and severely mutilated his [[niece]], Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.

It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents &amp;ndash; his pregnant mother fatally &amp;ndash; in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with [[human anatomy]], investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.

== Early life ==
Brandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two [[German people|German]] immigrants who originally lived in [[Connecticut]]. His father worked as a laborer for a division of [[International Harvester]], eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in [[Florida]], where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.

== 1971 incident ==
On the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, "Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad." Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=3 Deadly Obsession] Page 3, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a [[grand jury]] and was ordered to undergo three separate [[psychiatric evaluation]]s, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, "Basically, I was looking for [[mental illness]]. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know." Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=4 Deadly Obsession] Page 4, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.

== 2004 incident ==
Shortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of [[Big Pine Key]], the southernmost portion of the [[Florida Keys]], in 1989. 

On September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=2 Deadly Obsession] Page 2, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlj-foundation.org/history.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051320/http://mlj-foundation.org/history.html# |date=2013-10-21 }}, Michelle Lynn Jones Foundation. Retrieved 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been [[decapitation|decapitated]] and [[disembowelment|disemboweled]], with her [[human heart|heart]] and [[human organs|organs]] removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ 7 News Investigations: Killer Connection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109150114/http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ |date=January 9, 2011 }}, WSVN-TV, 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.

== Investigation ==
A search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to [[Victoria's Secret]] [[Trade literature|catalog]]s; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and [[snuff film]] websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked [[cold case]]s in Florida that matched his apparent ''[[modus operandi]]'', and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad. Ultimately, the search linked Brandt to twenty-six unsolved murders in Florida dating back to 1973.

* '''Carol Sullivan, 1978:''' Sullivan, aged 12, was abducted from a school bus stop in [[Volusia County]] on September 20, 1978. Her skull was found inside a bucket, leading authorities to presume she was murdered and decapitated. Brandt was 20 years old and lived in Volusia County at the time, but could not be tied to the crime in any other way. 
* '''Lisa Saunders, 1988:''' Saunders, aged 20, was beaten, stabbed, and dragged from her car in Big Pine Key in December 1988. Her heart was missing when she was found, but it is unclear if it was extracted by an attacker or eaten by vultures. 
* '''Sherry Perisho, 1989:''' Perisho's partially-clothed body was found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a [[dinghy]]. Her throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was extensively mutilated and her heart was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt matched a [[composite sketch]] of a man seen crossing [[U.S. Route 1]] near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-06/news/MBRANDT06_1_brandt-monroe-county-seminole Killer tied to '89 death -- wife suspected him all along], ''The Orlando Sentinel'', 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Darlene Toler, 1995:''' Toler was a [[prostitute]] from [[Miami]] whose body, missing her head and heart, was found near a highway wrapped in plastic. Brandt used the same highway regularly and he kept a mileage record of his travels, which shows an entry for 100 miles {{ndash}} the driving distance between Big Pine Key and Miami {{ndash}} on the day of her murder.

[[Image:Plastic comb, 2015-06-07.jpg|thumb|A modern plastic comb]]

A '''comb''' is a tool consisting of a shaft, usually wider than it is long, that holds a row of teeth for pulling through  the [[hair]] to clean, untangle, or style it.  Combs have been used since [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, having been discovered in very refined forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IIOAAAAQAAJ|title=Nineveh and Persepolis: An Historical Sketch of Ancient Assyria and Persia, with an Account of the Recent Researches in Those Countries|last=Vaux|first=William Sandys Wright|date=1850-01-01|publisher=A.

==Description==
[[File:Local artisan cutting and filing animal horn to make combs.webm|thumb|Local artisan cutting and filing animal horn to make combs in [[Alappuzha]], [[Kerala]]]]

Combs consist of a shaft and teeth that are placed at a perpendicular angle to the shaft.  Combs can be made out of a number of materials, most commonly [[plastic]], metal or [[wood]]. Combs made from [[ivory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4DaHyIC3DeEC|title = Archaeology and Environment in the Scoresby Sund Fjord|last = Sandell|first = Hanne Tuborg|last2 = Sandell|first2 = Birger|date = 1991-01-01|publisher = Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn = 9788763512084|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tortoiseshell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=-rHmq8CXIMwC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=comb+tortoise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o4Gkta_LAhWkxIMKHdopBhcQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=comb%2520tortoise&amp;f=false|title = American Artifacts of Personal Adornment, 1680-1820: A Guide to Identification and Interpretation|last = White|first = Carolyn L.|date = 2005-01-01|publisher = Rowman Altamira|isbn = 9780759105898|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once common but concerns for the animals that produce them have reduced their usage.  When made from wood, combs are largely made of [[boxwood (genus)|boxwood]], cherry wood or other fine-grained wood. Good quality wooden combs are usually handmade and polished.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC|title = Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|last = Sherrow|first = Victoria|date = 2006-01-01|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn = 9780313331459|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs come in various [[shapes]] and sizes depending on what they are used for. A hairdressing comb may have a thin, tapered handle for parting hair and close teeth. Common hair combs usually have wider teeth halfway and finer teeth for the rest of the comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AcDmHwcv4jMC|title = The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland: C.AD 400 - 1200|last = Laing|first = Lloyd Robert|date = 2006-06-29|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521838627|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot combs were used solely for straightening hair during the colonial era in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IFKNL65TwcEC|title = Interpreting Archaeology: Finding Meaning in the Past|last = Hodder|first = Ian|date = 1997-01-01|publisher = Psychology Press|isbn = 9780415157445|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hairbrush]] comes in both manual and electric models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YygDAAAAMBAJ|title = Popular Science|last = Corporation|first = Bonnier|date = 1937-09-01|publisher = Bonnier Corporation|page = 39|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is larger than a comb, and is also commonly used for shaping, styling and cleaning hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ve9NAAAAYAAJ|title = The Toilet and Cosmetic Arts in Ancient and Modern Times|last = Cooley|first = Arnold James|date = 1866-01-01|publisher = R.

== Uses and types ==
[[File:Schurig Woman combing her hair.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Woman combing her hair'' by [[Felix Schurig]], 1870]]

Combs can be used for many purposes. Historically, their main purpose was securing long hair in place, decorating the hair, matting sections of hair for [[dreadlocks]], or keeping a [[kippah]] or skullcap in place. In Spain, a ''[[Peineta (comb)|peineta]]'' is a large decorative comb used to keep a [[mantilla]] in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UxxwAwAAQBAJ|title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language with Families of Words based on Indo-European Roots: Volume II (H - Z and Appendix)|last = Roberts|first = Edward A.|date = 2014-04-10|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|isbn = 9781493191116|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In industry and craft, combs are used in separating cotton fibres from seeds and other debris (the [[cotton gin]], a mechanized version of the comb, is one of the machines that ushered in the [[Industrial Revolution]]). A comb is used to distribute colors in [[paper marbling]] to make the swirling colour patterns in comb-marbled paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kY92BMFNFjUC|title = Marbled Paper: Its History, Techniques, and Patterns : with Special Reference to the Relationship of Marbling to Bookbinding in Europe and the Western World|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|date = 1990-01-01|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn = 0812281888|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs are also a favorite tool for [[police]] investigators to collect hair and dandruff samples that can be used in ascertaining dead or living persons' identities, as well as their state of health, toxicological profiles, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZY0AAAAIAAJ|title = Practical Instruction in Police Work and Detective Science: A Course of Instruction ...

===Making music===
Stringing a plant's leaf or a piece of paper over one side of the comb and humming with cropped lips on the opposite side dramatically increases the high-frequency harmonic content of the hum produced by the human voice box, and the resulting spread sound spectrum can be modulated by changing the resonating frequency of the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVrIoX5kQt8C|title = The Everything Lawn Care Book: From Seed to Soil, Mowing to Fertilizing--hundreds of Tips for Growing a Beautiful Lawn|last = Green|first = Douglas|date = 2001-01-01|publisher = Adams Media|isbn = 1580624871|page = 23|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the inspiration for the [[kazoo]], a [[membranophone]].  Moreover, the comb is also a [[lamellophone]]. Comb teeth have [[harmonic]] qualities of their own, determined by their shape, length, and material. A comb with teeth of unequal length, capable of producing different notes when picked, eventually evolved into the [[thumb piano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4CeFAC5MdxwC|title = The Cambridge History of American Music|last = Nicholls|first = David|date = 1998-11-19|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521454292|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[musical box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ckw5AQAAIAAJ|title = Cylinder musical box technology: including makers, types, dating, and music|last = Bulleid|first = Henry Anthony Vaughan|date = 1994-09-25|publisher = Almar Press|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afro pick===
[[File:Handmade African 'Afro' Combs.png|thumb|Afro picks]]
This type of comb has loose, thick teeth and is usually used on kinky or [[Afro-textured hair]]. It is longer and thinner than the typical comb, and it is sometimes worn in the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GDoVCwAAQBAJ|title = Fashion Fads Through American History: Fitting Clothes into Context: Fitting Clothes into Context|last = Moore|first = Jennifer Grayer|date = 2015-12-14|publisher = ABC-CLIO|isbn = 9781610699020|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xFsDAAAAMBAJ|title = Jet|last = Company|first = Johnson Publishing|date = 1972-02-17|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afro picks were common in many melanesian and polynesian societies but were usually an adornment and worn on ceremonial occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/tribal-comb/|title=Tribal Comb {{!}} Tribal hair Comb {{!}} Pacific Island Tribal Comb|date=2018-04-17|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nit comb===
[[File:HMB Läusekamm Jungsteinzeit.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Stone Age]] [[Head louse|nit]] comb]]
Specialized combs such as "[[flea]] combs" or "[[head louse|nit]] combs" can be used to remove [[macroscopic]] [[parasite]]s and cause them damage by combing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=8-lJ0tQazlcC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;dq=nit+comb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFwviWsq_LAhUCmoMKHRyLBLkQ6AEINDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nit%2520comb&amp;f=false|title = The Lice-Buster Book: What to Do When Your Child Comes Home with Head Lice|last = Copeland|first = Lennie|date = 2001-10-01|publisher = Grand Central Publishing|isbn = 9780759526297|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comb with teeth fine enough to remove nits is sometimes called a "fine-toothed comb", as in the [[metaphor]]ic usage "go over [something] with a fine-toothed comb", meaning  to search closely and in detail. Sometimes in this meaning, "fine-toothed comb" has been reanalysed as "fine toothcomb" and then shortened to "toothcomb", or changed into forms such as "the finest of toothcombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/toothcomb.html |title=WSU.edu |publisher=WSU.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morewitz, H.|date=2008|title=A Brief History of Lice Combs|url=http://nuvoforheadlice.com/lice_combs.htm |website=Nuvoforheadlice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene===
Sharing combs is a common cause of [[parasite|parasitic]] infections much like sharing a hat, as one user can leave a comb with eggs or live parasites, facilitating the transmission of [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, [[mite]]s, [[fungi]], and other undesirables. Siblings are also more likely to pass on nits to each other if they share a comb, so it is advisable to buy each child their own comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5Y_sA6A83wC|title = All You Wanted To Know About Hair Care|last = Sinha|first = Meenakshi|last2 = Rajgopal|first2 = Reena|last3 = Banerjee|first3 = Suchismita|date = 2012-06-01|publisher = Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn = 9788120791022|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unbreakable plastic comb===

An unbreakable plastic comb is a comb that, despite being made of plastic rather than (more expensive) metal, does not shatter into multiple pieces if dropped on a hard surface such as bathroom tiles, a hardwood floor, or pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yO3HbKLNx5EC|title = A Likely Story|last = Adams|first = Glenn Arthur|date = 2000-06-09|publisher = iUniverse|isbn = 9780595004294|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such combs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=-2UhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=unbreakable+plastic+comb&amp;dq=unbreakable+plastic+comb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl8IPtsq_LAhWrm4MKHSENA-wQ6AEIQzAF|title = Home Affairs Survey|last = Division|first = Great Britain Central Office of Information Reference|date = 1951-01-01|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today most plastic combs are unbreakable as technology has reached a point of understanding the causation of brittleness in these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RJWiilJLdxYC|title = Characterization and Failure Analysis of Plastics|last = International|first = A.

=== Modern artisan combs ===
Modern artisan combs crafted from a wide variety of new and recycled materials have become popular over recent years. Used skateboard decks, vinyl records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tame-your-hipster-beard-with-a-comb-made-from-what/|title=Tame your hipster beard with a comb made from what?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[brass]], titanium alloy, acrylic and exotic wood are a few of the materials being used.

'''Contractor rating systems''', also known as contractor prequalifications, are one of the larger cost saving practices available and more routinely applied by governmental organizations as a means of avoiding the high cost and inflated pricing that results from reduced competition on public work by using [[surety bond|bonding]] and [[surety]] to guarantee performance of public work.

Years ago [[public purchasing officials]] began applying prequalification and short-listing of pre-selected contractors for bidding on public [[procurement]] contracts. A [[Subjectivity|subjective]] process are in many places the exclusive means of getting on a [[bidding|bidders]] list for public contract work.

These ratings and processes now make the whole issue of bonding and surety, (that has been around since the late 19th century to guarantee of performance and paying large [[insurance premium|premiums]]), obsolete and redundant since the public officials have already reduced risks and are paying premiums associated with reducing competition by using the prequalification process and rating systems.

{{italic title}}
'''''Dick Barton – Special Agent''''' was a popular [[radio drama|radio]] thriller serial broadcast in the [[BBC Light Programme]] between 7 October 1946 and 30 March 1951. Produced and directed by [[Raymond Raikes]], Neil Tuson, and Charles Lefaux, it was aired in 15-minute episodes at 6.45 (later 6.15) each weekday evening. From 11 January 1947 an additional "omnibus" edition repeated all of the week's programmes each Saturday morning between 11.00 and 12.00. In all, 711 episodes were produced and the serial achieved a peak audience of 15 million.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;James Chapman (2006) ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'' Vol. 26, No. 4, pp. 537–559 "‘HONEST BRITISH VIOLENCE’: CRITICAL RESPONSES TO DICK BARTON—SPECIAL AGENT (1946–1951)"&lt;/ref&gt;  Its end was marked by a leading article in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''The Times'', 31 March 1951, p. 7 "The Last Instalment"&lt;/ref&gt;

The serial followed the adventures of ex-[[British Commandos|Commando]] Captain Richard Barton [[Military Cross|MC]] ([[Noel Johnson]], later [[Duncan Carse]] and Gordon Davies) who, with his mates Jock Anderson ([[Alex McCrindle]]) and Snowy White ([[John Mann (British actor)|John Mann]]), solved all sorts of crimes, escaped from dangerous situations, and saved the nation from disaster time and again.

The series was replaced from time to time by one about the adventures of an explorer.  One episode was titled "Plague on the Plateau".

Beginning in 1948, the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] film company made three ''Dick Barton'' films and, long after the radio series had been replaced by ''[[The Archers]]'', [[Southern Television]] made a television version in 1979. ''Dick Barton'' has also been adapted into a tongue-in-cheek stage play and a spoof radio comedy. Each version has featured the original's memorable signature tune, ''[[Devil's Galop]]'' by [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]].

==Radio series==

===Style===
The series was devised by producer [[Norman Collins]]. The scripts were written by [[Edward J. Mason]] and Geoffrey Webb. The programme gave rise to a popular catchphrase of the late 1940s "With one bound Dick was free!" which made light of the fact that no matter how dangerous the cliffhanging situation Dick found himself in every evening, he would always escape easily.

Early ideas for the character's name included "Bill Barton" and "Rex Drake". However, the production team finally settled on the more dynamic Dick Barton. After the series had been on the air for some time, the BBC (conscious that the biggest audience for the programme was schoolboys)  wrote a strict code of what Dick and his chums could and couldn't do, one clause famously stating "Sex plays no part in his adventures."

===Cast===

*[[Noel Johnson]] as Dick Barton
*[[John Mann (British actor)|John Mann]] as Snowey White
*[[William Fox (actor)|William Fox]] as Colonel Gardiner
*[[Alex McCrindle]] as Jock Anderson
*[[Margaret Robertson (actress)|Margaret Robertson]] as Jean Hunter

===Cancellation===
In 1951 ''[[The Archers]]'' was first broadcast at 11.45 am on the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]]. BBC management, led by drama head [[Val Gielgud]], had never felt comfortable with the sensationalism of ''Dick Barton''. ''The Archers'', which they considered more 'suitable', took ''Dick Barton'''s place in the schedules from Easter 1951. 

===Revivals===
In 1972 as part of the BBC's Golden Jubilee, the BBC broadcast a new, abridged, 10 episode version of the first Barton serial - "The Secret Weapon". The cast included many members of the original cast, including Noel Johnson, John Mann, William Fox, Alex McCrindle, and Margaret Robertson.&lt;ref name=Chapman/&gt;

From October 1997 to May 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-part sequel/pastiche called ''Richard Barton: General Practitioner!'', in which Dick Barton's son Richard is a country doctor caring for his apparently senile father, who retreats into fantasies based on his past adventures, believing that there are devilish enemies lurking around him. The series was written by Edward Mason's son Lol Mason, and featured [[Moray Watson]] as old Dick Barton, [[Robert Bathurst]] as his son Richard, [[Matilda Ziegler]] as Richard's wife Sally, [[Julian Dutton]] as young Dick Barton and [[Iain Cuthbertson]] as Jock Anderson. The series was rebroadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05nxw2c&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BBC Audiobooks released ''Dick Barton and the Mystery of the Missing Formula'' ({{ISBN|978-1408410523}}), a reading of a novel based on the radio serials written by [[Mike Dorrell]] and read by [[Toby Stephens]].

The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy.

==Films==
Beginning in 1948, the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] film company made three Dick Barton films, which were intended to be the beginning of a long-running series. [[Don Stannard]], the star, was killed in a car crash in 1949, and Hammer decided to discontinue the series after the production of only three films. Hammer shelved plans to film the next Dick Barton film, ''Dick Barton in Africa'' written by [[John Gilling]].&lt;ref&gt;p.59 Hearn, Marcus &amp; Barnes, Alan ''The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films'' 1997 Titan Books&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Dick Barton: Special Agent]]'' (1948)
* ''[[Dick Barton Strikes Back]]'' (1949)
* ''[[Dick Barton at Bay]]'' (1950)

==Television==
In 1979, [[Southern Television]], one of the smaller [[ITV (TV network)|ITV Network Companies]], made a series of ''Dick Barton - Special Agent'' which ran in an early evening slot on the ITV Network.

Like the original, it ran in 15 minute segments and was again accompanied by the iconic theme tune, the titles playing against an animated dagger and target motif. The production was blighted by financial troubles, though, and some critics said it was a mistake to try to resurrect the character.

The cast of the show were [[Tony Vogel]] as Dick Barton, [[Anthony Heaton]] as Snowey White, [[James Cosmo]] as Jock Anderson and John Gatrell as Sir Richard Marley. The 32x15 minutes episodes were transmitted by most of the ITV network on Saturdays and Sundays between January and April 1979. Southern, however, screened the show across consecutive nights from Mondays through to Thursday in the radio series' original timeslot of 6.45 to 7.00pm.

* Adventure One written by [[Clive Exton]], in ten parts. Demobbed after six years in the army, old friend Sir Richard Marley asks Barton  to look into the disappearance of his daughter Virginia ([[Fiona Fullerton]]) and son Rex ([[Kevan Sheehan]]). They come up against master criminal, Melganik played by [[John G Heller]].
* Adventure Two written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. At a late night celebration at the "Blue Parrot", Barton and his colleagues rescue a young girl, Lucy Cameron ([[Debbie Farrington]]) from being attacked. She tells them that her father, George Cameron ([[Colin Rix]]) has been kidnapped by the evil Muller ([[Guy Deghy]]) who is after the deadly poison he has developed.
* Adventure Three written by Clive Exton, in six parts. Celebrating from the last adventure, Dick's Aunt Agatha ([[Stella Kemball]]) rings up and tells him that her house has vanished. A further phone call from Sir Richard Marley reveals that scientist, Harold Jenkins ([[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]]) has perfected his ultimate weapon and Barton and comrades soon find themselves up against Melganik again.
* Adventure Four written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. Dandy Parkes ([[Terence Seward]]), a middle-aged playboy and Amanda Aston ([[Marsha Fitzalan]]), wife of a respected Whitehall official are threatened by the Drew Brothers (Ernie Drew by [[Bernard Kay]]).

The complete series was released on DVD in March 2009, and in 2010 reruns of ''Dick Barton'' were shown on the British satellite television channel [[Film 24 (channel)|Film 24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film24.com]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 it had reappeared on another satellite channel, [[Talking Pictures TV]]. Rumours have suggested that a revival starring actor [[Nigel Havers]] was being planned, but to date this has come to nothing.

==Stage musical==
A stage musical, ''Dick Barton Episode I, Special Agent'', written by [[Phil Willmott]], directed by [[Ted Craig]]. Musical direction was by Stefan Bednarczyk. It premièred at the [[Warehouse Theatre]] in December 1998 to great acclaim. It was revived in 1999 and productions then toured Britain between 1998 and 2001. Following its success, further "episodes" were written and performed at the [[Warehouse Theatre]]:

==CD Releases==

The BBC's 1972 remake of the very first Dick Barton serial has been available to buy on BBC CD and tape for many years. For some time, this was the only Dick Barton radio material that was commercially available, having been recovered from a recording made by a member of the public. However, this has now changed.

In February 2011, BBC Radio 4 and a number of national newspapers reported that 338 episodes of Dick Barton recorded in the late 1940s had been recovered from the NFSA [National Film and Sound Archive] in Australia; these re-recordings, using the original BBC scripts and music cues, starred Douglas Kelly as Barton with Moira Carleton, Clifford Cowley, Richard Davies, William Lloyd and Patricia Kennedy. BBC Worldwide's audio arm have released a number of these on CD.

The Dick Barton radio series was later relaunched in the UK on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] (formerly [[BBC Radio 7]]) and further Dick Barton CDs have been announced by AudioGO (using the NFSA recordings).

The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy.

This new live production of the 1951 Barton story 'Dick Barton and the Trail of the Rocket' was recorded at the Y Theatre in Leicester using original scripts from 1951. It was released on CD by BBC Audio in July 2014, along with a number of bonus features. It is the only recording of this final Dick Barton serial to be made available by the BBC on CD. The original 1951 recording was never archived. It was billed as 'Dick Barton - Special Agent: LIVE' and starred Tim Bentinck in the lead.

==Plot summary==
{{plot|date=November 2016}}
===Die Nibelungen: Siegfried===

[[Image:nibelungen film1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Siegfried with Alberich the dwarf.]]The title character [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], son of King Siegmund of Xanten, masters the art of forging a sword at the shop of Mime. Siegfried hears the tales of the kingdom of Burgundy, the kings who rule there, as well as of [[Kriemhild]], the princess of Burgundy. Siegfried announces he wants to win her hand in marriage, much to the amusement of the smiths. Siegfried demands to be told the way. Mime, who is envious of Siegfried's skill as a swordsmith, claims there is a shortcut to Burgundy through the Wood of Woden, wherein dwell all kinds of dangerous creatures. Siegfried encounters a [[dragon]], and deviates from his path to slay it. He touches its hot, yellow blood and suddenly understands the language of the birds, who instruct him to bathe in the dragon's blood in order to become invincible  — except for one spot on his shoulder blade, covered by a falling lime (linden) leaf.

Soon after, the powerful Siegfried trespasses on the land of the Nibelungs and is attacked by [[Alberich]], King of the [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarves]], who has turned himself invisible. Siegfried defeats Alberich, who offers Siegfried a net of invisibility and transformation if he spares his life, whereupon Alberich offers to make Siegfried "the richest king on earth!" [intertitle 1.14]. While Siegfried is mesmerized by the treasure and the sword Balmung, Alberich tries to defeat him, but dies in the attempt. Dying, Alberich curses all inheritors of the treasure and he and his dwarves turn to stone.

Siegfried finally arrives in Burgundy in his new guise as King of twelve kingdoms. A fight breaks out between Siegfried and King Gunther and his adviser [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen of Tronje]], which is interrupted by the appearance of beautiful princess Kriemhild. Hagen asks Siegfried to aid Kriemhild's brother, [[Gunther|King Gunther]], to win the hand of [[Brunhild]], the Queen of Iceland. The men travel to Brunhild's kingdom, where Siegfried feigns vassalage to Gunther so that he can avoid Brunhild's challenge and instead use the net's power of invisibility to help Gunther beat the powerful Queen in a threefold battle of strength. The men return to Burgundy where Gunther marries Brunhild and Siegfried weds Kriemhild.

Brunhild is not, however, completely defeated. She suspects deceit and refuses to consummate the marriage. Hagen again convinces Siegfried to help. Siegfried transforms himself into Gunther and battles Brunhild and removes her arm-ring during battle, after which she submits to his will. Siegfried leaves the real Gunther to consummate the marriage.

Kriemhild discovers Brunhild's armlet and asks Siegfried about it. Siegfried discloses the truth to Kriemhild about his role in Brunhild's defeat. When the Nibelungen treasure that Siegfried acquired from Alberich arrives at the court of Burgundy as Kriemhild's wedding gift, Brunhild becomes more suspicious about Siegfried's feigned vassalage to Gunther. Brunhild dons the Queen Mother's jewellery and proceeds to the cathedral to enter as the first person, as is her right as Queen of Burgundy. Kriemhild tries to take Brunhild's right of way and an argument erupts between the two Queens. Kriemhild betrays her husband's and brother's secret to Brunhild, who then confronts Gunther.

Brunhild demands that Siegfried must be killed, which she justifies by claiming that Siegfried stole her maidenhood [intertitle 1.94] when he struggled with her on her wedding night. Hagen von Tronje and King Gunther conspire to murder Siegfried during a hunt in the Odenwald. Hagen deceives Kriemhild into divulging Siegfried's weak spot by sewing a cross on the spot in Siegfried's tunic.

After the hunt, Hagen challenges Siegfried to a race to a nearby spring. When Siegfried is on his knees drinking, Hagen pierces him from behind with a spear.

In an evil twist of bitter revenge, Brunhild confesses that she lied about Siegfried stealing her maidenhood in order to avenge Gunther's deceit of her.

Kriemhild demands her family avenge her husband's death at the hands of Hagen, but her family is complicit in the murder, and so they protect Hagen. Kriemhild swears revenge against Hagen while Brunhild commits suicide at the foot of Siegfried's corpse, which has been laid in state in the cathedral.

[[Image:nibelungen film2.jpg|thumbnail|none|400px|A transformation sequence from ''Die Nibelungen: Siegfried'': After Siegfried's death, Kriemhild has a vision of Siegfried's last farewell to her.]]

===Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (Kriemhild's Revenge)===

Kriemhild tries to win over the people of Burgundy to help her exact revenge against Hagen, to whom her brothers have sworn allegiance. Kriemhild bribes the people with money and treasure from the Nibelungen hoard. Margrave Rüdiger of Bechlarn arrives unannounced to woo Kriemhild on behalf of his King, King [[Attila|Etzel]], who resides in the land of the Huns. Kriemhild initially declines, but ultimately she recognises the opportunity for revenge in her marriage with Etzel and in Rüdiger's allegiance to her. She forces Rüdiger to swear allegiance to her on his sword. At that very moment, news arrives that Hagen has stolen her wedding gift, the Nibelungen hoard, which Hagen has, unbeknownst to all, sunk into the Rhine river.

Kriemhild travels to Etzel's lands and accepts his hand. As a gift to Kriemhild for bearing him a son, Ortlieb, Etzel grants her a wish. Kriemhild requests Etzel to invite her family to celebrate the Midsummer Solstice with them in the Hun kingdom. In the meantime, Kriemhild bribes Etzel's Hun warriors with money and treasure to avenge her and attack Hagen.

When the Burgundians arrive, the Huns launch several unsuccessful attempts. Instead, the Huns  launch an attack on the Burgundian soldiers during their feast in the subterranean caves where the Huns reside. The Burgundian Knight Dankwart manages to escape the melee and warns the Burgundian kings who are feasting with Etzel and Kriemhild in Etzel's palace. Upon hearing of the treacherous attack, Hagen of Tronje murders Etzel's son, and battle breaks out. Dietrich of Bern manages to negotiate an exit from the hall for Etzel's royal entourage, which leaves the Burgundian guests imprisoned in Etzel's palace.

The remaining 45 minutes of the film consists of multiple battles in which the Huns launch multiple attacks on the Burgundians. Kriemhild offers her family freedom if they surrender Hagen to her. They decline. Ultimately Kriemhild calls upon Rüdiger to fulfill his oath of allegiance by attacking Hagen. Rüdiger refuses, but is forced to by Etzel. At the beginning of the battle, Rüdiger is killed by [[Volker von Alzey|Volker of Alzey]] after Rüdiger of Bechlarn himself smote his nearly son-in-law Giselher of Burgundy with his sword. Gerenot carries his dead brother outside the hall to show his sister what she has done with her vindictiveness. Kriemhild grieves for Giselher and begs Gerenot for a last time to surrender Hagen of Tronje to her, but he refuses again and so is killed by the Huns. In a final act of desperation, Kriemhild commands the palace be set alight.

As the flames smoulder, only Gunther and Hagen survive. Dietrich of Bern fetches the two remaining men from the palace and delivers them to Kriemhild, who demands Hagen to reveal the hiding place of the Nibelungen hoard. When Hagen states that he has sworn not to reveal the hiding place as long as one of his kings is still alive, Kriemhild commands Gunther's beheading. When Hagen reveals that no one now knows the location of the treasure apart from him and God, and that God will never tell more than he does, Kriemhild grabs Siegfried's sword from Hagen and cuts him down. Infuriated by Kriemhild's act of murder, Sword Master Hildebrandt stabs Kriemhild from behind.

Etzel's final words are that Kriemhild should be taken back home to her dead husband, Siegfried, because she never belonged to any other man [intertitle 2.159].

[[Image:dielectric elastomers.gif|thumb|right|300px|Working principle of dielectric elastomer actuators. An elastomeric film is coated on both sides with electrodes. The electrodes are connected to a circuit. By applying a voltage &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the electrostatic pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{el}&lt;/math&gt; acts. Due to the mechanical compression the elastomer film contracts in the thickness direction and expands in the film plane directions. The elastomer film moves back to its original position when it is short-circuited.]]

'''Dielectric elastomers''' ('''DEs''') are [[smart material]] systems that produce large [[Strain (materials science)|strains]]. They belong to the group of [[electroactive polymers]] (EAP). DE actuators (DEA) transform electric energy into mechanical work. They are lightweight and have a high elastic energy density. They have been investigated since the late 1990s. Many prototype applications exist. Every year, conferences are held in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spie.org/app/program/index.cfm?fuseaction=conferencedetail&amp;export_id=x12536&amp;ID=x12233&amp;redir=x12233.xml&amp;conference_id=1040757&amp;event_id=997497 |title=Conference Detail for Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices (EAPAD) XV |publisher=Spie.org |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}{{Registration required|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroeap.eu/conference European conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working principles ==

A DEA is a compliant [[capacitor]] (see image), where a passive [[elastomer]] film is sandwiched between two compliant [[electrode]]s. When a [[voltage]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is applied, the [[electrostatic]] pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{el}&lt;/math&gt; arising from the Coulomb forces acts between the electrodes. The electrodes squeeze the elastomer film. The equivalent electromechanical pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; is twice the electrostatic pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{el}&lt;/math&gt; and is given by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_{eq}=\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r\frac{U^2}{z^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dielectric constant]] of the [[polymer]] and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the elastomer film. Usually, strains of DEA are in the order of 10–35%, maximum values reach 300% (the acrylic elastomer VHB 4910, commercially available from [[3M]], which also sports a high elastic energy density and a high [[electrical breakdown]] strength.)

=== Ionic ===

Replacing the electrodes with soft [[hydrogels]] allows ionic transport to replace electron transport. Aqueous ionic hydrogels can deliver potentials of multiple kilovolts, despite the onset of electrolysis at below 1.5 V.&lt;ref name=sci1307&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1240228| title = Stretchable, Transparent, Ionic Conductors| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6149| pages = 984–7| year = 2013| last1 = Keplinger | first1 = C.| last2 = Sun | first2 = J. -Y. | last3 = Foo | first3 = C. C.| last4 = Rothemund | first4 = P.| last5 = Whitesides | first5 = G. M.| last6 = Suo | first6 = Z. | pmid=23990555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sci1308&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = J. A. | title = A Clear Advance in Soft Actuators | doi = 10.1126/science.1243314 | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6149 | pages = 968–969 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23990550| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the capacitance of the double layer and the dielectric leads to a potential across the dielectric that can be millions of times greater than that across the double layer. Potentials in the kilovolt range can be realized without electrochemically degrading the hydrogel.&lt;ref name=sci1307/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

Deformations are well controlled, reversible, and capable of high-frequency operation. The resulting devices can be perfectly transparent. High-frequency actuation is possible. Switching speeds are limited only by mechanical inertia. The hydrogel's stiffness can be thousands of times smaller than the dielectric's, allowing actuation without mechanical constraint across a range of nearly 100% at millisecond speeds. They can be biocompatible.&lt;ref name=sci1307/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

Remaining issues include drying of the hydrogels, ionic build-up, hysteresis, and electrical shorting.&lt;ref name=sci1307/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

Early experiments in semiconductor device research relied on ionic conductors to investigate field modulation of contact potentials in silicon and to enable the first solid-state amplifiers. Work since 2000 has established the utility of electrolyte gate electrodes. Ionic gels can also serve as elements of high-performance, stretchable graphene transistors.&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

== Materials ==

Films of carbon powder or grease loaded with [[carbon black]] were early choices as electrodes for the DEAs. Such materials have poor reliability and are not available with established manufacturing techniques. Improved characteristics can be achieved with liquid metal, sheets of [[graphene]], coatings of carbon nanotubes, surface-implanted layers of metallic nanoclusters and corrugated or patterned metal films.&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Yang|last2=Gao|first2=Meng|last3=Mei|first3=Shengfu|last4=Han|first4=Yanting|last5=Liu|first5=Jing|title=Ultra-compliant liquid metal electrodes with in-plane self-healing capability for dielectric elastomer actuators|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=2013|volume=103|issue=6|pages=064101|doi=10.1063/1.4817977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These options offer limited mechanical properties, sheet resistances, switching times and easy integration. [[Silicone]]s and [[acryl group|acrylic]] elastomers are other alternatives.

The requirements for an elastomer material are:

* The material should have low [[stiffness]] (especially when large strains are required);
* The [[dielectric constant]] should be high;
* The [[electrical breakdown]] strength should be high.

Mechanically prestretching the elastomer film offers the possibility of enhancing the electrical breakdown strength. Further reasons for prestretching include:

* Film thickness decreases, requiring a lower voltage to obtain the same electrostatic pressure;
* Avoiding compressive stresses in the film plane directions.

The elastomers show a visco-hyperelastic behavior. Models that describe large strains and [[viscoelasticity]] are required for the calculation of such actuators.

Materials used in research include graphite powder, silicone oil / graphite mixtures, gold electrodes. The electrode should be conductive and compliant. Compliance is important so that the elastomer is not constrained mechanically when elongated.&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

Films of polyacrylamide hydrogels formed with salt water can be laminated onto the dielectric surfaces, replacing electrodes.&lt;ref name=sci1308/&gt;

DEs based on silicone ([[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]]) and [[natural rubber]] are promising research fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madsen|first=Frederikke B.|last2=Daugaard|first2=Anders E.|last3=Hvilsted|first3=Søren|last4=Skov|first4=Anne L.|date=2016-03-01|title=The Current State of Silicone-Based Dielectric Elastomer Transducers|pmid=26773231|journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications|volume=37|issue=5|pages=378–413|doi=10.1002/marc.201500576|issn=1521-3927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Properties such as [[Response time (technology)|fast response]] times and efficiency are superior using natural rubber based DEs compared to VHB ([[Acrylate polymer|acrylic elastomer]]) based DEs for [[Deformation (mechanics)|strains]] under 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=S.

== Configurations ==

Configurations include:

* Framed/In-Plane actuators: A framed or in-plane actuator is an elastomeric film coated/printed with two electrodes. Typically a frame or support structure is mounted around the film. Examples are expanding circles and planars (single and multiple phase.)
* Cylindrical/Roll actuators: Coated elastomer films are rolled around an axis. By activation, a force and an elongation appear in the axial direction. The actuators can be rolled around a compression spring or without a core. Applications include artificial muscles ([[prosthetic]]s), mini- and [[microrobot]]s, and valves.
* Diaphragm actuators: A diaphragm actuator is made as a planar construction which is then biased in the z-axis to produce out of plane motion.
* Shell-like actuators: Planar elastomer films are coated at specific locations in the form of electrode segments. With a well-directed activation, the foils assume complex three-dimensional shapes. Examples may be utilized for propelling vehicles through air or water, e.g. for blimps.
* Stack actuators: Stacking planar actuators can increase deformation. Actuators that shorten under activation are good candidates.
* Thickness Mode Actuators: The force and stroke moves in the z-direction (out of plane). Thickness mode actuators are a typically a flat film that may stack layers to increase displacement.
*Bending actuators:The in-plane actuation of dielectric elastomer (DE) based actuator is converted into out-of-plane actuation such as bending or folding using unimorph configuration where one or multiple layers of DE sheets are stacked on top of one layer of inactive substrate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/094003 | volume=23 | title=Investigating the performance and properties of dielectric elastomer actuators as a potential means to actuate origami structures | journal=Smart Materials and Structures | pages=094003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], the '''donor principle''' refers primarily to the observance of the  original spelling of a [[loanword]] from the original ("donor") language. This principle applies in particular to the standardization in the receiver language of [[exonym]]s when they are used in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogeographics.org/sites/default/files/080205_D5.1_Exonyms%20guidelines%20synopsis.pdf|title= Exonyms guidelines synopsis |date= |website= |publisher= EuroGeoNames|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Peter Jordan |author2=Milan Orožen Adamič |author3=Paul Woodman |title= Exonyms and the International Standardisation of Geographical Names |url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=NVReAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22exonym%22+%22donor+principle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVfZqoTJU5&amp;sig=rdggekWiaLi1VCHjqyswhpCxhN8&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-sL0-_LPAhUoDcAKHW02Br0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exonym%22%20%22donor%20principle%22&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= 11|date= 2007|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term donor principle is sometimes also used for the particular spelling of names of specific products, brands, institutions etc. chosen by their owner, founder, designer, etc., when it clashes with the official spelling rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''"finger of God"''' is a phrase used in the [[Bible]]. In Exodus 8:16–20 it is used during the [[plagues of Egypt]] by the Egyptian priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|8:16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 9:10 it refers to the method by which the [[Ten Commandments]] were written on [[tablets of stone]] that were brought down from [[biblical Mount Sinai]] by [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|31:18|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|9:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used once by [[Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]] to describe how he had cast out demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|11:20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
The first time the phrase "finger of God" appears is in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the eighth chapter, in the paragraph of verses sixteen through twenty of the [[Book of Exodus]], which reads
{{quote|Then the Lord said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.'" And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt. The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on both humans and animals. And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God!" But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.|{{bibleref2|Exodus|8:16–20}}}}

The second time the phrase "finger of God" appears is at the last verse, verse eighteen of the thirty-first chapter of the same book, which reads "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."

The third time the phrase appears, and the last time in the Hebrew Bible, is a second reference to the tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], and is found in [[Deuteronomy]] 9:10, which says "And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."

==New Testament==
{{seealso|Exorcising the blind and mute man}}
The phrase is also used by [[Jesus]] in the Christian [[New Testament]] during his proof that he did not cast out demons by the power of [[Beelzebub]]. He said, "But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|11:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament story of [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery]], Jesus writes in the dust of the earth with his finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|8:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] notes from [[St Augustine]] that this gesture can be seen as portraying Christ as the divine legislator; Jesus' actions in writing in the dust are redolent of the Finger of God writing the Law on tablets of stone.&lt;ref name=Angelus&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/angelus/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_ang_20100321.html | title=Angelus | date=21 March 2010 | accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances Power Cobbe''' (4 December 1822 – 5 April 1904) was an Irish writer, social reformer, anti-[[vivisection]] activist, and leading [[women's suffrage]] campaigner. She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS) in 1875, and the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]].

She was the author of a number of books and essays, including ''The Intuitive Theory of Morals'' (1855), ''On the Pursuits of Women'' (1863), ''Cities of the Past'' (1864), ''Criminals, Idiots, Women and Minors'' (1869), ''Darwinism in Morals'' (1871), and ''Scientific Spirit of the Age'' (1888).

==Life==
[[File:Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Hajjin was Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion and traveled with her and her partner, Mary Lloyd, to Wales after Cobbe retired]]

Frances was a member of the prominent [[Cobbe family]], descended from Archbishop [[Charles Cobbe]], [[Primate of Ireland]]. She was born in [[Newbridge Estate|Newbridge House]] in the family estate in what is now [[Donabate]], Co. Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cobbe, Frances Power, with [[Blanche Atkinson]] |title=Life of Frances Power Cobbe as told by herself, |year=1904|location=London|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; co|page=74|url=https://archive.org/details/lifefrancespowe02atkigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe worked at the [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge Reformatory]] and lived with the owner, [[Mary Carpenter]], from 1858 to 1859, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.&lt;ref&gt;Saywell, R J, ''Mary Carpenter of Bristol'', The University of Bristol, 1964 (2001 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

Cobbe formed a relationship with the Welsh sculptor [[Mary Lloyd]] (1819-1896), whom she met in Rome in 1861 and lived with from 1864 until Lloyd's death. That death, in 1896, affected Cobbe badly. Her friend, the writer [[Blanche Atkinson,]] writing, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd’s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe. The joy of life had gone. It had been such a friendship as is rarely seen – perfect in love, sympathy, and mutual understand.” &lt;ref&gt; Shopland, Norena 'Frances and Mary' from ''Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales'' Seren Books (2017) &lt;/ref&gt; Around 1891 and in danger of losing their home at [[Hengwrt]], in which Lloyd had inherited a share on the death of her parents, the couple were relieved by a legacy of over £25,000 from the widow of [[Richard Vaughan Yates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=144, 335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are buried together at Saint Illtud Church Cemetery, [[Llanelltyd]], [[Gwynedd]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=139–147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In letters and published writing, Cobbe referred to Lloyd alternately as "husband," wife," and "dear friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFRWylXaAtAC&amp;pg=PA51|title=Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England |first=Sharon |last=Marcus|publisher= |year= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection (SPALV) in 1875, the world's first organisation campaigning against animal experiments, and in 1898 the BUAV, two groups that remain active. She was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and writer of editorial columns for London newspapers on [[suffrage]], property rights for women, and opposition to [[vivisection]]. Around 1880, with Louise Twining, she founded Homes for Workhouse Girls.&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, Eileen Janes (1992) Social motherhood and the sexual communion of labour in British Social Science, 1850-1950, ''[[Women's History Review]]'', 1:1, 63-87, DOI:

Cobbe met the Darwin family during 1868. [[Emma Darwin]] liked her, "Miss Cobbe was very agreeable." Frances persuaded [[Charles Darwin]] to read [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Metaphysics of Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Browne, Janet|title=Charles Darwin: The Power of Place|year=2002|publisher=Alfred A.

Cobbe's activism for women's rights included advocating for women to be allowed to take university examinations and therefore earn a degree at Oxford and Cambridge. She presented a paper at the Social Science Congress in 1862 to argue the issue &lt;ref&gt;Lynn McDonald, ed. 1998 ''Women Theorists on Society and Politics'' Wilfrid Laurier university Press, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada {{ISBN|0-88920-290-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54388">A '''Francophile''' ('''Gallophile''') is a person who has a strong affinity towards any or all of the [[French language]], [[French history]], [[French culture]] or [[French people]]. That affinity may include France itself or its [[History of France|history]], language, [[French cuisine|cuisine]], [[French literature|literature]], etc. The term "Francophile" can be contrasted with [[Francophobia|Francophobe]] (or Gallophobe), someone who dislikes all that is French.

Francophilia often arises in former [[French colony|French colonies]], where the [[elite]] spoke French and adopted many French habits. In other European countries such as [[Romania]] and [[Russia]], French culture has also long been popular among the [[upper class]].

Historically, Francophilia has been associated with supporters of the [[philosophy]] of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] during and after the [[French Revolution]], where [[democracy|democratic]] uprisings challenged the [[autocratic]] regimes of [[Europe]].

==Europe==

===Romania===
[[Romania]] has a long and deeply entrenched tradition of Francophilia beginning after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Revolutionary]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crampton, "Eastern Europe in the twentieth century and after", Routledge, 1997 (p.108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"&gt;Lucian Boia, "History and myth in Romanian consciousness", Central European University Press, 2001, (p.160)&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt the most famous contemporary Romanian Francophile is [[Eugen Weber]] (1925–2007), a prodigious author and lecturer in both English and French on [[French history]]. In his book "My France: politics, culture, myth", he writes: "Social relations, manners, attitudes that others had to learn from books, I lived in my early years. Romanian francophilia, Romanian francophony.... Many Romanians, in my day, dreamed of France; not many got there".&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber,  "My France: politics, culture, myth", Harvard University Press, 1992. (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the efforts to build Romania into a modern nation-state, with a national language and common national heritage, in the 19th century, the Romanian language was deliberately reoriented to its Latin heritage by a steady import of French neologisms suited to contemporary civilization and culture. "For ordinary Romanians, keen on the idea of the Latin roots of their language, 'Romance' meant 'French.'"&lt;ref&gt;Iannis Goerlandt, "Literature for Europe?", Rodopi, 2009. (p.421)&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 39% of Romanian vocabulary consists of borrowings from French, with an estimated 20% of "everyday" Romanian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, "History and myth in Romanian consciousness", Central European University Press, 2001, (p.163)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boia writes: "Once launched on the road of Westernization, the Romanian elite threw itself into the arms of France, the great Latin sister in the West. When we speak of the Western model, what is to be understood is first and foremost the French model, which comes far ahead of the other Western reference points."&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"/&gt; He quotes no less than the leading Romanian politician [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]], writing in 1907: "As the nations of Europe acquire their definitive borders and their social life becomes elaborated and crystallized within the precise limits of these borders, so their spiritual accomplishments will approach those of the French, and the immaterial substance of their souls will take on the luminous clarity, the smoothness and brilliance of the French mentality."&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"/&gt; [[Bucharest]] was rebuilt in the style of Paris in the 19th century, giving the city the nickname the "Paris of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other notable Romanian Francophiles include [[Georges Enesco]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Elie Wiesel]].

===Russia===
18th and 19th century Russian Francophilia is familiar to many from [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', and his characters from the Russian aristocracy converse in French and give themselves French names. At the time, the language of diplomacy and higher education across much of Europe was French. Russia, recently "modernized", or "Westernized", by the rule of sovereigns from [[Peter the Great]] to [[Catherine the Great]] was no exception. The Russian elite, in the early 18th century, were educated in the French tradition and made a conscious effort to imitate the manners of [[France]]. Their descendants, a generation or two later, were no longer "imitating" French customs but grew up with them, and the strong impact of the French culture on Russian upper and even middle classes was evident, on a smaller scale than in the 18th century, until the [[Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;Lurana Donnels O'Malley "The dramatic works of Catherine the Great: theatre and politics in eighteenth-century Russia", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Portugal===
{{Main|Afrancesado}}
"Afrancesado" (lit. "turned-French") was the term used for [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] partisans of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, [[liberalism]] or the [[French Revolution]]. It also denoted supporters of the [[Peninsular War|French occupation of Iberia]] and of the [[First French Empire]].

===Germany===
In the 18th century, French was the language of German elites. A notable Francophile was King [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia or Frédéric as he preferred to call himself. Frederick spoke and wrote notably better French than he did German, and all of his books were written in French, a choice of language that was of considerable embarrassment to German nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries when Frederick became the preeminent German national hero.&lt;ref&gt;Toews, John ''Becoming Historical Cultural Reformation and Public Memory in Early Nineteenth-Century Berlin'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2004 page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; One source noted: "Nor did Frederick have any time for German cultural chauvinism. As an ardent Francophile in matters literary and artistic, he took a low view of the German language, spoke it imperfectly himself, and once boasted that he had not read a book in German since his early youth. His preferences in music, art and architecture were overwhelmingly Italian and French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another German Francophile was King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], a.k.a. "Mad King Ludwig". Ludwig felt a great deal of affinity for King Louis XIV of France, the "Sun King" and liked to call himself the "Moon King" to suggest a parallel between himself and his hero. Ludwig loved to collect memorabilia relating to Louis and his [[Linderhof Palace]] was modeled after the Palace of Trianon.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Christoper ''The Swan King'', London: Penguin Books 1982 pages 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; An even more strikingly example of Ludwig's architectural Francophila was the Palace of [[Herrenchiemsee]], which was a copy of the Palace of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Christoper ''The Swan King'', London: Penguin Books 1982 page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
Francophilia or ''[[Rattachism]]'' is a marginal political ideology in some parts of Belgium. Rattachism would mean the incorporation of French speaking Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (and sometimes [[Brussels]]; more rarely of the entire Belgium) into [[France]]. This movement has existed since the [[Belgium|Belgian state]] came into existence in 1830.

The [[Manifesto for Walloon culture]] of 1983&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/manifesto-walloon-culture-1983 Manifesto for Walloon Culture (1983)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173010/http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/manifesto-walloon-culture-1983 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; relaunched in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/second-manifest-2003 Second Manifest (2003)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305210456/http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/second-manifest-2003 |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of discussions witnessed a will of [[emancipation]].

===Cyprus===
{{See also|Cyprus-France relations}}
The establishment of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]], in 1192, was the beginning of intense French influence on the island for the next three centuries. That influence, which touched almost every aspect of life on the island, would endure even after the end of [[Lusignan]] domination. It survives as part of [[Cypriot culture]]. The [[Republic of Cyprus]] became an associate member of the [[Francophonie]] in 2006.

===Armenia===
{{See also|Armenia–France relations}}
The Armenians of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilicia]] welcomed the [[Franks|Frankish]], or [[French people|French]], [[Crusaders]] of the [[Middle Ages]] as fellow [[Christians]]. There was much exchange, and the last dynasty to rule Armenian [[Cilicia]], the [[Lusignan]]s  (who ruled [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]), was of French origin.

During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], many Armenian manuscripts were taken into the National Library of France. [[Armenia]] and Armenian characters are featured in the works of [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Rousseau]]. The first instance of [[Armenian studies]] began with the creation of an Armenian department in the [[School of Oriental languages]], at the initiative of [[Napoleon]].

An important figure of Armenian Francophilia was that of [[Stepan Vosganian]] (1825–1901). Arguably the first Armenian "intellectual" and literary critic, Vosganian "represents the prototype of a long line of Armenian intellectuals nurtured in and identified with European, and particularly French, culture". Educated in Paris, he was a champion of [[liberalism]] and the [[positivism|positivist]] philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]], and he took part in the French [[Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Hovannisian, "The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign dominion to statehood : the fifteenth century to the twentieth century", Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. (p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French political classes were on the whole supportive of the [[Armenian national movement]]. The French–Armenian Agreement (1916) was a political and military accord to create the [[French Armenian Legion|Armenian Legion]] in the [[French Army]] to fight on the Allied side of [[World War I]], in return for promises of recognition of Armenian independence. The Armenian Legion engaged successfully in [[Anatolia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during [[World War I]], particularly at the [[Battle of Arara]] and during the [[Franco-Turkish War]].

===Serbia===
[[File:Monument to France.jpg|thumb|Monument of gratitude to France for help in World War I in center of [[Belgrade]], [[Belgrade Fortress]]]]
The oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of [[Stephen Uroš I of Serbia]] and [[Helen of Anjou]] in the 13th century.

The first important contacts of [[French people|French]] and [[Serbs]] came only in the 19th century, when the first French travel writers wrote about their travels to Serbia.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"&gt;[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8555/2009/0025-85550904536S.pdf Francusko-srpski odnosi u XIX i XX veku] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707070451/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8555/2009/0025-85550904536S.pdf |date=July 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time [[Karađorđe Petrović]], the leader of the [[Serbian Revolution]], sent a letter to [[Napoleon]] expressing his admiration. On the other hand, in the [[French parliament]], [[Victor Hugo]] asked France to assist in protecting Serbia and the Serbian population from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] crimes. Diplomatic relations with France were established on 18 January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/France/basic_e.html]
 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630163421/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/France/basic_e.html |date=June 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid development of bilateral relations done that people in Serbia in "mighty France" seen great new friend that will protect them from the [[Ottomans]] and [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; Relations between [[Serbia]] and France would go upwards until the [[First World War]], when the "common struggle" against a common enemy would reach its peak. Before the war, France would win sympathy of local population by building railways by opening of French schools and a consulate and a Bank. Several Serbian kings  were at universities in [[Paris]] as well as a large part of the future diplomats.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; Serbs have built a sense of Francophilia because the activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; For Serbs until 1914, French have become major allies what were even a threat for traditional inclination towards Russia. The great humanitarian and military assistance that France sent to Serbia during First World War, assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end, and the support of French newspaper headlines even today are deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of large number of Serbs.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt;

Notable Serbian Francophiles include [[Ilija Garašanin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313082434/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=5 |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sava Šumanović]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gk-srbije-vukovar.hr/spomenici.html Generalni Konzulat Republike Srbije] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105101/http://www.gk-srbije-vukovar.hr/spomenici.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The traditional Anglo-French antagonism has made Francophilia something of a rarity within the United Kingdom, but there have been exceptions.

* Colonel [[T. E. Lawrence]], a.k.a. "Lawrence of Arabia" is often depicted as a Francophobe, but the French historian Maurice Larès wrote that far from being a Francophobe as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile.&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220-242"&gt;Larès, Maurice "T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?" pages 220-242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Larès wrote: "But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of ''Le Gigantesque''  (''[[The Forest Giant]]'') reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings".&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220-242"/&gt;

====Government &amp; military====

* General [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend]] was a Francophile who liked to be addressed as ""Alphonse" and whose "Frenchified" manners often annoyed his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Geoffrey ''Great Military Blunders'', Oxford: PastTimes, 2000 page 97&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomat Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert "Van" Vansittart]] was a passionate Francophile who worked as a successful playwright in Paris before entering the Foreign Office.&lt;ref name="Doerr, Paul page 137"&gt;Doerr, Paul ''British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998 page 137&lt;/ref&gt; Vansittart always explained his Francophilia and Germanophobia under the grounds that as young man living in Europe the French were always kind to him while the Germans were cruel.&lt;ref name="Doerr, Paul page 137"/&gt;
* The British Army officer and Conservative MP General Sir [[Edward Spears]] was a Francophile |who as a fluent French-speaker served as a liaison officer between the French and British armies in both world wars. Spears was also an opponent of appeasement who founded the Anglo-French Parliamentary Association to bring together like-minded members of the French National Assembly and the British Parliament.
* Sir [[Winston Churchill]] was a Francophile who often expressed his admiration for France though the French historian [[François Kersaudy]] noted that Churchill's attempts to speak French usually left the French very confused as to what he was trying to say as Churchill's French was atrocious.&lt;ref&gt;Kersaudy, François ''Churchill and de Gaulle'', Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill often spoke of his love of the French, writing that Marshal Foch represented one aspect of France, "...the France, whose grace and culture, whose etiquette and ceremonial have bestowed its gifts around the world. There was the France of chivalry, the France of Versailles and above all, the France of Joan of Arc".&lt;ref name="Kersaudy, François page 26"&gt;Kersaudy, François ''Churchill and de Gaulle'', Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Kersaudy called Churchill France's most "forceful and vocal champion" in interwar Britain, a time when many people saw the Treaty of Versailles as a vindictive, French-engineered treaty which was too harsh towards Germany, and accordingly Francophobia flourished among circles in Britain in favor of revising Versailles in favor of the ''Reich''.&lt;ref name="Kersaudy, François page 26"/&gt;
* It was frequently observed of Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]], the Francophile Foreign Secretary 1924-29 that he "loved France like a woman, for her defects and her qualities", an aspect of his personality that Chamberlain was often attacked for.&lt;ref&gt;Self, Robert ''The Austen Chamberlain Diary Letters: The Correspondence of Sir Austen Chamberlain with His Sisters Hilda and Ida, 1916-1937'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Conservative MP [[Duff Cooper|Alfred Duff Cooper]] was in the words of the historian P.H Bell such a "devoted Francophile" that his time as British ambassador to France that he often tried the patience of the Foreign Office by going well beyond his instructions to maintain good relations with France by trying to create an Anglo-French alliance that would dominate post-war Europe.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 72"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bell also called Sir [[Anthony Eden]] a strong "Francophile" noted for his efforts as Foreign Secretary to reviving France as a great power during World War II.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 72"/&gt; The novelist [[Nancy Mitford]] was a great Francophile who lived in Paris from 1946 until her death in 1973, and from 1943 onwards she served as the long-time mistress of [[Gaston Palewski]], the right-hand man of General de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Writers====

* The writer [[Charles Dickens]] was a Francophile who often vacationed in France and in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French called the French "the first people in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Soubigou, Gilles "Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries" pages 154-167 from ''The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe'' edited by Michael Hollington London: A&amp;C Black 2013 page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another British Francophile was the writer [[Rudyard Kipling]], who argued very strongly after World War I for an Anglo-French alliance to uphold the peace, calling Britain and France in 1920 the "twin fortresses of European civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, David ''The Long Recessional: The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling'', London: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2002 pages 300.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The writer [[Raymond Mortimer]] was such a Francophile that he broke down in tears when he heard France had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany on 21 June 1940, saying it was if half of England had just fallen into the sea.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 22"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Francophile writer and historian [[Denis William Brogan]] wrote after hearing of the armistice of 1940 that he very much looked forward to the day when the "eternal France" which he loved would return.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 22"/&gt; The Francophile novelist [[Charles Langbridge Morgan]] dedicated his 1940 novel ''The Voyage'' to two French friends, writing "France is an ideal necessary for civilization and will live again when tyranny is spent".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The writer, diplomat and National Labour MP [[Harold Nicolson]] was a Francophile who when he visited France for the first time in five years in March 1945, he fell to kiss the earth upon landing in France.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 66"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; When a Frenchman asked the prostrate Nicolson "''Monsieur a laissé tomber quelque-chose?''" ("Sir, have you dropped something?"), Nicolson replied "''Non, j'ai retrouvé quelque-chose''" (No, I have recovered something").&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 66"/&gt;

==Asia==

===Iran===
As with much of the Western world and the Middle East at the time, Francophilia was quite common in Iran in the 19th century, and even so more in the 20th century. In Iran, many key politicians and diplomats of the 20th century were French-educated or avid Francophiles. Among them [[Teymur Bakhtiar]], the founder of the Iranian intelligence agency, [[SAVAK]]; [[Amir-Abbas Hoveida]], [[Prime Minister of Iran]] from 1965 to 1977; [[Hassan Pakravan]], a diplomat and intelligence figure; [[Nader Jahanbani]], [[General]] under the last [[Shah]]; and Abdullah Entezam-Saltaneh, another famous diplomat to the West.

{{quote|And if there was one thing that characterized the Shah and the [[ancien regime]] of Hoveydas and Tabatabais, it was francophilia, French education, the French language. [[The Shah]] himself had attended [[Le Rosey]] in Switzerland. French lycees flourished in [[Teheran]]. The [[Shahbanou]] herself was part of the francophilia that in Iran was as notable a feature as it had been of pre-Revolutionary [[Russia]]. England was always, in Iranian eyes, the suspect, the enemy. England was the country of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. But France offered the "perfected civilisation" of [[Chamfort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheikyermami.com/fitzgerald-ayatollah-khomeini-and-fethulleh-gulen-how-islamic-revolutions-come-about/ "Fitzgerald: Ayatollah Khomeini And Fethulleh Gulen, (how Islamic revolutions come about)"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In a speech delivered in French in Paris during a state visit on 11 October 1961, the Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] spoke of his "special affinity for France, and the lofty place the French language has held in Iran's educational curriculum".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Reza spoke of the long history of Franco-Iranian friendship "going back to the age of Philip le Bel, who was the recipient of the first letter from an Iranian king".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"/&gt; The Shah went on to praise France as the land where every Iranian owes a debt as "the first translation of our classics to your countrymen. Teaching Persian in Europe first began in Paris in the late 18th century. The first relics of our antiquity were discovered by French anthropologists".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"/&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===

[[Orientalism]] first arose in [[Early Modern]] [[France]] with [[Guillaume Postel]] and the French Embassy to the court of the Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref&gt;Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina 2008 Orientalism in Early Modern France (p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when [[Mehmed IV]] sent the ambassador [[Müteferrika Süleyman Ağa]] to the court of [[Louis XIV]] in 1669, it caused a sensation that triggered the [[Turquerie]] fashion craze in France and then the rest of Western Europe, which lasted until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id==ZDljPtPJLbkC&amp;pg==PA8&amp;dq==ottoman+alliance+%22Louis+XIV%22&amp;as_brr==3&amp;ei==F63TSeqbOIyENPuMhYYJ&amp;hl==en#PPA8,M1 Göçek, p. 8]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziya Gökalp, Rober, "The Principles of Turkism", Brill Archive (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] granted [[France]] special privileges on account of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. French mercantilism was protected, French subjects were exempt from the taxes and tributes normally required of Christian residents of the Empire, no French subjects could be taken into Ottoman slavery and French subjects were granted full freedom of worship. Thus, France became the unofficial protector of all Catholics in the East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenianhouse.org/bliss/turkey/10-turkey-europe.html ArmenianHouse.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513184128/http://armenianhouse.org/bliss/turkey/10-turkey-europe.html |date=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial influence increased in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[French language]] and customs penetrated deep into the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] learned classes and aristocracy; French was the preferred second language, rich Ottomans sent their children to school and Universities in France and the Western "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]" was associated with French culture&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Panzac, "Histoire économique et sociale de l'Empire ottoman et de la Turquie (1326-1960): actes du sixième congrès international tenu à Aix-en-Provence du 1er au 4 juillet 1992", Peeters Publishers, 1995.

The [[French Revolution]] and its ideals of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" inspired many secular and progressive movements in [[Ottoman Turkey]], including the [[Young Turk]] movement that would go on to create the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Niyazi Berkes]], Feroz Ahmad, The Development of Secularism in Turkey, Routledge, 1998. (Page lxxxiv)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]]'s breaking of the age-old Franco-Ottoman alliance by conquering [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Egypt]] also had an effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1852/10/11/87843198.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali the Great]], who became the Ottoman [[Vali (governor)|''vali'']] (governor) of Egypt in 1805 and ruled as a ''de facto'' independent ruler until his death in 1848 had been strongly impressed with the Napoleon's ''Armée d'Orient'', and imported French veterans of the Napoleonic wars to train his army.&lt;ref name="Russell, Mona page 205"&gt;Russell, Mona ''Egypt'', Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO 2013 page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was very much in the French sphere of influence politically, economically and culturally in the 19th century, and French was the preferred language of Egypt's elites right up to the 1952 revolution.&lt;ref name="Russell, Mona page 205"/&gt; At the court of the Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]] of Egypt, better known as Isma'il the Magnificent the languages used were French and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Elizabeth ''Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2013 page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his Francophilia, the French-educated Isma'il emulated [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]] by tearing down much of [[Cairo]] to rebuild it in the style of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, André ''Cairo''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2000 pages 313-314&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, the architecture of [[Downtown Cairo]] closely resembles that of downtown Paris.

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon, Franophilia is very common among the Christian Maronites who have seen the 19th century viewed the French as their "guardian angels", their special protectors and friends in their struggles against the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Asher "Tell Us Our History': Charles Corm, Mount Lebanon and Lebanese Nationalism" pages 1-28 from ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 40, No. 3, May 2004 page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the French intervened to put a stop to the massacres of the Maronites by the Muslims and the Druze which were being permitted by the Ottoman authorities, earning them the lasting thanks of the Maronites. Starting in the 19th century, much of the Maronite elite was educated at Jesuit schools in France, making the Maronites one of the most ardently Francophile groups in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Kaufman pages 1-28"&gt;Kaufman, Asher "Tell Us Our History': Charles Corm, Mount Lebanon and Lebanese Nationalism" pages 1-28 from ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 40, No. 3, May 2004 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese writer [[Charles Corm]] in a series of poems in French published after World War I portrayed the Lebanese as a "Phoenician" people whose Christianity and Francophilia made them part of the West and who had nothing to do either with the Arabs or Islam.&lt;ref name="Kaufman pages 1-28"/&gt;

===Japan===
Prince [[Saionji Kinmochi]], a ''genro'' (elder statesmen) was educated in France, where he received a law degree at the Sorbonne.&lt;ref&gt;Macilllan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House, 2007 page 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In words of the Canadian historian [[Margaret Macmillan]], Saionji "...loved the French, their culture and their liberal traditions. He even spoke French in his sleep. To the end of his life, he drank Vichy water and wore Houbigant cologne, which had to be imported specially for him".&lt;ref&gt;Macilllan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House, 2007 page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Saionji was merely an extreme case of the Francophilia that characterized Meiji Japan. The Justice Minister, [[Etō Shimpei]] was an admirer of the French who modeled the legal and administrative systems together with the police force after that of France.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"&gt;Sim, Richard ''French Policy Towards the Bakufu and Meiji Japan 1854-95''Psychology Press, 1998 page 258.&lt;/ref&gt; A French lawyer [[Gustave Boissonade]] was recruited to draft the Japanese legal code, which is why the Japanese legal code today very closely resembles the Code Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Richard ''French Policy Towards the Bakufu and Meiji Japan 1854-95''Psychology Press, 1998 pages 97 &amp; 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French lawyer, Prosper Gambet-Gross served as the special advisor to [[Kawaji Toshiyoshi]] who created a French-style police force for Japan.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"/&gt; The Japanese educational system from 1872 onward was modeled after the French educational system and in the same year Japan was divided into prefectures as the French administrative system was considered by the Japanese to be the best in Europe.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"/&gt; The Japanese received a French military mission in 1870 to train their army as the French Army was considered the best in the world. After France's defeat in the war of 1870-71, the Japanese sent the French military mission home, to be replaced by a German military mission as the German victory led the Japanese to the conclusion that the Germans were better soldiers.

The Japanese writer [[Kafū Nagai]] wrote after visiting France: &lt;blockquote&gt;"No matter how much I wanted to sing Western songs, they were all very difficult. Had I, born in Japan, no choice but to sing Japanese songs? Was there a Japanese song that expressed my present sentiment -- a traveler who had immersed himself in love and the arts in France but was now going back to the extreme end of the Orient where only death would follow monotonous life? . . . I felt totally forsaken. I belonged to a nation that had no music to express swelling emotions and agonized feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Africa==

===Central African Empire===
Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the Army of the Central African Republic seized power in 1965 and ruled until he was deposed by French troops in 1979. Bokassa was a great Francophile who maintained extremely close relations with France, often going elephant hunting with the French President [[Valéry Giscard d’Estaing]].&lt;ref name="Nostalgia for a Nightmare"&gt;{{cite web

===Gabon===
[[Omar Bongo]], the long time dictator of [[Gabon]] from 1967 until his death in 2009 was described by ''The Economist'' in 2016 as "every inch the Francophile" who was very close to successive governments in Paris from the time he came to power until his death.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite web

===The Ivory Coast===
President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] of the Côte d'Ivoire was described as a "staunch Francophile" who maintained very close links with France, and successfully insisted that the French name for his country be used instead of the Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==North America==

===Canada===
{{main|French language in Canada}}
With the inception of [[Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the institution of [[French immersion]] in many schools following the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]], many [[English Canadian|Canadians of English heritage]] have developed a greater appreciation for the French culture that is a part of the [[Canadian identity]]. English and French are the two [[official languages of Canada]] and two of its founding languages.

===United States===
In America, there is great interest in French culture, including French food, art, philosophy, politics, as well as the French lifestyle in general. Historically, French style, particularly that of Paris, has long been considered the height of sophistication by Americans of all social classes.

====Historical====
[[France in the American Revolutionary War|French support of the American Revolution]] was probably a significant factor in shaping American's feelings towards France. Prior to that, the French had been seen as rivals for control of North America until their decisive defeat in the [[French and Indian War]]. With the elimination of France as a major colonial power in North America, the rivalry between American colonists and British interests became primary, and France's role switched to that of a counter to British power.

Pro-French sentiment was probably strengthened by the overthrow of the French monarchy and the creation of a "brother-republic" in France. Notwithstanding the turmoil of the [[French Revolution]], certain disputes between the two countries, and the renewal of British-American ties, generally good relations continued. During the Napoleonic era, the [[Louisiana Purchase]], and the entry of the United States into another [[War of 1812|war]] against Britain, concurrent with [[Napoleonic wars|Franco-British hostilities]], gave a certain sense of common cause.

Among the most famous early American Francophiles was [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, "Jefferson and France: An Essay on Politics and Political Ideas", Yale University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Schuckel "The origins of Thomas Jefferson as a Francophile, 1784-1789", Butler University, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Even during the excesses of the [[Reign of Terror]], Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because he was, as Jean Yarbrough wrote, "convinced that the fates of the two republics were indissolubly linked. To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Jean M. Yarbrough, The essential Jefferson, Hackett Publishing, 2006. (p. xx)&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the continuing revolutions in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], Jefferson predicted that "this ball of liberty, I believe most piously, is now so well in motion that it will roll round the globe, at least the enlightened part of it, for light &amp; liberty go together. it is our glory that we first put it into motion."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Paul Leicester Ford, "The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: 1795-1801", G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1896. (p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson would often sign his letters "Affectionately adieu" and commented late in life "France, freed from that monster, Bonaparte, must again become the most agreeable country on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Henry Augustine Washington "The writings of Thomas Jefferson", Taylor &amp; Maury, 1854. (p. 402)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 film ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' by [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]], recalls the connection. The "staunchly Francophile"&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Victor Rostow, "A breakfast for Bonaparte: U.S. national security interests from the Heights of Abraham to the nuclear age" DIANE Publishing, 1992. (p. 116)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and, by extension, his adherents or "[[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]]", were characterized by his political enemies, the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], as "decadent, ungodly and immoral Francophiles".&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Verhoeven, Beth Dolan Kautz, ''Revolutions &amp; Watersheds: Transatlantic Dialogues, 1775-1815'', Rodopi, 1999, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Franklin]], who spent seven years as the popular [[United States Ambassador to France]] was also a Francophile.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''The Age of Wonder: The Romantic Generation and the Discovery of the Beauty and Terror of Science'' (2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] Republican Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] spent his first three grades in a Parisian school and majored in Romance Languages and Literatures at [[Harvard]]. [[Henry Cabot Lodge Sr.]], his grandfather, was also a Francophile and befriended [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], the French Ambassador to the US.

====Various====
Many Americans have studied at art schools in France, including the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts academy in Paris]], the premier institution of its kind in the country. The students and graduated alumni have been deeply influential on American style, particularly during the 19th and the early 20th centuries.

Francophile sentiment in America was deeply influential on American public opinion and involvement in both [[World Wars]]. The Francophile filmmaker [[Preston Sturges]] always considered France his "second home" where he spent much of his childhood, was fluent in French and was greatly influenced by the films of his close friend [[René Clair]].&lt;ref&gt;Viviani, Christiana "Hail the Conquering Autuer: Preston Sturges in ''La Revue de cinéma''"  pages 280-292 from ''ReFocus: The Films of Preston Sturges'' edited by Jeff Jaeckle,Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015 pages 280-281&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of cuisine, [[Julia Child]] is probably the most famous of many Francophile-American chefs and of many American graduates of French cooking-schools.

====Actors====

Other notable francophiles include actor [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Blake Lively]],&lt;ref&gt;Minute Help Guides, "The Unofficial Blake Lively Biography" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalie Portman]], [[Molly Ringwald|Molly]] [[Molly Ringwald|Ringwald]], Steven Gabrielle and Robert Crawford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The director and actor [[Woody Allen]] is a Francophile whose films often made references to French cinema, philosophy and novels.&lt;ref&gt;Menegaldo, Gilles "Woody Allen and France"  from ''A Companion to Woody Allen'' pages 53-72edited by Peter J. Bailey and Sam B. Girgus, London: Blackwell, 2013 pages 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme in Allen's films is the celebration of Paris as the ideal place for romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;Menegaldo, Gilles "Woody Allen and France"  from ''A Companion to Woody Allen'' pages 53-72 edited by Peter J. Bailey and Sam B. Girgus, London: Blackwell, 2013 pages 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen's 1982 film ''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' frequently pays homage to the work of [[Jean Renoir]] while Allen has described [[François Truffaut]] as his favorite director.&lt;ref&gt;Menegaldo, Gilles "Woody Allen and France"  from ''A Companion to Woody Allen'' pages 53-72 edited by Peter J. Bailey and Sam B. Girgus, London: Blackwell, 2013 pages 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The Francophile hero of Allen's 2011 film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' Gil Pender bears striking similarities with Allen, leading to reviewers to suggest that the character of Pender is a stand-in for the director-writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Business====

The French-American Chamber of Commerce organization has worked to promote business ties between the two countries. A ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' interview has described the [[Beaujolais (wine)|Beaujolais]] [[Wine Festival]], the largest such festival in the US, as a major event for those interested in French culture to mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/lifetravel/stories/DN-mytown_0125gd.ART.State.Edition1.12e51.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130120071441/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/lifetravel/stories/DN-mytown_0125gd.ART.State.Edition1.12e51.html|deadurl=yes|title=Dallasnews.com - News for Dallas, Texas - The Dallas Morning News|date=20 January 2013|archivedate=20 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] liked to call himself the "Napoleon of the West", and during his rule, the Mexican Army wore uniforms that closely resembled the uniforms of Napoleon's ''Grande Armée''. Since the times of [[Porfirio Díaz]], the Mexican upper class has shown a strong admiration of French culture, language, architecture and customs.

===Haiti===
The Republic of [[Haiti]] was once the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] until a successful slave revolt drove the French out. Despite this history, the Haitian elite was traditionally very Francophile to the point that the Haitian writer [[Jean Price-Mars]] published a book in 1928 ''Ainsi Parla l'Oncle'' (So Spoke the Uncle) accusing the elite of ''bovarysme'', of intentionally neglecting and ignoring traditional Haitian folk culture as it had too many West African elements and was not French enough for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Martin "Haiti" pages 551-556 from ''France And The Americas: Culture, Politics, And History'' edited by Bill Marshall &amp; Cristina Johnston Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005 page 555.&lt;/ref&gt; About 10% of Haiti's population speak French as their first language while the other 90% speak [[Haitian Creole|''Kréyol'']] (a mixture of French and various West African languages) that has often been mocked by the Francophile Haitian elite as a bastardized French.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, David ''From Dessalines to Duvalier: Race, Colour, and National Independence in Haiti'' New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1996 pages xxiv-xxv&lt;/ref&gt; In Haiti, the question of whatever one speaks French or ''Kréyol'' is racially charged as the elite tended to be mulattos while the masses are black.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
Australian people are mostly leaning toward francophilia. Australia is tied to France through history: visit from [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]] and assistance during [[World War I]]. Australian also appreciate and look up to French culture and cuisine. Shops often try to make their name sound French&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapetoparis.com/2010/12/no-escaping%E2%80%A6-australian-francophilia/&lt;/ref&gt; and a trip to Paris is a common prize in games or often pictured in advertisements.

[[Bastille day]] is celebrated in Sydney though a 4-days festival, drawing up to 500'000 person.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/music-and-dancing-in-the-streets-bringing-bastille-day-to-sydney-20170712-gx9kdj.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}'''''Gone Girl''''' is a [[thriller novel]] by the writer [[Gillian Flynn]]. It was published by  [[Crown Publishing Group]] in June 2012. The novel soon made the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. The novel's suspense comes from Nick Dunne, and whether he is involved in the disappearance of his wife.

In several interviews, Flynn has said that she was inspired to write the novel by the disappearance of [[Laci Peterson]]. In portraying her principal characters who are out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

Critics in the [[United States]] positively received and reviewed the novel. Reviewers praised the novel's use of unreliable narration, plot twists, and suspense.

A [[Gone Girl (film)|film adaptation]], directed by [[David Fincher]] and written by Flynn, with [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Rosamund Pike]] starring, was released on October 3, 2014. The film was met with both commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.

== Plot summary ==

The first part of the novel centres on Nick Dunne and his wife Amy's marriage. Its point of view alternates between that of Nick and Amy, whose perspectives on their marriage are very different. For example, Nick describes the couple's relationship in the present day, while Amy's diary entries depict their relationship in the past. Amy's diary portrays Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle, and threatening husband, while Nick describes Amy as someone who is needlessly difficult, anti-social, stubborn, and an irrational perfectionist.

When Nick and Amy both lose their jobs in [[New York City]], they relocate to Nick's hometown in North Carthage, [[Missouri]] to help take care of Nick's sick mother. This causes their marriage to take a turn: Amy loved their life in New York, hates living in the Midwest, and soon begins to resent Nick for making her move to his hometown.

On their wedding anniversary, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick eventually becomes a suspect in her disappearance. Among other reasons, his lack of emotion about Amy's disappearance and the discovery that Amy was pregnant when she went missing lead both the police and the public to believe that Nick may have murdered his wife.

In the second half of the book, the reader learns that the main characters are [[unreliable narrator]]s, and that the reader is not being given all of the information. Nick is revealed to have been cheating on his wife, and Amy is revealed to be alive and in hiding, and trying to [[Frameup|frame]] Nick for her "death" as revenge for his perceived wrongs against her. Her pregnancy and her diary entries are revealed to be fake; Amy fabricated them in order to further incriminate Nick. Her plan is foiled, however, when she is robbed at the motel she is hiding in. Desperate, she seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Desi Collings, who agrees to hide her in his lake house but soon becomes possessive, causing Amy to feel trapped.

Meanwhile, Nick has discovered that Amy is framing him for her murder based on the items she bought using credit cards in his name and hid in his sister Margo's woodshed, along with her anniversary gift of [[Punch and Judy]] puppets, one of which is missing a handle. However, since the clues she left for him on their annual anniversary treasure hunt are so ambiguous and based on their inside jokes that no one else would get them, he has no way of proving it.

Together, he and his lawyer work to change the public's perception of Nick. He is granted an interview with a popular talk show host, during which Nick pretends to be apologetic for his infidelity and appeals to Amy to come back. It goes well with the public, but unfortunately the police have discovered the items in the woodshed that Nick swore he didn't buy: boxes of demeaning and violent porn videos, and Amy's diary. A few weeks later, they bring out the missing handle from the Punch and Judy puppets that had been soaked in Amy's blood and discovered in the fireplace, and arrest Nick.

At Desi's lake house, Amy sees the TV interview and is convinced that Nick really does want her back. She murders Desi after seducing him and returns to her husband, who is out on bond. Upon her return, she fabricates a story that she had been kidnapped and imprisoned by Desi. Although Nick knows she's lying, he has no proof and is forced to return to married life with Amy as the media storm dies down.

Though forced to remain with his wife, Nick soon begins writing a memoir detailing Amy's crimes and deceptions. Aware of Nick's intentions to expose her lies, Amy uses Nick's [[semen]] they had saved at a fertility clinic to make herself pregnant. She then forces him to delete his book by threatening to keep him from their unborn child. In the end, Nick deletes his memoir and chooses to stay with Amy for his child's sake.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gone Girl|last=Flynn|first=Gillian|publisher=Crown|year=2012|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition and publication ==
Gillian Flynn is a former writer for ''Entertainment Weekly'' who wrote two popular novels prior to ''Gone Girl'' — ''[[Sharp Objects]]'' and ''[[Dark Places (novel)|Dark Places]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|title=Hollywood's Most Powerful Authors: Gillian Flynn on Adapting ''Gone Girl'', Being Too 'Wimpy' for Crime Reporting and Her Best Advice to Writers (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gone-girl-author-gillian-flynn-395337|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Gone Girl'' is her best selling book to date. Her other two books were about people incapable of making commitments, but in this novel, she tried to depict the ultimate commitment, marriage: "I liked the idea of marriage told as a he-said, she-said story, and told by two narrators who were perhaps not to be trusted." Flynn has also described marriage as "the ultimate mystery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haupt|first=Jennifer|title=Best-selling Author Gillian Flynn: ''Gone Girl'' |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/one-true-thing/201211/best-selling-author-gillian-flynn-gone-girl|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=Psychology Today|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn admits to putting some of herself in the character of Nick Dunne. Like Dunne, she was a popular culture writer. Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job.&lt;ref name="Memmott"&gt;{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Carol|title=Gillian Flynn talks 'Gone Girl,' success and movie deals|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2012/10/08/gillian-flynn-interview/1610623/|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn said, "I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something that you were going to do for the rest of your life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character."&lt;ref name="Rousseau"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rousseau|first=Caryn|title=Flynn's 'Gone Girl' poised to be summer thriller|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120622/us-books-gillian-flynn/|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked how she can write so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, "I'm kind of part guy myself." When she needs to understand something about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend.&lt;ref name="Memmott" /&gt;  Flynn's autobiographical essay "I Was Not a Nice Little Girl..." invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." A favourite indoor game called "Mean Aunt Rosie" allowed Flynn to cast herself as a "witchy caregiver" who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flynn |first=Gillian |title=I Was Not a Nice Little Girl |url=http://www.powells.com/essays/flynn.html |publisher=Powells.com |accessdate=24 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217071048/http://www.powells.com/essays/flynn.html |archive-date=17 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/gillian-flynn/news/talk-070612 |author= Flynn, Gillian |date= July 6, 2012|title= Author Essay: July 6, 2012 |publisher= Bookreporter.com  |accessdate= December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn identified [[Zoë Heller]]'s ''[[Notes on a Scandal]]'' and [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' as influences on her writing and, in particular, on the plot and themes of ''Gone Girl''. Flynn said she admired the "ominous" ending of ''Notes on a Scandal'' and the pathology of a bad marriage from ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''. For the conclusion of ''Gone Girl'', Flynn drew from ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'': "I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, and guess what? Mom kind of likes him!'" she said.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news |last= Lee |first= Stephan |title=Best of 2012 (Behind the Scenes): Gillian Flynn on 'Gone Girl' twists &amp;ndash; 'It's fine with me if people don't like the ending' |url= http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/12/04/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-ending/ |accessdate= 24 December 2012 |newspaper= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= 4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn also says she is influenced by the mystery writers [[Laura Lippman]], [[Karin Slaughter]], [[George Pelecanos]], [[Dennis Lehane]], and [[Harlan Coben]]. However, she tries not to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[T.C. Boyle]], and [[Arthur Phillips]], who are better known as realistic contemporary writers.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

''Gone Girl'' is also the title of a [[Lew Archer]] story, in the 1955 collection ''The Name is Archer'', by [[Ross Macdonald]], who Flynn has also cited as a favorite author.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/595206.The_Name_Is_Archer Goodreads listing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==
''Gone Girl'' is an example of mystery, suspense, and crime genres. A ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' review, for instance, notes that the book is "more than just a crime novel". The review goes on to describe ''Gone Girl'' as a "masterful psychological thriller" which offers "an astute and thought-provoking look into two complex personalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Reilly |first= Amy |title= Still Worth the Hype: Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl' |url= http://www.rd.com/recommends/still-worth-the-hype-gillian-flynns-gone-girl/ |accessdate=26 December 2012 |newspaper=Reader's Digest |date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' review notes that ''Gone Girl'' uses many of the devices common to thrillers—a cast of viable suspects, unfolding secrets, and [[red herring]]s. However, the novel does more with these devices than the thriller genre requires: "While serving their usual functions, they also do much more, launching us into an unnerving dissection of the fallout of failed dreams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Gutman |first= Amy |title= A marriage gone missing |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-28/features/ct-prj-0603-gone-girl-20120728_1_nick-person-investigation-printers-row |accessdate=26 December 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''New York Times'' review, [[Janet Maslin]] also writes that the elements of ''Gone Girl'' that "sound like standard-issue crime story machinations" are not, because both narrators are also consummate liars and cannot be trusted to convey the truth about their own stories.&lt;ref name="Maslin"&gt;{{cite news |last= Maslin |first= Janet |title= The Lies That Buoy, Then Break a Marriage |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/books/gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn.html |accessdate= 26 December 2012 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon.com]] writes that ''Gone Girl'' has literary features that enhance the crime genre features, adding that Flynn is "kicking the genre into high gear."&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Flynn herself says that, in writing ''Gone Girl'', she employed the mystery genre as a "thru-lane" to explore what she was really interested in: relationships.&lt;ref name="Memmott" /&gt;

== Themes ==
''Gone Girl's'' themes include dishonesty, the devious media, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy, and the superficial nature of appearance. The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, yet at the same time the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit."

An underlying theme is the brief undertone of feminism, most notably represented in Amy's 'Cool Girl' speech. For some, it is in this monologue that the otherwise despised Amazing Amy emerges as an unlikely heroine of sorts; flying the flag for women who refuse to succumb to the pressure to morph into the male's ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Girl: 3 reasons why I'm #TeamAmy|url=http://www.wildhormoans.com/2015/02/gone-girl-3-reasons-why-im-teamamy.html|publisher=wildhormoans|accessdate=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212140831/http://www.wildhormoans.com/2015/02/gone-girl-3-reasons-why-im-teamamy.html|archive-date=12 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn is a self-identified feminist and has stated that Amy's "just pragmatically evil" character and non-conformity to the traditional [["Women are wonderful" effect|perception of women as innately good]] characters are the embodiment of feminism, which she defined as "the ability to have women who are bad characters."&lt;ref name=flynnga&gt;{{cite web|title=Gillian Flynn on her bestseller Gone Girl and accusations of misogyny|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/gillian-flynn-bestseller-gone-girl-misogyny|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviews have also noted how well ''Gone Girl'' shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media coverage before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that "Flynn, a former staff writer for ''Entertainment Weekly'', is especially good on the infiltration of the media into every aspect of the missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV [[The Furies|Fury]], who is out to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on [[Nancy Grace]]."&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=Gone Girl: Marriage can be murder|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/gone_girl_marriage_can_be_murder/|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays on reader expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, "The first half of ''Gone Girl'' is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture and the way in which 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'"&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite news|last=Giles|first=Jeff|title=Gone Girl review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20597896,00.html|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New York Daily News'' review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: "In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There’s no need for a body to arrive at a verdict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connelly|first=Sherryl|title=Book Review: 'Gone Girl' by Gillian Flynn |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/book-review-girl-gillian-flynn-article-1.1086025 |accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |date=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: "Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV."&lt;ref name="SF Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harwood|first=Seth|title='Gone Girl,' by Gillian Flynn: review |url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gone-Girl-by-Gillian-Flynn-review-3621248.php |accessdate=26 December 2012 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn has also said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of [[bankruptcy]] that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals. Not only have both her main characters lost their jobs, they have also moved to a town that is blighted by unsold houses and failed businesses. "I wanted the whole thing to feel bankrupt ...  I wanted it to really feel like a marriage that had been hollowed out in a city that had been hollowed out and a country that was increasingly hollowed out," said Flynn.&lt;ref name="Rousseau" /&gt;

Amy's "Cool Girl" speech and the vital task of Nick's performing for his media spectators, highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining appearances, however false. Flynn said this: "The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn’t keep it up, so they destroy each other".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Dowd]] (12 October 2014), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-lady-psychopaths-welcome.html Lady psychopaths welcome]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;SR11.&lt;/ref&gt; Amy creates her plan to frame her husband when Nick fails to maintain the false image Amy married, which she feels she is owed for keeping her side of the bargain by pretending to be his "cool girl" fantasy. She only returns to him after he gives a convincing public performance in the role of perfect husband. However, it is not his sincerity she is attracted to, she knows he is putting on an act, but the appearance of it. Amy views Nick as her ideal husband in the end because she knows he must appear to be her ideal husband, permanently, due to her blackmail and the risk of public condemnation. In exchange, she will appear as an ideal wife and mother, a trade Nick accepts. Both prefer the appearance the other projects over the reality of the person they married.

By the end of its first year in publication, ''Gone Girl'' had sold over two million copies in print and digital editions, according to the book's publisher.&lt;ref name=Itzkoff /&gt;

''Gone Girl'' has been widely praised in numerous publications including the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]], [[The New York Times]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], [[Publishers Weekly]], [[Entertainment Weekly]], [[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]], [[People (magazine)|People]],'' and ''[[USA Today]]''. Reviewers express admiration for the novel's suspense, a plot twist involving an unreliable narrator, its psychological dimension, and its examination of a marriage that has become corrosive. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' describes it as "an ingenious and viperish thriller."&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt; ''The New Yorker'' describes it as a "mostly well-crafted novel," praising its depiction of an "unraveling" marriage and a "recession-hit Midwest," while finding its conclusion somewhat "outlandish."&lt;ref&gt;(20 August 2012) {{cite journal|title=Gone Girl: Briefly Noted|journal=New Yorker|date=12 August 2012|volume=88|issue=24|pages=93}} Retrieved with ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' likens Gillian Flynn to acclaimed suspense novelist [[Patricia Highsmith]]. ''Gone Girl'', the ''Times'' goes on to say, is Flynn's "dazzling breakthrough," adding that the novel is "wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated by characters so well imagined that they’re hard to part with."&lt;ref name=Maslin /&gt; A ''USA Today'' review focuses on bookseller enthusiasm for the book, quoting a [[Jackson, Mississippi]] store manager saying, "It will make your head spin off."&lt;ref name="Memmot on sales"&gt;{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Carol|title='Gone Girl' goes over the top in sales, expectations|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2012/10/08/gillian-flynn-gone-girl/1611423/|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''People Magazine''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s review found the novel "a delectable summer read" that burrows "deep into the murkiest corners of the human psyche."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogan|first=Helen|title=Gone Girl|newspaper=People|date=11 June 2012}} Retrieved from MasterFILE Premier using EBSCO.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Chatelaine'' review commends the novel's suspense, its intricately detailed plot and the way it keeps the reader "unnervingly off balance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grassi|first=Laurie|title='Til Death DO US PART|newspaper=Chatelaine|date=December 2012}}Retrieved through EBSCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reviewers have noted the difficulty of writing about ''Gone Girl'', because so little in the first half of the novel is what it seems to be. In his ''Time'' review, Lev Grossman describes the novel as a "house of mirrors." He also writes "Its content may be postmodern, but it takes the form of a thoroughbred thriller about the nature of identity and the terrible secrets that can survive and thrive in even the most intimate relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=My So-Called Wife|newspaper=Time|date=11 June 2012}} Volume 179, issue 23. Retrieved from Academic Search Premier&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], Laura Miller laments that ''Gone Girl'' was conspicuously absent from the winning ranks of prestigious literary awards, like the [[National Book Awards]], and the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. The same article argues that ''Gone Girl'' was snubbed because it belongs to the mystery genre. Judges awarding top literary prizes "have all refrained from honoring any title published within the major genres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=National Book Awards: Genre fiction dissed again|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/11/national_book_awards_genre_fiction_dissed_again/|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gone Girl'' was chosen for the inaugural [[Salon What To Read Awards]] (2012).&lt;ref name="daley2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/12/23/the_what_to_read_awards_top_10_books_of_2012/ |title=The What To Read Awards: Top 10 Books of 2012  |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |author=David Daley |date=December 23, 2012 |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel has also been short-listed for the [[Women's Prize for Fiction]]. Natasha Walter, one of the Women's Prize judges in 2013, told the ''Independent'' that there was considerable debate amongst the judges about the inclusion of ''Gone Girl'' in the finalists' circle. Walter indicated that crime fiction is often "overlooked" by those in a position to make literary commendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Nick |title=Women's Prize for Fiction: Can Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn rob Hilary Mantel of the hat-trick? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/womens-prize-for-fiction-can-gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn-rob-hilary-mantel-of-the-hattrick-8531501.html |accessdate=4 April 2013 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptation ===
{{Main|Gone Girl (film)}}
American actress [[Reese Witherspoon]]'s film production company and [[20th Century Fox]] bought the screen rights to ''Gone Girl'', for which they paid US$1.5 million. The novel's author Gillian Flynn was engaged to write the screenplay. Witherspoon produced the film version along with [[Leslie Dixon]], [[Bruna Papandrea]], and [[Ceán Chaffin]]. Witherspoon was drawn to the script because of its strong female character and its use of multiple perspectives and non-linear structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nordyke |first=Kimberly |title=Hollywood's Most Powerful Authors: Gillian Flynn on Adapting 'Gone Girl,' Being Too 'Wimpy' for Crime Reporting and Her Best Advice to Writers (Q&amp;A) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gone-girl-author-gillian-flynn-395337 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, it was announced that [[David Fincher]] was brought on as director,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=David Fincher in Talks to Direct 'Gone Girl' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-fincher-talks-direct-gone-414316 |accessdate=12 May 2013 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ben Affleck]] cast as Nick and [[Rosamund Pike]] in the role of Amy.

'''Gorani''' (also '''Gurani''') is an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]] of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza-Gorani subroup]] of the [[Western Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian languages]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/zaza-gorani|title=Zaza-Gorani|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=AZGUEQmFqfMC&amp;pg=PA564&amp;lpg=PA564&amp;dq=zaza+gorani+shabak+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rp5HArGnWg&amp;sig=_Qvw1GvO75a5Nb8LOHardxBu-zk&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtyrzi_ZreAhXL2KQKHVtMCIk4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=zaza%20gorani&amp;f=false|title=A Survey of Word Accentual Patterns in the Languages of the World|last=Hulst|first=Harry van der|last2=Goedemans|first2=Rob|last3=Zanten|first3=Ellen van|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110196313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hawrami''' (or Hewrami) is an alternate name of Gorani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hac/21|title=Gurani|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/16/show_language/hac/|title=Ethnologue report for language code: hac|website=www.ethnologue.com|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has similarities with other languages of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza-Gorani]] subgroup of the Northwestern Iranian languages. Gorani is most similar to languages like [[Zaza language|Zazaki]], [[Shabaki language|Shabaki]], [[Bajelani language|Bajelani]] and [[Sarli language|Sarli]].

Gorani or Hawrami is spoken in the southwestern corner of [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|province of Kurdistan]] and northwestern corner of [[Kermanshah Province|province of Kermanshah]] in Iran, and in parts of  the [[Halabja]] region in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and the [[Hawraman]] mountains between [[Iran]] and Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurdish language." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 23 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The oldest literary documents in these related languages, or dialects, are written in Gorani.

Many Gorani speakers belong to the religious grouping [[Yarsan]]ism, with a large number of religious documents written in Gorani.

Gorani was once an important literary language in the parts of Western [[Iran]] but has since been replaced by [[Sorani]].&lt;ref&gt;Meri, Josef W. Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K, index. p 444&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Gorani as a language was slowly replaced by [[Sorani]] in several cities, both in Iran and Iraq. Today, Sorani is the primary language spoken in cities including [[Kirkuk]], [[Meriwan]], and [[Halabja]], which are still considered part of the greater Goran region.

[[Kurd]]s and Gorani speakers themselves tend to consider Gorani as a dialect of [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish group of languages]],&lt;ref&gt;"Kurdish Nationalism and Competing Ethnic Loyalties", Original English version of: "Nationalisme kurde et ethnicités intra-kurdes", Peuples Méditerranéens no. 68–69 (1994), 11-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kehl-Bodrogi, Krisztina. "Syncretistic religious communities in the Near East: Collected Papers of the International Symposium, Alevism in Turkey and Comparable Syncretistic Religious Communities in the Near East in the Past and Present”, Berlin, 14–17 April 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan.

==Etymology==

The name Goran appears to be of [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] origin. The name may be derived from the old [[Avestan]] word, ''gairi'', which means mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/avdict/avdict.htm#dctg|title=Avestan Dictionary|first=Joseph H.|last=Peterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Gorani refers to inhabitants of the mountains or highlanders as the suffix ''-i'' means ''from''. The word has been used to describe mountainous regions and the regions' communities in modern [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] literary texts. In this sense Gorani has the same etymological background as the [[Gorani language (Našinski)|Gorani]] language spoken in the [[Balkans]], which derives from a Slavic word 'gora' also meaning mountainous region. 

The name Horami is believed by some scholars to be derived from God's name in Avestan, [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref&gt;Nyberg, H.S. (1923), The Pahlavi documents of Avroman, Le Monde Oriental, XVII, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Under the independent rulers of Ardalan (9th–14th / 14th–19th century), with their capital latterly at Sanandaj, Gorani became the vehicle of a considerable corpus of poetry. Gorani was and remains the first language of the scriptures of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, or [[Yarsan]]ism, centered on Gahvara. Prose works, in contrast, are hardly known. The structure of Gorani verse is very simple and monotonous. It consists almost entirely of stanzas of two rhyming half-verses of ten syllables each, with no regard to the quantity of syllables.

An example:
دیمای حمد ذات جهان آفرین

"After praise of the Being who created the world

یا وام پی تعریف شای خاور زمین

I have reached a description of the King of the Land of the East.

Names of forty classical poets writing in Gurani are known, but the details of the lives and dates are unknown for the most part.  Perhaps the earliest writer is Mala Parisha, author of a [[masnavi]] of 500 lines on the [[Shi'ite]] faith who is reported to have lived around 1398–99. Other poets are known from the 17th–19th centuries and include Mahzuni, Shaikh Mostafa Takhti, [[Khana Qubadi]], Yusuf Zaka, and Ahmab Beg Komashi.  One of the last great poets to complete a book of poems (divan) in Gurani is Mala Abd-al Rahm of Tawa-Goz south of [[Halabja]].

There exist also a dozen or more long epic or romantic masnavis, mostly translated by anonymous writers from [[Persian literature]] including: [[Bijan and Manijeh]], Khurshid-i Khawar, [[Khosrow and Shirin]], [[Layla and Majnun]], [[Shirin and Farhad]], Haft Khwan-i [[Rostam]] and Sultan Jumjuma.  Manuscripts of these works are currently preserved in the national libraries of [[Berlin]], [[London]], and [[Paris]].

Some Gorani literary works:
* ''Shirin u Xusrew'' by [[Khana Qubadi]] (lived 1700–1759), published 1975 in Bagdad.
* Diwan des Feqe Qadiri Hemewend, 19th century
* The Quran, translated in the 20th century by Haci Nuri Eli Ilahi (Nuri Eli Shah).

==Hawrami==
{{Main article|Hawrami dialects}}
'''Hawrami''' (&lt;span lang="ckb"&gt;هەورامی&lt;/span&gt;; ''&lt;span lang="kmr"&gt;Hewramî&lt;/span&gt;'') also known as '''Avromani''', '''Awromani '''or '''Owrami''', is one of the main groups of dialects of the '''Gorani language''', and is regarded as the most archaic of the Gorani group.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Mackenzie [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avromani-the-dialect-of-avroman-q Avromani], Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly spoken in the [[Hawraman]] region, a mountainous region located in western [[Iran]] ([[Iranian Kurdistan]]) and northeastern [[Iraq]] ([[Iraqi Kurdistan]]). The key cities of this region are [[Paveh|Pawe]] in Iran and [[Halabja]] in Iraq.  Hawrami is sometimes called Auramani or Horami by people foreign to the region.

=== Gorans===
{{main article|Guran (Kurdish tribe)|Kurdish people}}
There are also large communities of people of [[Ahl-e Haqq]] in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The town of [[Ilkhichi]] (İlxıçı), which is located 87&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Tabriz]] is almost entirely populated by [[Yâresân]]is. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} But they are ethnically Turks. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in [[Iranian Kurdistan]]. Both the [[Dersim]] ''([[Zazaki]])'' people and the Gorani people, adhere to a form of ''[[Yazdânism|Yazdanism]]. ''These people are called under the various names, such as [[Ali-Ilahis]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]]. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in all parts of [[Kurdistan]].

{{Hungarian language}}

'''Hungarian''' ({{audio|Hu-magyar_nyelv.ogg|''magyar nyelv''}}) is a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] language spoken in [[Hungary]] and several neighbouring countries. It is the [[official language]] of  Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the [[European Union]]. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] in the countries that today make up [[Slovakia]], western [[Ukraine]] ([[Zakarpattia Oblast|Subcarpathia]]), central and western [[Romania]] ([[Transylvania]]), northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), northern [[Croatia]], and northern [[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje|Mur region]]). It is also spoken by Hungarian [[diaspora]] communities worldwide, especially in [[North America]] (particularly the [[Hungarian Americans|United States]] and Canada) and in Israel. Like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], Hungarian belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]].

==Classification==
{{See also|Regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and other Uralic languages}}
Hungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]] languages of western [[Siberia]] ([[Khanty–Mansia]] region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group.  When the [[Samoyed languages]] were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.&lt;ref name="SalmTax"&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html Salminen, Tapani (2002): ''Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalove, Peter A. (2002) The Classification of the Uralic Languages: Lexical Evidence from Finno-Ugric. In: Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen, vol. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[name of Hungary]] could be a result of regular sound changes of ''Ungrian/Ugrian'', and the fact that the Eastern Slavs referred to Hungarians as ''Ǫgry/Ǫgrove'' (sg. ''Ǫgrinŭ'') seemed to confirm that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lebedynsky | first = Iaroslav | language = French | title = Les Nomades: Les peuples nomades de la steppe des origines aux invasions mongoles |trans-title=The Nomads: the steppe nomad people from origins to Mongol invasions | page = 191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature favors the hypothesis that it comes from the name of the Turkic tribe [[Onogurs|Onogur]] (which means "ten arrows" or "ten tribes").&lt;ref&gt;Sugar, P.F..''A History of Hungary''. University Press, 1996: p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, A.''Magyarization,''' Language Planning and Whorf: The word Uhor as a Case Study in Linguistic Relativism''Multilingua 23: 319, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcantonio, Angela. ''The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics''. Blackwell Publishing, 2002: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;'''

There are numerous regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and the other Ugric languages. For example, Hungarian {{IPA|/aː/}} corresponds to [[Khanty language|Khanty]] {{IPA|/o/}} in certain positions, and Hungarian {{IPA|/h/}} corresponds to Khanty {{IPA|/x/}}, while Hungarian final {{IPA|/z/}} corresponds to Khanty final {{IPA|/t/}}. For example, Hungarian ''ház'' {{IPA-hu|haːz|}} "house" vs. Khanty ''xot'' {{IPA|[xot]}} "house", and Hungarian ''száz'' {{IPA|[saːz]}} "hundred" vs. Khanty ''sot'' {{IPA|[sot]}} "hundred". The distance between the Ugric and Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular.

=== Early classification ===
During the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian. Following an academic debate known as ''Az ugor-török háború'' ("the Ugric-Turkic battle"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, foremost based on work by the German [[linguist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Budenz|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Linguistica Uralica|issue=2/2001|author1-first=Angela|author1-last=Marcantonio|author2-first=Pirjo|author2-last=Nummenaho|author3-first=Michela|author3-last=Salvagni|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va_lu/l37-2-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The "Ugric-Turkic Battle": A Critical Review|accessdate=8 October 2017|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article |History of the Hungarian language}}

===Prehistory===
====Scholarly consensus====
The traditional view holds that the Hungarian language diverged from its [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] relatives in the first half of the [[1st millennium BC|1st millennium {{smallcaps|b.c.}}]], in western [[Siberia]] east of the southern [[Ural mountains|Urals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Uralic Languages |last= Abondolo |first=Daniel |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=1–42 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hungarians]] gradually changed their lifestyle from being settled hunters to being [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]], probably as a result of early contacts with Iranian nomads ([[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]). In Hungarian, Iranian loanwords date back to the time immediately following the breakup of [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] and probably span well over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Uralic Languages |last=Abondolo |first=Daniel |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=453 |chapter=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these include ''tehén'' ‘cow’ (cf. [[Avestan]] ''dhaénu''); ''tíz'' ‘ten’ (cf. Avestan ''dasa''); ''tej'' ‘milk’ (cf. Persian ''dáje'' ‘wet nurse’); and ''nád'' ‘reed’ (from late [[Middle Iranian]]; cf. [[Middle Persian]] ''nāy'').

Archaeological evidence from present day southern [[Bashkortostan]] confirms the existence of Hungarian settlements between the [[Volga River]] and [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Attila Türk, ''A magyar őstörténet és a szaltovói régészeti kultúrkör''. PhD, University of Szeged, 2011 [http://doktori.bibl.u-szeged.hu/1167/].&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Onogurs]] (and [[Bulgar]]s) later had a great influence on the language, especially between the 5th and 9th centuries. This layer of Turkic loans is large and varied (''e.g.'', ''szó'' ‘word’, from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]; ''daru'' ‘crane’, from the related [[Permic languages]]), and includes words borrowed from [[Oghur languages|Oghur Turkic]]; ''e.g.'', ''borjú'' ‘calf’ (cf. [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] ''păru'', ''părăv'' vs. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''buzağı'');&lt;ref&gt;András Róna-Tas &amp; Árpád Berta, ''West Old Turkic: Turkic Loanwords in Hungarian. Part 1: Introduction, A-K'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2011), 151-2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''dél'' ‘noon; south’ (cf. Chuvash ''tĕl'' vs. Turkish dial. ''düš'').&lt;ref&gt;Róna-Tas &amp; Berta, ''WOT'' 2011/1: 291-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many words related to [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary&amp;nbsp;– Early history|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html|work=[[Library of Congress]] (public domain)|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sovereign state|state]] administration and even [[family relationship]]s show evidence of such backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Hungarian [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] and [[grammar]] were not influenced in a similarly dramatic way over these three centuries.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

After the [[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin|arrival of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin]], the language came into contact with a variety of [[Sprachbund|speech communities]], among them [[Slavic people|Slavic]], [[Turkic people|Turkic]], and [[German people|German]]. Turkic loans from this period come mainly from the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cuman people|Cumanians]], who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th centuries; ''e.g.'', ''koboz'' ‘[[cobza]]’ (cf. Turkish ''kopuz'' ‘lute’); ''[[komondor]]'' ‘mop dog’ (&lt; *''kumandur'' &lt; ''Cuman''). Hungarian borrowed many words from neighbouring [[Slavic language]]s; ''e.g.'', ''tégla'' ‘brick’; ''mák'' ‘poppy’; ''karácsony'' ‘Christmas’&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Zaicz, ''Etimológiai szótár: Magyar szavak és toldalékok eredete'', s.v. “karácsony” (Tinta Könyvkiadó, 2006) [http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/hu/tartalom/tinta/TAMOP-4_2_5-09_Etimologiai_szotar/adatok.html]&lt;/ref&gt;). These languages in turn borrowed words from Hungarian; ''e.g.'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ''ašov'' from Hung ''ásó'' ‘spade’. Approximately 1.6 percent of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[lexicon]] is of Hungarian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Vocabularul reprezentativ al limbilor romanice |last=Sala |first=Marius |publisher=Editura Ştiinţifică şi Enciclopedică |year=1988 |location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Schulte, "Loanwords in Romanian", ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' (Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2009), 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative views====

Hungarian [[historian]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Gyula László]] claims that [[geology|geological]] data from [[pollen analysis]] seems to contradict the placing of the ancient Hungarian homeland near the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Gyula, ''The Magyars: Their Life and Civilization'', (1996). On p. 37 he states: “This seemed to be an impeccable conclusion until attention was paid to the actual testimony of tree-pollen analyses, and these showed that the linguists had failed to take into account changes in the vegetation zones over the millennia. After analysis of the plant pollens in the supposed homeland of the Magyars, which were preserved in the soil, it became clear to scientists that the [[taiga]] and [[deciduous forest]]s were only in contact during the second millennium B.C.E., which is much too late to affect Finno-Ugrian history. So the territory sought by the linguists as the location of the putative ‘ancient homeland’ never existed. At 5,000-6,000 B.C.E., the period at which the Uralic era has been dated, the taiga was still thousands of kilometres away from the Ural mountains and the mixed deciduous forest had only just begun its northward advance.”&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts, dismissed by mainstream linguists as [[Pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[English language|English]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Magar language|Magar]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and at least 40 other languages.&lt;ref name="zsirai"&gt;'''Miklós Zsirai''': ''Őstörténeti csodabogarak''. Budapest, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical Controversy over origins====
Today the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] among [[linguist]]s is that Hungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages.

For many years, however, it was a matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]]/[[Uralic language]] or more closely related to the [[Turkic languages]] (a controversy known as the "[[Ugric–Turkish war]]")&lt;ref&gt;elanguage.net/journals/pragmatics/article/download/205/144&lt;/ref&gt;—or whether indeed both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a [[superfamily (linguistics)|superfamily]] of [[Ural–Altaic languages]]. Hungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned [[animal husbandry]] techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash people]], as a high proportion of words specific to [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]] are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian [[burial]] customs. Furthermore, all Ugric languages, not only Hungarian, feature Turkic [[loanword]]s related to [[horse riding]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Old Hungarian===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly [[personal name]] and [[place name]]s, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in [[Old Hungarian script]] have survived, as wood, the [[writing material|medium of writing]] in use at the time, was perishable.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was founded in 1000 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. The country became a [[Western culture|Western]]-styled [[Christian]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) state, with [[Latin script]] replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the [[establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] from 1055, intermingled with [[Latin language|Latin]] text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], which dates to the 1190s. Although the [[orthography]] of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A more extensive body of [[Hungarian literature]] arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian [[Christian poetry|religious poetry]] is the 14th-century ''[[Lamentations of Mary]]''. The first [[Bible translation]] was the [[Hussite Bible]] in the 1430s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The standard language lost its [[diphthongs]], and several [[postposition]]s transformed into [[suffix]]es, including ''reá'' "onto" (the phrase ''utu '''rea''''' "onto the way" found in the 1055 text would later become ''út'''ra'''''). There were also changes in the system of [[vowel harmony]]. At one time, Hungarian used six [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. Today, only two are commonly used (present and past); the future is formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] and is usually not counted as a separate tense.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Modern Hungarian===
[[File:Esztergom Jordánszky-kódex.JPG|thumb|The [[Bible]] in Hungarian]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

In 1533, [[Kraków]] [[printing press|printer]] [[Benedek Komjáti]] published the first Hungarian-language book set in [[movable type]], a translation of the [[Pauline letters|letters of Saint Paul]] entitled ''Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen'' (modern orthography: ''Az Szent Pál levelei magyar nyelven'').{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

By the 17th century, the language already closely resembled its present-day form, although two of the past tenses remained in use. [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman rule]] (1541 to 1699).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the 18th century a group of writers, most notably [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], spearheaded a process of ''nyelvújítás'' ([[language revitalization]]). Some words were shortened (''győzedelem'' &gt; ''győzelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (''e.g.'', ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''dísz'', 'décor'); a wide range of expressions were [[neologism|coined]] using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The 19th and 20th centuries saw further [[Standard language#Standardization|standardization]] of the language, and differences between [[mutually comprehensible]] dialects gradually diminished.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1920, Hungary signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]], losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today the language holds [[official language|official]] status nationally in Hungary and regionally in [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Official status===
[[File:Vojvodina hungarian map.png|thumb|upright=1.36|Official usage of Hungarian language in Vojvodina, Serbia]]
Hungarian is the [[official language]] of Hungary, and thus an official language of the [[European Union]]. Hungarian is also one of the official languages of [[Vojvodina]] and an official language of three municipalities in [[Slovenia]]: [[Hodoš]], [[Dobrovnik]] and [[Lendava]], along with [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Hungarian is officially recognized as a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]], [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] in [[Ukraine]], and [[Slovakia]]. In [[Romania]] it is a recognized minority language used at local level in communes, towns and municipalities with an ethnic Hungarian population of over 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1096369.html|title=Romania: Law Allows Use Of Minority Languages In Public Administration|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
{{main article|Hungarian dialects}}
The [[dialects]] of Hungarian identified by [[Ethnologue]] are: Alföld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King's Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Székely and West Hungarian.  These dialects are, for the most part, [[mutually intelligible]]. The Hungarian [[Csángó]] dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in [[Bacău County]] in eastern Romania. The Csángó Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other [[Hungarian people]], and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.

==Phonology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Hungarian vowel chart with rounded short a.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Hungarian vowels]]
{{Main article|Hungarian phonology}}

Hungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as ''o'' and ''ó''. Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration. However, pairs ''a''/''á'' and ''e''/''é'' differ both in closedness and length.

[[Consonant length]] is also distinctive in Hungarian. Most consonant phonemes can occur as [[Consonant length|geminates]].

The sound [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|/ɟ/}}, written {{angle bracket|gy}}, sounds similar to 'd' in [[British English]] 'duty' (in fact, it is more similar to the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] phoneme 'ѓ' as in 'ѓакон', "deacon", from ''diakon''). It occurs in the name of the country, "Magyarország" (Hungary), pronounced {{IPA|/ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ/}}.

A single 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar tap]] (''akkora'' 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] (''akkorra'' 'by that time'), like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Prosody===
Primary stress is always on the first [[syllable]] of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: ''viszontlátásra'' ("goodbye") is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈvisontˌlaːtaːʃrɒ/}}. Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.

==Grammar==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
{{Main article |Hungarian grammar}}
Hungarian, an [[agglutinative language]], uses various [[affixes]], mainly [[suffixes]] but also some [[prefixes]] and a [[circumfix]], to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.

===Vowel harmony===
Hungarian uses [[vowel harmony]] to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.

===Nouns===
Nouns have a large number of [[Grammatical case|cases]] (between 18 and 35, depending on the definition), but they are generally formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (''az alma'' 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix ''–t'' (''az almát'' '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the 18 cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending –''ból''/''–ből'' meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.

Possession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as  in English (Peter's apple becomes ''Péter almája'', literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with''–k'' (''az almák'' ‘the apples’), but after a numeral, the singular is used (''két alma'' ‘two apples’, literally ‘two apple’; not ''*két almák'').

Unlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and mostly [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], instead of prepositions.

There are two types of [[article (grammar)|articles]] in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives precede nouns (''a piros alma'' 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (''piros'' 'red'), comparative (''pirosabb'' 'redder') and superlative (''a legpirosabb'' 'the reddest').

If the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: ''a piros almák'' 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun:  ''az almák piros'''ak''''' 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): ''Melyik almát kéred?&amp;nbsp;– A piros'''at'''.'' 'Which apple would you like?&amp;nbsp;– The red one'.

===Verbs===
{{See also|Hungarian verbs}}
Verbs are conjugated according to two tenses (past and present), three moods (indicative, conditional and imperative-subjunctive), two numbers (singular or plural), three persons (first, second and third) and definiteness.

The last feature is most characteristic: the definite conjugation is used with a [[transitive verb]] whose (direct) object is definite (''Péter eszi az almát''. "Peter eats the apple".), but the indefinite conjugation either for a verb with an indefinite direct object (''Péter eszik egy almát''. "Peter eats an apple".) or for a verb without an object. (''Péter eszik''. "Peter eats".){{Clarify|date=March 2015|reason=Does Hungarian also have the concept of indirect objects (equating in English to prepositional phrases); and if so, into which class would fall the conjugation of a verb with an indirect, definite object? (&amp;quot;Peter watches for the apple.&amp;quot;)}}
Since conjugation expresses the person and number, personal pronouns are usually omitted except for emphasis.&lt;!-- A definite object usually has the definite article before it (e.g. ''az alma'' ‘the apple’), while an indefinite has the indefinite article (''egy alma'' ‘an apple’), or does not have any articles (this is sometimes used for generalization.) --&gt;

The [[present tense]] is unmarked, and the past is formed by using the suffix&amp;nbsp;–t or –tt: ''hall'' 'hears'; ''hallott'' 'heard', past. Future may be expressed with the present tense (usually with a word defining the time of the event: ''holnap'' 'tomorrow') or by using the auxiliary verb ''fog'' (similar to the English 'will'), followed by the infinitive.

The [[indicative mood]] and the [[conditional mood]] are used both in the present and the past tenses. The conditional past is expressed by using the conjugated past form and the auxiliary word ''volna ''(''hallott volna'' 'would have heard')''.'' The [[imperative mood]] is used only in the present tense.

Verbs have [[verbal prefix]]es, which are also known as [[coverb]]s. Most of them define direction of movement: ''lemegy'' "goes down", ''felmegy'' "goes up". Some verbal prefixes give an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] to the verb, such as the prefix ''meg-'', which generally marks [[telicity]].

Vowel harmony also plays a major role in verb conjugations.  All Hungarian verb conjugations (as well as postpositions and possessive suffixes, for that matter) can be thought of as 'templates' into which vowels are inserted. Based on the nature of a verb's infinitive, which always ends in '-ni', one can create a generic 'template', which has mostly consonants. The vowels are then inserted into the 'template' according to the rules of vowel harmony, based on the categorization of the vowel in the verb root (front, back, rounded, unrounded).

===Word order===
The neutral word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO). However, Hungarian, a [[topic-prominent language]], has a [[word order]] that depends not only on syntax but also on the [[topic-comment]] structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).

A Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.

The topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in "''Az almát János látja".'' ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.

The focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, "Én vagyok az apád". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the pronoun I (''én'') is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.

Although Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.
*János látja az almát. - 'John sees the apple'. Neutral sentence.
*''János'' '''látja''' az almát. - 'John '''sees''' the apple'. (Peter may not see the apple.)
*'''János''' látja az ''almát''. - 'It is John who sees the apple'. (The listener may have thought that it is Peter.)
*''János''''' az almát '''látja. - 'What John sees is the apple'. (It is the apple, not the pear, that John specifically sees. However, Peter may see the pear.)
*''Az almát''''' látja''' János. - 'It is the apple that is seen by John'. (The pear may not be seen by John, but it may be smelled, for example.)
*''Az almát''''' János''' látja. - 'It is by John that the apple is seen'. (It is not seen by Peter, but the pear may be seen by Peter, for example.)

==Politeness==
{{Main article|T–V distinction#Hungarian}}

Hungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:

*''Ön'' (''önözés''): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here "you", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.
*''Maga'' (''magázás'', ''magázódás''): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as ''maga''. Aside from the different [[pronoun]] it is grammatically the same as "''önözés''".
*''Néni/bácsi'' (''tetszikezés''): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as "''önözés''" or "''magázódás''", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role "''tetszik''" ("like") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parent, close friends or close relatives by using "''tetszik''" ("you like"): "''Hogy vagy?''" ("How are you?") here becomes "''Hogy tetszik lenni?''" ("How do you like to be?"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.
*''Te'' (''tegezés'', ''tegeződés'' or ''pertu'', [[per tu]] from [[Latin]]): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address [[God]]. The highest rank, the [[king]], was traditionally addressed "per tu" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of "''tegezés''" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without [[T–V distinction]] [[thou|in most contemporary dialects]]) on the Internet, "''tegezés''" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.

The four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of "''tegeződés''".

Some anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the ''te'' (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop [[IKEA]], whose web site and other publications address the customers in ''te'' form. When a news site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanizsaujsag.hu/hirek/8351/miert-tegezik-a-magyarokat-a-multik/|title=Miért tegezik a magyarokat a multik? - Kanizsa Újság|first=Kanizsa|last=Ujsag|website=Kanizsaujsag.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked IKEA—using the ''te'' form—why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer—using the ''ön'' form—that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France use the most polite (''vous'') form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite ''ön'' form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite ''te'' form.

Giving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define what to call "a word" in [[agglutination|agglutinating]] languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases&lt;ref name="kenesei-p77"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, p. 77)&lt;/ref&gt; (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words&lt;ref name="kenesei-p77" /&gt; and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-nyelv.hu/enyelv.php?page=hir_elem.php~id=41 The first two volumes of the 20-volume series were introduced on 13 November, 2006, at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417043907/http://www.e-nyelv.hu/enyelv.php?page=hir_elem.php~id=41 |date=2008-04-17 }} (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words.&lt;ref name="nadasdy-interview"&gt;[http://2000magyar.mindenkinet.hu/vendegszoba/tudomany/20031126amagyar.html?pIdx=3 "Hungarian is not difficult"] (interview with [[Ádám Nádasdy]])&lt;/ref&gt; (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words,&lt;ref name="kenesei-p86"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, p. 86)&lt;/ref&gt; with an average intellectual using 25–30 thousand words.&lt;ref name="nadasdy-interview" /&gt;) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.&lt;ref name="kenesei-pp76-86"&gt;''A nyelv és a nyelvek'' ("Language and languages"), edited by István Kenesei. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-05-7959-6}}, pp. 76 and 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the Lexicon can be organized using [[word-bushes]]. (See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.

The basic vocabulary shares some hundreds word roots with other [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]]. Examples of such include the verb ''él'' 'live' (Finnish ''elää''&lt;ref name=Helsinki&gt;{{cite web|title="Related words" in Finnish and Hungarian|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html|publisher=Helsinki University Bulletin|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the numbers ''kettő'' 'two', ''három'' 'three', ''négy'' 'four' (cf. [[Mansi language|Mansi]] китыг ''kitig'', хурум ''khurum'', нила ''nila'',
[[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''kaksi, kolme, neljä'',&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''kaks, kolm, neli'', ), as well as ''víz'' 'water', ''kéz'' 'hand', ''vér'' 'blood', ''fej'' 'head' (cf. Finnish&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; and Estonian ''vesi, käsi, veri'', Finnish ''pää'',&lt;ref name=Helsinki/&gt; Estonian ''pea'' or ''pää'').

Words for elementary kinship and nature are more Ugric, less [[Oghur languages|r-Turkic]] and less Slavic. Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers &amp; gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &amp;c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship &amp; religion were, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~lukacs/DETREHUN.htm|title=PROTO-MAGYAR TEXTS FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1st MILLENIUM&lt;!--sic--&gt;?|website=Rmki.kfki.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for a few Latin and Greek loan-words, these differences are unnoticed even by native speakers; the words have been entirely adopted into the Hungarian lexicon. There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.

Another source&lt;ref name="Halukinen-p307"&gt;''The Structure and Development of the Finnish Language'', The Uralic and Altaic Series: 1960–1993 V.1-150, By Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Lauri Hakulinen, Gustav Bayerle, Translated by John R. Krueger, Compiled by Gustav Bayerle, Contributor Denis Sinor, Published by Routledge, 1997
{{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0380-7}}, 383 pages. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.

===Word formation===
Words can be compounds or derived.  Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.

====Compounds====
Compounds have been present in the language since the [[Proto-Uralic]] era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.

A good example is the word ''arc'':

:: ''orr'' (nose) + ''száj'' (mouth) → ''orca'' (face) (colloquial until the end of the 19th century and still in use in some dialects) &gt; ''arc'' (face)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetismeret.hu/?id=3.2 |title=It's written in chapter Testrészek |publisher=Nemzetismeret.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be ''subordinative'': &lt;!-- subordinative is "alárendelő" in Hungarian; it was rather coined by me. I can't find *ANY* reference on this in English. If you can, please translate alárendelő properly. Other "Hunglish" words include subjective, objective, determinative, adjunctive and coordinative. --&gt; the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a [[subjective case|subjective]] one. There are [[objective case|objective]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determinative]], and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]ive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:

: Subjective:
:: ''menny'' (heaven) + ''dörög'' (rumble) → ''mennydörög'' (thundering)
:: ''Nap'' (Sun) + ''sütötte'' (lit by) → ''napsütötte'' (sunlit)
: Objective:
:: ''fa'' (tree, wood) + ''vágó'' (cutter) → ''favágó'' (lumberjack, literally "woodcutter")
: Determinative:
:: ''új'' (new) + ''já'' (modification of ''-vá, -vé'' a suffix meaning "making it to something")  + ''építés'' (construction) → ''újjáépítés'' (reconstruction, literally "making something to be new by construction")
: Adjunctive:
:: ''sárga'' (yellow) + ''réz'' (copper) → ''sárgaréz'' (brass)

According to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more [[syllables]] long  (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.

Other compound words are ''coordinatives'': there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include word duplications (to emphasise the meaning; ''olykor-olykor''
'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: ''gizgaz'', where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix ''giz'' is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, ''hercehurca'' 'complex, obsolete procedures').

A compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:

: ''elme'' [mind; standalone base] + (''gyógy'' [medical] + ''intézet'' [institute]) → ''elmegyógyintézet'' ([[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]])
: (''hadi'' [militarian] + ''fogoly'' [prisoner]) + (''munka'' [work] + ''tábor'' [camp]) → ''hadifogoly-munkatábor'' (work camp of prisoners of war)

===Noteworthy lexical items===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

====Points of the compass====
Hungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the [[Sun]] during the [[day]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]].

*North = észak (from "éj(szaka)", 'night'), as the Sun never shines from the North
*South = dél ('noon'), as the Sun shines from the South at noon
*East = kelet ('rise'), as the Sun rises in the East
*West = nyugat ('set'), as the Sun sets in the West

====Two words for "red"====
&lt;!-- Must this "red" issue really be this long? --&gt;

There are two basic words for "red" in Hungarian: "piros" and "vörös" (variant: "veres"; compare with Estonian "verev" or Finnish "punainen"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English "scarlet" is of "red".) The word "vörös" is related to "vér", meaning "blood" (Finnish and Estonian "veri"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), "vörös" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between "scarlet"  and "red". While many languages have multiple [[colour name|names for this colour]], often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct "[[folk colour]]s".&lt;ref name="basiccolor"&gt;Berlin, B and Kay, P (1969). "Basic Color Terms." Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two words are also used independently of the above in [[collocation]]s. "Piros" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while "vörös" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.

When the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.

Examples:
*Expressions where "red" typically translates to "piros": a red road sign, red traffic lights, the red line of [[Budapest Metro]], red (now called express) bus lines in Budapest, a holiday shown in red in the calendar, ruddy complexion, the red nose of a clown, some red flowers (those of a neutral nature, e.g. tulips), red peppers and paprika, red card suits (hearts and diamonds), red stripes on a flag (but the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and its variants translate to "vörös"), etc.
*Expressions where "red" typically translates to "vörös": [[Red Sea]], [[Red Square]], [[Red Army]], [[Red Baron]], [[Erik the Red]], [[red wine]], red carpet (for receiving important guests), red hair or beard, red lion (the mythical animal), the [[Red Cross]], the novel ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[redshift]], [[red giant]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[red oak]], some red flowers (those with passionate connotations, e.g. roses), red fox, names of ferric and other red minerals, red copper, rust, red phosphorus, the colour of blushing with anger or shame, the red nose of an alcoholic (in contrast with that of a clown, see above), the red posterior of a baboon, red meat, regular onion (not the red onion, which is "lila"), [[litmus test|litmus]] paper (in acid), cities, countries, or other political entities associated with [[leftist]] movements (e.g. [[Red Vienna]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Red Russia]]), etc.

====Kinship terms====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for "sibling": ''testvér'', from ''test'' "body" and ''vér'' "blood"; ''i.e.'', originating from the same body and blood.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ||younger||elder||unspecified&lt;br&gt;relative age
|-
|brother||''öcs&lt;!--yes, it's written as "öcs", not "öccs"--&gt;''||''báty&lt;!-- it is written as "báty", not "bátya" --&gt;''||''fivér'' or&lt;br&gt;''fiútestvér''
|-
|sister||''húg''||''nővér''||''nővér'' or&lt;br&gt;''lánytestvér''
|-
|sibling|| &lt;small&gt;''kistestvér''&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''(nagytestvér)''&lt;/small&gt; ||''testvér''
|}

(There used to be a separate word for "elder sister", ''néne'',&lt;!-- NEM NÉNI, HANEM NÉNE, E-VEL--&gt; but it has become obsolete [except to mean "aunt" in some dialects] and has been replaced by the generic word for "sister".)

In addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:

{| class="wikitable"
|parent||grandparent||great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent||great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent||great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandparent
|great-great-great-great-
grandparent
|-
||''szülő''||''nagyszülő''||''déd(nagy)szülő''||''ük(nagy)szülő''||''szép(nagy)szülő''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ük(nagy)szülő'')
|''ó(nagy)szülő''
(OR ''ük-ük-ük(nagy)szülő)''
|-
|child||grandchild||great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild||great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild||great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild
|great-great-great-great-&lt;br&gt;grandchild
|-
|''gyerek''||''unoka''||''dédunoka''||''ükunoka''||''szépunoka''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ükunoka'')
|''óunoka''&lt;br&gt;(OR ''ük-ük-ükunoka'')
|}

The words for "boy" and "girl" are applied with possessive suffixes. Nevertheless, the terms are differentiated with different declension or lexemes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ||boy/girl||(his/her)&lt;br&gt;son/daughter||(his/her)&lt;br&gt;lover, partner
|-
|male||''fiú''||''fia''||''fiúja/barátja''
|-
|female||''lány''||''lánya''||''barátnője''
|}

''Fia'' is only used in this, irregular possessive form; it has no nominative on its own (see [[inalienable possession]]). However, the word ''fiú'' can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word ''(fiúja)'' will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.

The word ''fiú'' (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming ''fiaiéi'', adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
| fiú || boy
|-
| fia || his/her son
|-
| fiai || his/her sons
|-
| fiáé || his/her son's (singular object)
|-
| fiáéi || his/her son's (plural object)
|-
| fiaié || his/her sons' (singular object)
|-
| fiaiéi || his/her sons' (plural object)
|}

====Extremely long words====
*''megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért''
: Partition to root and suffixes with explanations:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
| meg- || verb prefix; in this case, it means "completed"
|-
| szent || holy (the word root)
|-
| -ség || like English "-ness", as in "holiness"
|-
| -t(e)len || variant of "-tlen", noun suffix expressing the lack of something; like English "-less", as in "useless"
|-
| -ít || constitutes a transitive verb from an adjective
|-
| -het || expresses possibility; somewhat similar to the English modal verbs "may" or "can"
|-
| -(e)tlen || another variant of "-tlen"
|-
| -ség || (see above)
|-
| -es || constitutes an adjective from a noun; like English "-y" as in "witty"
|-
| -ked || attached to an adjective (e.g. "strong"), produces the verb "to pretend to be (strong)" &lt;!-- cf. "okoskodik", "erősködik"; the "-ik" is dropped due to the further suffixes, thus it is better not to mark it in the table --&gt;
|-
| -és || constitutes a noun from a verb; there are various ways this is done in English, e.g. "-ance" in "acceptance"
|-
| -eitek || plural possessive suffix, second-person plural (e.g. "apple" → "your apples", where "your" refers to multiple people)
|-
| -ért || approximately translates to "because of", or in this case simply "for"
|}

: '''Translation:''' "for your [plural] repeated pretending to be indesecrable"&lt;!-- the element "repeated" comes from -ségeskedés-, which can refer to a constant and annoying habit--&gt;

The above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:

* ''legeslegmegszentségteleníttethetetlenebbjeitekként''
:''leges-leg-meg-'''''szent'''''-ség-telen-ít-tet-het-etlen-ebb-je-i-tek-ként''
:"like those of you that are the very least possible to get desecrated"

Words of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see [[agglutinative language]]). They are not compound words—they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root ("szent", saint or holy).
There is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.

The English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably ''[[paprika]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''papar'' "pepper" and the Hungarian diminutive ''-ka''.  The most common however is ''[[Coach (carriage)|coach]]'', from ''kocsi'', originally ''kocsi szekér'' "car from/in the style of [[Kocs]]".  Others are:

* [[shako]], from ''csákó'', from ''csákósüveg'' "peaked cap"
* [[sabre]], from ''szablya''
* [[wikt:heyduck|heyduck]], from ''hajdúk'', plural of ''hajdú'' "brigand"
* [[tolpatch]], from ''talpas'' "foot-soldier", apparently derived from ''talp'' "[[sole (foot)|sole]]".

The Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian runes]], superficially similar in appearance to the better-known [[futhark]] runes but unrelated. When [[Stephen I of Hungary]] established the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practiced by some enthusiasts.

Modern Hungarian is written using an expanded [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents ''(á, é, í, ó, ú)'' to represent long vowels, and umlauts (''ö'' and ''ü'') and their long counterparts [[Double acute accent|''ő'' and ''ű'']] to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) {{angle bracket|ô}} or {{angle bracket|õ}} is used for {{angle bracket|ő}}, and {{angle bracket|û}} for {{angle bracket|ű}}. This is often due to the limitations of the [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page]]. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page]], but this [[code page]] is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both {{angle bracket|ő}} and {{angle bracket|ű}}.) [[Unicode]] includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.

Additionally, the letter pairs [[Hungarian ny|{{angle bracket|ny}}]], [[Hungarian ty|{{angle bracket|ty}}]], and [[Hungarian gy|{{angle bracket|gy}}]] represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/ɟ/}} (a little like the "d+y" sounds in British "''du''ke" or American "woul''d y''ou")&amp;nbsp;– a bit like saying "d" with the tongue pointing to the [[palate]].

Hungarian uses {{angle bracket|s}} for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and [[Hungarian sz|{{angle bracket|sz}}]] for {{IPA|/s/}}, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]] usage. The letter [[Hungarian zs|{{angle bracket|zs}}]] is {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and [[Hungarian cs|{{angle bracket|cs}}]] is {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}. These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter [[Hungarian ly|{{angle bracket|ly}}]] is also a "single letter digraph", but is pronounced like {{IPA|/j/}} (English {{angle bracket|y}}), and appears mostly in old words. The letters [[Hungarian dz|{{angle bracket|dz}}]] and [[Hungarian dzs|{{angle bracket|dzs}}]] {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are ''madzag'' ("string"), ''edzeni'' ("to train (athletically)") and ''dzsungel'' ("jungle").

Sometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: házszám ("street number") = ''ház'' ("house") + ''szám'' ("number"), not an unintelligible ''házs'' + ''zám''.

Hungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, ''lenni'' ("to be"), ''hozzászólás'' ("comment"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: {{angle bracket|sz}} + {{angle bracket|sz}} = {{angbr|ssz}}, e.g. ''művésszel'' ("with an artist"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, ("with a bus"):
:... ''busz-''
:''szal''...

When the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: ''jegy'' + ''gyűrű'' = ''jegygyűrű'' ("engagement/wedding ring", ''jegy'' means "sign", "mark". The term ''jegyben lenni/járni'' means "to be engaged"; ''gyűrű'' means "ring").

Usually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' ("eighteen") is a concatenation of ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling [[minimal pair]]s: ''tol'' ("push") vs. ''toll'' ("feather" or "pen").

While to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and "ly, j" representing {{IPA|/j/}}).

==Word order==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The [[word order]] is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.

===Name order===
{{Main article|Hungarian names}}
The Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.

====Hungarian names in foreign languages====
For clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary&amp;nbsp;– where there is a [[Treaty of Trianon|significant Hungarian population]]&amp;nbsp;– the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.

For an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist, the "father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]" was '''''Teller Ede''''', but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as '''''[[Edward Teller]]'''''. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses ''[[András Schiff]]'' when abroad, not ''Andrew Schiff'' (in Hungarian ''Schiff András''). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.

====Foreign names in Hungarian====
In modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:

*Amikor ''Kiss János'' Los Angelesben volt, látta ''John Travoltá-t.'' (means: When Kiss János was in [[Los Angeles]] he saw John Travolta.)
:The Hungarian name ''Kiss János'' is in the Hungarian name order (''János'' is equivalent to ''John''), but the foreign name ''John Travolta'' remains in the western name order.

Before the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also "Hungarianised": ''Goethe János Farkas'' (originally [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including ''Verne Gyula'' ([[Jules Verne]]), ''Marx Károly'' ([[Karl Marx]]), ''Kolumbusz Kristóf'' ([[Christopher Columbus]], note that it is also translated in English).

Some native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as ''Luther Márton'' ([[Martin Luther]]), ''Husz János'' ([[Jan Hus]]), ''Kálvin János'' ([[John Calvin]]); just like the names of [[monarch]]s, for example the king of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I]] is referred to as ''I. János Károly'' or the queen of the UK, [[Elizabeth II]] is referred to as ''II. Erzsébet''.

[[Japanese names]], which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. ''Kuroszava Akira'' instead of [[Akira Kurosawa]].

====Date and time====
The Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)

The year and day are always written in [[Arabic numerals]], followed by a [[full stop]]. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.

Hours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the [[24-hour clock]] format, but in verbal (and written) communication [[12-hour clock]] format can also be used. See below for usage examples.

Date and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.

*2008. február 9. 16:23:42 ''or'' 2008. február 9., 16:23:42
*2008. febr. 9.
*2008. 02. 09. ''or'' 2008. 2. 9. (rarely)
*2008. II. 9.

Date separated by [[hyphen]] is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here&amp;nbsp;– just like the version separated by full stops&amp;nbsp;– leading zeros are in use.

*2008-02-09

When only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only "displaying" time), these parts can be separated by a [[full stop]] (e.g. "Találkozzunk 10.35-kor."&amp;nbsp;– "Let's meet at 10.35."), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in [[superscript]] (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. "A találkozó 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;-kor kezdődik." ''or'' "A találkozó 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;35&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;-kor kezdődik."&amp;nbsp;– "The meeting begins at 10.35.").

Also, in verbal and written communication it is common to use "délelőtt" (literally "before noon") and "délután" (lit. "after noon") abbreviated as "de." and "du." respectively. Délelőtt and délután is said or written before the time, e.g. "Délután 4 óra van."&amp;nbsp;– "It's 4 p.m.". However e.g. "délelőtt 5 óra" (should mean "5 a.m.") or "délután 10 óra" (should mean "10 p.m.") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead "hajnal" ("dawn"), "reggel" ("morning"), "este" ("evening") and "éjjel" ("night") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says "Reggel 6-kor ettem."&amp;nbsp;– "I had food at ''*morning'' 6.", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says "Hajnali 6-kor még aludtam."&amp;nbsp;– "I was still sleeping at ''*dawn'' 6."). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
!Expression!!Approximate time
|-
|Hajnal||4–6 a.m.
|-
|Reggel||6–9 a.m.
|-
|Délelőtt (de.)||9 a.m.&amp;nbsp;– 12 p.m.
|-
|Dél*||=12 p.m. (="noon")
|-
|Délután (du.)||12–6 p.m.
|-
|Este||6–11 p.m.
|-
|Éjjel||11 p.m.&amp;nbsp;– 4 a.m.
|-
|Éjfél*||=12 a.m. (="midnight")
|}
* * "Dél" and "éjfél" mean these exact times, so using time after them is incorrect. So there is '''no''' "Éjfél 0-kor még buliztunk" ("We were still partying at ''*midnight 0''.") or "Dél 12-kor süt a nap." ("The sun shines at ''*noon 12''."). Instead "Éjfél'''kor''' még buliztunk." and "Dél'''ben''' süt a nap." is correct. (More confusingly, one can say "Dél'''i''' 12-kor süt a nap.", meaning "The sun shines at 12 '''of''' noon.", i.e. "The sun shines at 12, which is the 12 of daytime.") "Délen süt a nap" on the other hand means "The sun shines in the south", as Dél means both noon and south.

==== Addresses ====

Although address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:

'''Budapest, Deák Ferenc tér 1. 1052'''

So the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:

Name of the recipient&lt;br /&gt;
Settlement&lt;br /&gt;
Street address (up to door number if necessary)&lt;br /&gt;
(HU-)postcode

==Vocabulary examples==
''Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word.  The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress.  All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.''

'''''I Dreamed of Africa''''' is a 2000 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Hugh Hudson]], starring [[Kim Basinger]] in her first picture since she co-starred in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' in 1997. It also stars [[Vincent Perez]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Garrett Strommen]], [[Liam Aiken]] and [[Daniel Craig]]. It is based on the [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[I Dreamed of Africa (book)|I Dreamed of Africa]]'' by [[Kuki Gallmann]], an Italian writer who moved to [[Kenya]] and became involved in [[conservation biology|conservation]] work. It was screened in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5136/year/2000.html |title=Festival de Cannes: I Dreamed of Africa |accessdate=2009-10-15|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was both a commercial and critical failure.

==Synopsis==
[[Kuki Gallmann]] ([[Kim Basinger]]), a divorced Italian socialite, changes her life after surviving a car crash. She marries Paolo ([[Vincent Perez]]) a man she doesn't know well and moves with him and her young son to Kenya, where they start a ranch. She faces many problems, both physical and emotional, that will test her.

==Cast==
* [[Kim Basinger]] as [[Kuki Gallmann]]
* [[Vincent Perez]] as Paolo Gallmann
* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Franca
* [[Daniel Craig]] as Declan Fielding
* [[Liam Aiken]] &amp; [[Garrett Strommen]] - Emanuele (age 7 and age 17)
* [[Lance Reddick]] as Simon
* Connie Chiume as Wanjiku

==Soundtrack==
This includes ''"Voi che sapete",'' sung by [[Brigitte Fassbaender]] (mezzo soprano), with the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[István Kertész (conductor)|István Kertész]] conducting, from Act 2 of the opera ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), K. 492, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800022423/cast |title=Cast and Credits: ''I Dreamed of Africa'' (2000) |publisher=Baseline |at=Yahoo! Inc. |accessdate=2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the last films scored by acclaimed composer [[Maurice Jarre]].

==Reception==
The film, on the whole, was not received well, despite praise for Kim Basinger's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basinger, Kim: I Dreamed of Africa | url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=3936&amp;Section=Interviews | publisher = Urban Cinefile | date = 17 Aug 2000 | accessdate = 27 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given a 10% ranking on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 102 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_dreamed_of_africa/ |title=I Dreamed of Africa |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basinger earned a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] (also for ''[[Bless the Child]]'').

It was also a huge financial [[Box office bomb|flop]]; its budget was $50 million while worldwide gross was less than $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = I Dreamed of Africa | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=idreamedofafrica.htm | publisher = Box Office Mojo | date = | accessdate = 27 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inventive spelling''' (sometimes ''invented spelling'')  is the use of [[Convention (norm)|unconventional]] [[spelling]]s of words.

Conventional written English is not [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic]] (that is, it is not written as it sounds, due to the [[English orthography#History|history of its spelling]], which led to outdated, unintuitive, misleading or arbitrary spelling conventions and spellings of individual words) unlike, for example, [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], where letters have relatively fixed associated sounds, so that the written text is a fair representation of the spoken words.

== Overview ==
[[English orthography|English spelling]] is not intuitive and must be learned.  There have been numerous proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdplay.org/reform1.html|title=English Spelling Reform|author1=Alan Beale |author2=Paul Stought |author3=Bob Boden |publisher=Wyrdplay org|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rationalize written English, notably by 
* [[Noah Webster]] in the early 19th century (which is why the [[Webster's Dictionary]] used in the USA varies from the British [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) 
* Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of [[Pitman shorthand]] about 1838, which uses symbols to represent sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken
* Dr. [[John R. Malone]] invented [[Unifon]] in the mid-1950s 
* Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir Isaac) in the early 1960s developed the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]
* Jaber Jabbour in 2012 proposed [[SaypU]], an abbreviated version of the International Phonetic Alphabet adapted for tourism and safety notices, which uses only part of the [[Latin alphabet]]

==In education==
Inventive spelling for children may be encouraged or discouraged by teachers and parents who may believe that expression is more important than accurate orthography or conversely that a failure to correct may lead to difficulty in communicating more complex ideas in later life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Inventive spelling programs may also be known as "words their way" in some schools' curricula.&lt;ref name="Amazon-7770856"&gt;{{cite book |title=Words Their Way: Word Study for Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction |isbn=978-0-13-223968-4 |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=4  |first1=Donald R. |last1=Bear |first2=Marcia |last2=Invernizzi |first3=Shane |last3=Templeton |first4=Francine |last4=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of inventive spelling {{Who|date=December 2017}} have argued that inventive spelling does not produce superior writing skills.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Debate over inventive or invented spelling ===
Samuel Orton pioneered the study of learning disabilities, such as [[dyslexia]]. where the subject is apt to confound the letter-order of words. He and  his assistant [[Anna Gillingham]], an educator and psychologist, evolved the [[Orton-Gillingham]] Approach to reading instruction which is language-based, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible. The Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOEPE) lists about a dozen schools currently committed to this controversial method, which has evolved since about 1935.

More recently, [[Uta Frith]], a developmental psychologist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College, London, has published work concerning spelling difficulties and dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frith, Uta |title=Cognitive Processes in Spelling |publisher=Academic Press |location=London, UK |year=1983|isbn=0-12-268662-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyslexia, whether linked to complex spelling or not, may offer considerable potential for human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dyslexic Advantage: Unlocking the Hidden Potential of the Dyslexic Brain|author=Brock L. Eide M.D. M.A. |publisher=Penguin USA/Plume|year=2011|isbn=978-0-452-29792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gift of Dyslexia|publisher=Penguin USA/Perigee|year=1999|isbn=978-0-399-53566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning theory===

Whether an individual accepts or rejects inventive spelling is a feature of that individual's [[epistemology|theory of learning]]. The debate is closely linked with the debate over [[whole language]] [[literacy]] instruction and [[phonics]] instruction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Theories of supporters====
Those who favor inventive spelling tend to believe in [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], a theoretical perspective on learning (an [[epistemology]]) grounded in [[postmodernism]] and [[holism]].  Constructivists believe that knowledge is created by individuals in a social context.  Because knowledge is cultural, there are no right answers.  In terms of inventive spelling, constructivists are likely to believe that the child is inventing spellings in accord with his or her understanding of language and print.  These spellings are neither right nor wrong; they reflect the child's development as a speller.

====Theories of detractors====
Those who oppose inventive spelling tend to be [[positivism|positivists]] or [[postpositivism|post-positivists]]. Positivists believe that there are correct answers that we can discover based upon [[empirical]] observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They would argue that encouraging inventive spelling is not helpful because there are correct ways to spell that children should learn.

Post-positivists believe that while we cannot know truth completely – our own biases and perspectives prevent that – we can ''approximate'' truth.  Post-positivists might agree with constructivists that an inventive spelling does reflect a child's development but might also argue that there are socially accepted spellings and that children should know these well. This side of the debate was explored further in the book and short film "The deliberate [[dumbing down]] of America".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!-- This section and possibly this entire article uses weasel words and is in dire need of citations. --&gt;

====State of the debate====
Advocates of inventive spelling focus on creativity when children are first learning to spell and write, feel this preserves self-esteem, and thus, feel creativity in spelling is most important.&lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H./ Brinkmann, E. (2012): Supporting individual routes to literacy: Developing concepts and skills before school  by using print in meaningful contexts. Download: https://www.academia.edu/4274843/Supporting_individual_routes_to_literacy_Developing_concepts_and_skills_before_school_by_using_print_in_meaningful_contexts; Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982): Literacy before schooling. Heinemann: Portsmouth/ London (span. 1979); McGee, L.M., &amp; Richgels, D. J. (2012): Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers. Pearson/ Allyn and Bacon: Boston et al. (6th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents counter that creativity is a distraction when learning spelling for the first time, and that children ought to be taught accurate spelling as soon as possible so as not to have incorrect spellings become a habit and delay the learning of accurate spelling.  The overwhelming view from parents {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} is that children learn to spell more quickly and accurately if accurate spelling is the focus instead of creativity when learning words.  Accuracy as the focus in spelling is the manner used in conventional teaching methods and was effectively universal prior to the implementation of 1970s school reform involving whole word literacy and "new math". &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Instruction===

====Inventive spelling instruction====
Pedagogical concepts &lt;ref&gt;e.g. by Brügelmann, H. (1986). ''Discovering print – a process approach to initial reading and writing in West Germany''. In: The Reading Teacher, Vol. 40, No. 3, 294–298; McGee, L. M./ Richgels, D. J. (2000). ''Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers.'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  are based on research studies of early literacy, e.g. by  Emilia Ferreiro &amp; Ana Teberosky, Maryann Manning and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982). ''Literacy before schooling''. Portsmouth/ London: Heinemann (span. 1979); Henderson, E. H./ Beers, J. W. (eds.) (1980). ''Developmental and cognitive aspects of learning to spell: A reflection of word knowledge''. Newark, Del.:  International Reading Association;  Clarke, L.K. (1988). ''Invented vs. traditional spelling in first graders' writings: Effects on learning to spell and read''. In: Research in the Teaching of English, Vol. 22, No. 3 (October), 281–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are encouraged to learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. ''k'', ''a'', ''t'' for the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H. (1999). ''From invention to convention. Children's different routes to literacy. How to teach reading and writing by construction vs. instruction.'' In: Nunes, T. (ed.) (1999). ''Learning to read: An integrated view from research and practice.'' Dordrecht et al.: Kluwer(315–342); Richgels, D.J. (2001). ''Invented spelling, phonemic awareness, and reading and writing instruction.'' In: Neuman, S. B./ Dickinson, D. (eds.) (2001). ''Handbook on Research in Early Literacy for the 21st Century.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings - as long as children from the beginning are confronted with "book spellings", too.

To use [[SIL International]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/ www.sil.org]&lt;/ref&gt; inventive spelling program, there are several instructional principles, as follows: 
* At first, the teachers should accept all of the student's writing as meaningful writing. As students gain more experience, they begin to learn the correct spellings of words and use these spellings in their writings.
* Let the students write freely and independently.
* Ask students to read what they have written.
* Read the text, or repeat the story as if you are reading it.
* Ignore spelling and [[grammar]] errors, unless the students ask to be corrected.
* Rewrite the text if students want you to.
* Help the students to create their own word lists as they write or edit so they can find out the proper spellings.

One aspect of inventive spelling rarely discussed by its advocates is the toll it takes on teachers' time.  Recent studies suggest that to be effective a spelling teacher also must correctly guess what words children meant to use when they invent spellings. The possible deductions are numerous and potentially complicated.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

====Instruction for conventional spelling====

[[Writing]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] are complex cognitive processes of encoding and decoding symbols, of which spelling forms only part.  [[Flashcard|"Look and say"]] form an image of a word without spelling.  [[Spelling#Methods used to teach and learn spelling|Spelling training]] may require children to write out lists of words repeatedly, or engage in competitive [[spelling bee]] tests. Such methods of instruction do not tend to improve students' understanding of the relationship between spelling and pronunciation on any words except those prescribed.

Instruction that emphasizes conventional spelling focuses on the [[phonics]] patterns and rules in English which are anyway intrinsically weak because of the complexity of the [[history of the English language]].  For example, children can be taught that when they hear the {{IPA|/k/}} sound at the end of a one-[[syllable]] word where a [[phonics|short vowel]] precedes the sound, the {{IPA|/k/}} sound will be spelled ''ck'' (as in ''stack'', ''wreck'', ''stick'', ''rock'', and ''stuck'').  A similar pattern holds for the {{IPA|/dʒ/}} sound spelled ''dge'' (as in ''badge'', ''wedge'', ''bridge'', ''lodge'', and ''budge'') and the {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound spelling ''tch''.

The same is also applicable for the process of learning acronyms. It is acceptable to use the inventive spelling of GBOL or ''Jeebol'' which can in turn be written as ''Jeeball''.

Once children learn these phonics patterns, they can apply them to words.  When children make errors, the teacher does not merely tell them they are wrong; the teacher, to the extent possible, returns the child's attention to the relevant rule or pattern.

There are also [[sight word]]s that do not follow patterns; children need to memorize conventional spellings for these words, such as ''who''.

==Benefits and costs==

===Benefits===

Whether teachers encourage children to use inventive spellings or not, analyzing them has several key advantages:
* Children's invented spellings help teachers understand what students know and do not know about the phonetic structure of the language.
* Sophisticated spelling, even if it is not conventional, may indicate strong [[phonological awareness]].
* Examining invented spellings may help researchers understand the development of phonological awareness and understanding of [[sound-symbol correspondence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcrr.org/Curriculum/.../Arndt_IDA2009_StudentsasSpellers.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter0506/Moats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For those teachers who emphasize constructivist, inventive spellings, there are further advantages:
* Children who are allowed to spell inventively may learn an earlier appreciation for [[writing]].
* Children who spell inventively may be more creative in their writing because they focus less on form. They may also use more complicated and precise words that occur in their oral vocabulary but that they do not yet know how to spell, helping them communicate their ideas more fully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/92/7/57.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

The above two suppositions on the benefits of inventive spelling have not been empirically verified and are not generally accepted by neurolinguists, who study the natural learning process of spoken language and have recently determined that reading and spelling are not "hard-wired", natural processes.

===Costs===
Permitting or encouraging children to spell inventively has some costs.
* According to some research, children may learn to spell correctly faster if they are taught to do so in a direct and systematic way.
* Encouraging inventive spelling may delay children's conventional spelling development.
* Early excitement about writing may give way to later frustration when students feel a lack of confidence about their misspellings.
* Some students like to spell things correctly and may resist attempts to get them to spell inventively.
* Practising bad spelling habits ingrains them and makes them difficult to overcome, while spelling correctly from the beginning eliminates this problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30419">The [[Irish language]] originated in Ireland and was historically the dominant language of the Irish people. They took it with them to a number of other countries. In [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]] it gave rise to [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]. It was later carried abroad to other more distant lands in both hemispheres.

In the course of the 19th century English became the dominant vernacular of Ireland, and Irish has since been spoken only by a small minority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed view of the linguistic geography may be found in Fitzgerald, Garret, ‘Estimates for baronies of minimal level of Irish-speaking amongst successive decennial cohorts, 117-1781 to 1861-1871,’ pp.117-155, Volume 84, ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''. Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. His analysis of the 19th century census figures relating to Irish shows that the language remained very strong in the south-west (Munster) and west (Connacht) until towards the end of the century. He remarks, furthermore, that for the decennial periods of 1841-51, 1851-61 and 1861-71, the results are in all likelihood an underestimate (extrapolations included): p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish remains the vehicle of a separate cultural, literary and historical experience, emphasised by purely linguistic differences, since (like other Celtic languages) it is distinctive in structure and vocabulary. Irish was the language that a large number of emigrants took with them from the 17th century (when large-scale emigration, forced or otherwise, became noticeable) to the 19th century.

The Irish diaspora mainly settled in English-speaking countries, chiefly Britain and North America. In some instances the Irish language was retained for several generations. [[Argentina]] was the only non-English-speaking country to which the Irish went in large numbers, and those emigrants came in the 19th century from areas where Irish was already in retreat.

An interest in the language has persisted among a minority in the diaspora countries, and even in countries where there was never a significant Irish presence. This has been shown in the founding of language classes (including some at tertiary level), in the use of the Internet, and in contributions to journalism and literature.

Irish speakers of all social classes were to be found in early modern Britain. Irish beggars were common in 16th century England, and from the late 16th century many unskilled Irish labourers settled in [[Liverpool]], [[Bristol]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Camp, Anthony|authorlink=Anthony J. Camp|title=‘The Irish in England’, in ''Family Tree Magazine''|volume=19|date=2003|pages=8–10|url=http://www.family-tree.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristocratic Irish speakers included the Nugent brothers, members of [[Old English (Ireland)|Ireland's "Old English" community]]: Christopher, 9th Baron Delvin, who wrote an Irish-language primer for [[Elizabeth I]], and William, an Irish language poet who is known to have been at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;De Brún, Pádraig; Ó Buachalla, Breandán; Ó Concheanainn, Tomás (eds.).

Irish speakers were among the Royalist contingents brought over from Ireland during the [[English Civil War]]. Language and cultural differences were partly responsible for the great hostility they encountered in England. Among them were troops commanded by [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin]], who took them with him when he later sided with Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Stoyle, Mark. ''Soldiers and Strangers: An Ethnic History of the English Civil War''. Yale University Press 2005, pp. 62-70. {{ISBN|9780300107005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale Irish immigration, including many Irish speakers, began with the building of canals from the 1780s and of railways in the nineteenth century. More Irish settled in industrial towns in [[Lancashire]] in the late eighteenth century than in any other county. Many Irish were attracted to [[Birmingham]] in the mid-1820s by rapid industrial expansion. The city had large households of Irish speakers, often from the same parts of [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]], [[County Galway|Galway]] and [[County Sligo|Sligo]]. In Manchester a sixth of the family heads were Irish by 1835. By the 1830s Irish speakers were to be found in [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]] and the larger towns of [[South Wales]]. Irish speakers from Roscommon, Galway and Mayo were also to be found in [[Stafford]] from the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Camp, pp. 8-10"&gt;Camp, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s brought an influx of Irish speakers to England, Wales and [[Scotland]]. Many arrived from such counties as Mayo, [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to [[Liverpool]], Bristol, and the towns of South Wales and Lancashire, and often moved on to London. Navvies found work on the South Wales Railway. There are reports of Irish-speaking communities in some quarters of Liverpool in the Famine years (1845–52).&lt;ref&gt;Nic Craith, Máiréad; Leyland, Janet, ‘The Irish language in Britain: A case study of North West England,’ ''Language, Culture and Curriculum'', Volume 10, Issue 3, 1997, pp. 171-185. DOI: 10.1080/07908319709525250&lt;/ref&gt; Irish speakers from Munster were common among London immigrants, with many women speaking little or no English. Around 100,000 Irish had arrived in London by 1851.&lt;ref name="Camp, pp. 8-10"/&gt;

The [[Gaelic Revival]] in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century led to formation of branches of the [[Gaelic League]] abroad, including British cities. There were three branches of the Gaelic League in [[Glasgow]] by 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quotation=”The Gaelic League is making rapid headway in Glasgow. There were only three branches in the city twelve months ago.”|publisher=The Sacred Heart Review|volume=28|date=15 November 1902|url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=BOSTONSH19021115-01.2.57|title=Gaelic Revival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a branch was also founded in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmanchester.com/memories.shtml |title=Irish Manchester |publisher=Irish Manchester |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] there were a large number of Irish working in Britain in the construction industry and as nurses. Many of them, both in provincial towns and in London, were Irish speakers from [[Conamara]] and other [[Gaeltacht]] areas, and Irish was commonly heard on building sites and in dance halls.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Amhlaigh, Dónall.

===London===
[[File:Hogarthgiles.jpg|thumb|right|St Giles in the Fields in the 1730s, as depicted by [[William Hogarth]]]]
Irish immigrants were a notable element of London life from the early seventeenth century. They engaged in seasonal labour and street selling, and became common around [[St Giles in the Fields]] during the eighteenth century, being prominent among the London poor. Many of them were discharged soldiers. The [[Old Bailey]] trial records give a glimpse of the use of Irish in London backstreets, including an instance where a court interpreter was required (1768).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Bailey Proceedings Online: Margaret Flanady, William Flanady, Deception and perjury|date=19 October 1768|quotation=Reference Number: t17681019-45|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org|website=Oldbaileyonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Irish colony was in St Giles in the Fields and [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]]. By the early nineteenth century Irish communities existed in [[Whitechapel]], [[Saffron Hill]], [[Populus|Poplar]] and [[Southwark]], and especially in [[Marylebone]]. Typical occupations were hawking and costermongering. [[Henry Mayhew]] estimated in the 1850s that around 10,000 Irish men and women were so employed. The writer and linguist [[George Borrow]] gives an account (1851) of his father  venturing into the Irish-speaking slums of London in the early years of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/452/452-h/452-h.htm |title=Lavengro |website=Gutenberg.org |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the language was affected by a decline in the number of immigrants. By the middle of the nineteenth century the Irish-born numbered around 109,000 individuals (4.5% of Londoners). By 1861 their number had fallen to 107,000, in 1871 to 91,000, and in 1901 to 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Irish.jsp |title=Communities - Irish London - Central Criminal Court |website=Oldbaileyonline.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaelic League was active in London as elsewhere. The London branch had a number of notable London Irish figures as members, and it was a pioneer in the publication of Irish-language material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nli.ie/pdfs/mss%20lists/150_OBriain.pdf |title=Introduction |website=Nli.ie |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gaelic League of London [Author] |url=http://digital.ucd.ie/view/ivrla:11420 |title=Programme for Feis Lonndan, 1907. - UCD Digital Library |website=Digital.ucd.ie |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish language in contemporary Britain===
The current estimate of fluent Irish speakers permanently resident in Britain is 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cad Chuige An Ghaeilge sa Bhreatain?|year=2011|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaelic League retains a presence in Britain (the current [[Glasgow]] branch was founded in 1895),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnag-glaschu.co.uk/AboutUs.php |title=Conradh Na Gaeilge |website=Cnag-glaschu.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Irish-language organization [[Coláiste na nGael]] and its allies run language classes and other events all over Britain. The areas concerned include London, Essex, Leicestershire and Somerset. There is an active Irish language scene in Manchester with two groups, Conradh na Gaeilge (Manchester branch) and the Manchester Irish Language Group, who have organised an annual arts festival since 2007. The British Association for Irish Studies (established 1985) aims to support Irish cultural activities and the study of Ireland in Britain. This includes promotion of the Irish language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505123221/http://sites.brunel.ac.uk/bais/about ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
{{main|Irish language in Newfoundland}}
Irish people brought the language with them to North America as early as the 17th century (when it is first mentioned). In the 18th century it had many speakers in [[Pennsylvania]]. Immigration from Irish-speaking counties to America was strong throughout the 19th century, particularly after the Famine, and many manuscripts in Irish came with the immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;The cultural and linguistic contexts are discussed in: Ó hAnnracháin, Stiofán (ed.), 1979. ''Go Meiriceá Siar''. An Clóchomhar Tta, Baile Átha Cliath; Ihde, Thomas W. (ed.), 1994. ''The Irish Language in the United States: a historical, sociolinguistic and applied linguistic survey''. Bergin &amp; Garvey. {{ISBN|0-89789-331-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1881 saw the founding of “ {{ill|An Gaodhal|ga}}”, the first newspaper anywhere which was largely in Irish. It continued to be published into the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;The paper and its context are discussed by Fionnuala Uí Fhlannagáin in: Uí Fhlannagáin, Fionnuala, 1990. ''Mícheál Ó Lócháin agus An Gaodhal''. An Clóchomhar Tta, Baile Átha Cliath.&lt;/ref&gt; and now has an on-line successor in ''[[An Gael]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Norton |url=http://www.angaelmagazine.com/ |title=An Gael - Baile |publisher=Angaelmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to "An Gaodhal", many Irish immigrant newspapers in the English language in the 19th and 20th century added Irish language columns. This could most recently be seen with the weekly articles of [[Barra Ó Donnabháin]] in New York's [[Irish Echo]].

Irish has retained some cultural importance in the northeast United States. According to the 2000 Census, 25,661 people in the U.S. spoke Irish at home.&lt;ref&gt;MLA Language Map Data Center, [http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2000&amp;lang_id=635 Irish Gaelic].

Retrieved on 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish language was introduced into [[Newfoundland]] in the late 17th century and [[Irish language in Newfoundland|was widely spoken there]] up until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/language.html |title=Language |publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the only place outside Europe that can claim a unique Irish name (''Talamh an Éisc'', meaning ''Land of the Fish'').

In 2007 a number of Canadian speakers founded the first officially designated "Gaeltacht" outside Ireland in an area near [[Kingston, Ontario]] (see main article [[Permanent North American Gaeltacht]]). Despite its designation, the area has no permanent Irish-speaking inhabitants. The site (named ''Gaeltacht Bhaile na hÉireann'') is located in [[Tamworth, Ontario]], and is to be a retreat centre for Irish-speaking Canadians and Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013171149/http://gaelport.com/index.php?page=clippings&amp;id=1750&amp;viewby=date ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013171143/http://gaelport.com/index.php?page=clippings&amp;id=1661&amp;viewby=date ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Government provides funding for suitably qualified Irish speakers to travel to Canada and the United States to teach the language at universities. This program has been coordinated by the [[Fulbright Commission]] in the United States and the Ireland Canada University Foundation in Canada.

A number of North American universities have full-time lecturers in Modern Irish. These include [[Boston College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Lehman College]]-CUNY, [[New York University]], [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Concordia University in Montreal, [[Elms College]], and most notably the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Two of these institutions offer undergraduate degrees with advanced Irish language coursework, the University of Notre Dame with a BA in Irish Language and Literature and Lehman College-CUNY with a BA in Comparative Literature. Irish language courses are also offered at [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St Michael's College]] in the [[University of Toronto]] and at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] in Newfoundland.

==Australia==
[[File:Newman College - Dining from courtyard.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Newman College (University of Melbourne)|Newman College, University of Melbourne]]: holder of the O'Donnell Collection, an important collection of Irish-language material.]]
The Irish language reached [[Australia]] in 1788, along with English. Irish, when used by [[convict]]s in the early colonial period, was seen as a language of covert opposition, and was therefore viewed with suspicion by colonial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cumann Gaeilge na hAstráile. [http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/docs/history.php The Irish Language in Australia]. Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish constituted a larger proportion of the European population than in any other British colony, and there has been debate about the extent to which Irish was used in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Most Irish immigrants came from counties in the west and south-west where Irish was strong (e.g. [[County Clare]] and [[County Galway]]).

English was essential to the Irish for their integration into public life. Irish, however, retained some cultural and symbolic importance, and the [[Gaelic revival]] was reflected in Australia in the work of local students and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McConville |first=Chris |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/odonnell-nicholas-michael-7879 |title=Biography - Nicholas Michael O'Donnell - Australian Dictionary of Biography |website=Adb.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was taught in several [[Catholic]] schools in [[Melbourne]] in the 1920s, and a bilingual magazine called ''An Gael'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Noone, pp. 123-129.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years a small group of enthusiasts in the major cities continued to cultivate the language.

This brought together for the first time Irish speakers and teachers from all over the country. The language also attracted some wider public attention.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of ''Lingua Franca'' of 26 September 1998, [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/articles/irish.html Why Learn Irish?].

There is presently a network of Irish learners and users spread out across the country. The primary organised groups are the [[Irish Language Association of Australia]] (Cumann Gaeilge na hAstráile), Sydney Irish School and the Canberra Irish Language Association (Cumann Gaeilge Canberra)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=www.cila.org.au |website=Canberra Irish Language Association |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple day courses are available twice a year in the states of Victoria and New South Wales.

==New Zealand==
Irish migration to [[New Zealand]] was strongest in the 1840s, the 1860s (at the time of the gold rush) and the 1870s. These immigrants arrived at a time when the language was still widely spoken in Ireland, particularly in the south-west and west.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Garret, ‘Estimates for baronies of minimal level of Irish-speaking amongst successive decennial cohorts, 117-1781 to 1861-1871,’ Volume 84, ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s the New Zealand Irish included many discharged soldiers: over half those released in [[Auckland]] (the capital) in the period 1845-1846 were Irish, as were 56.8% of those released in the 1860s. There was, however, a fall in Irish immigration from the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jack and Hearn, Terry (2008), ''Settlers: New Zealand Immigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland 1800-1945'', Auckland University Press, pp.60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the Irish clustered in certain occupations, with single women in domestic service and men working as navvies or miners. By the 1930s Irish Catholics were to be found in government service, in transport and in the liquor industry, and assimilation was well advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/irish/6/ |title=Irish - Culture and politics before 1911 - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Irish was influenced by immigrants' local origins, the time of their arrival and the degree to which a sense of Irishness survived. In 1894 the ''New Zealand Tablet'', a [[Catholic]] newspaper, published articles on the study of Irish. In 1895 it was resolved at a meeting in the city of Dunedin that an Irish-language society on the lines of the [[Philo-Celtic Society]] of New York should be established in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;''Gaelic Journal'', 1 June 1894, 1 May 1895, and 1 June 1895; Irish Australian, 16 February 1895; cited in Greg Byrnes, ‘The Gaelic League in Australasia, 1893-1993’, in Rebecca Pelan, assisted by Mark Finnane and Noel Quirke (eds), ''Irish-Australian Studies: Papers delivered at the Seventh Irish-Australian Conference'', July 1993, Sydney, Crossing Press, 1994, 244-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaelic League branches were formed in two New Zealand localities ([[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] and [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]) and items in Irish were published by the Southern Cross of [[Invercargill, New Zealand|Invercargill]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Molloy, ‘Victorians, historians and Irish history: a reading of the New Zealand Tablet 1873-1942,’ pp.153-170 in Brad Patterson (ed.), ''The Irish in New Zealand: Historical Contexts and Perspectives'', Wellington, Stout Centre for New Zealand Studies, 2002, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 Fr William Ganly, a native speaker from the Aran Islands prominent in [[Gaelic Revival]] circles in Melbourne, visited Milton, where he met a large number of Irish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;‘Rev. W. Ganly in New Zealand,’ ''The Advocate'', 14 February 1903, p.19, reprinted from ''New Zealand Tablet'', 5 February 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dwindling of Irish immigration, the decay of the [[Gaeltacht]] in Ireland and the passing of earlier generations were accompanied by a loss of the language. Interest is maintained among an activist minority.

==Argentina==
Between 40,000 and 45,000 Irish emigrants went to [[Argentina]] in the 19th century. Of these, only about 20,000 settled in the country, the remainder returning to Ireland or re-emigrating to North America, Australia and other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Murray, Edmundo|date=2006|title=The Irish Road to South America: Nineteenth-Century Travel Patterns from Ireland to the River Plate|journal=Irish Migration Studies in Latin America|url=http://www.irlandeses.org/road.htm|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 20,000 that remained, between 10,000 and 15,000 left no descendants or lost any link they had to the local Irish community. The nucleus of the Irish-Argentine community therefore consisted of only four to five thousand settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irlandeses.org/settlers.htm |title=Irish Settlers in Argentina |website=Irlandeses.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many came from a quadrangle on the [[County Longford|Longford]]/[[County Westmeath|Westmeath]] border, its perimeter marked by [[Athlone]], [[Edgeworthstown]], [[Mullingar]] and [[Kilbeggan]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;Murray, 'The Irish Road to South America', p.1, from McKenna, Patrick (1992), 'Irish Migration to Argentina' in: O’Sullivan, Patrick (ed.) ''The Irish World Wide: History, Heritage, Identity'', Vol. 1, London and Washington: Leicester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 43.35% of emigrants were from Westmeath, 14.57% from Longford and 15.51% from Wexford.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; Such migrants tended to be younger sons and daughters of the larger tenant farmers and leaseholders, but labourers also came, their fares paid by sheep-farmers seeking skilled shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;Murray,'The Irish Road to South America', p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish census figures for the 19th century give an indication of the percentage of Irish speakers in the areas in question. Allowing for underestimation, it is clear that most immigrants would have been English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Garret, ‘Estimates for baronies of minimal level of Irish-speaking amongst successive decennial cohorts, 117-1781 to 1861-1871,’ pp.153-4. He suggests that, in the light of the Statistical Surveys made in the early 19th century, the observations of reliable contemporary observers and the known deficiencies of the census figures, the percentage figures for Irish speakers may need to be revised upwards.&lt;/ref&gt; Census figures for Westmeath, a major source of Argentinian immigrants, show the following percentages of Irish speakers: 17% in the period 1831-41, 12% in 1841-51, and 8% in 1851-61.

In the 1920s, there came a new wave of immigrants from Ireland, most being educated urban professionals who included a high proportion of Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, ''The Irish Road to South America'', p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that there were many Irish speakers among them.

The persistence of an interest in Irish is indicated by the fact that the [[Buenos Aires]] branch of the Gaelic League was founded as early as 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See '19th Century Irish Emigration to Argentina,' a lecture by Prof. David Barnwell, Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese, Columbia University New York, given at a Columbia University Irish Studies Seminar (undated)|url=http://www.irlandeses.org/argentina.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Irish Migration Studies in Latin America|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be active for several decades thereafter, but evidence is lacking for organised attempts at language maintenance into the present day, though the Fahy Club in Buenos Aires continues to host Irish classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='A la comunidad irlandesa le falta más cohesión,' an interview by Julián Doyle with Fernando (Ferry) O'Killian for ''The Southern Cross''|date=2010|location=Mayo|url=http://www.tsc.com.ar/notacomp.php?id=768/|website=Tsc.com.ar|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temperleyweb.com.ar/celta/killian.htm |title=Ferry O´Killian |website=Temperleyweb.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irish.meetup.com/cities/ar/ |title=Irish Language Meetups - Meetup |website=Irish.meetup.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Upanayanam.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Karnavedham]] of Brahmin boy (both ears pierced)]]
'''Karnavedha''' ({{lang-sa|कर्णवेध}}, {{IAST|Karṇavedha}}) or  '''Karnavedham''' is one of the sixteen major [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|sanskaras]] (sacraments) known as "Shodasha Sanskaras" of [[Sanatana Dharma]].  It is an [[ear piercing]] ceremony that is typically performed between the first and fifth year of life. This can also be performed during later years. &lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.B. (1962, reprint 2003). ''The Hindu Sacraments (Sanskāra)'' in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) ''The Cultural Heritage of India'', Vol.II, Kolkata:The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, {{ISBN|81-85843-03-1}}, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahmins, especially those studying the [[vedas]], usually undergo karnavedha and the other samskaras during the course of their lifetime. The samskaras are mentioned in the  [[Brahmana]] portion of the  [[vedas]]. Some scholars advise that the performance of karnavedha should be considered just as important as [[upanayanam]] (sacred thread ceremony - another major samskara ) and the other sacraments as each holds its own symbolic spiritual value. 

While equally recommended for males and females, in modern times, karnavedha has become an uncommon practice amongst males. 

Karnavedha is considered a vedic rite of passage with symbolic spiritual significance. Some believe that it is intended to open the inner ears for receiving sacred sounds. Hearing of sacred sounds with concentration is considered meritorious in that it cleanses the mind and nurtures the spirit. 

During certain medieval periods, "karnavedha" became associated with religious attire and its performance became obligatory to the extent that its non-performance became regarded as sinful among some communities.

The '''Kwalean languages''' are a small family of [[Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea languages]] spoken in the "[[Bird's Tail]]" (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea. They are sometimes included in a speculative [[Southeast Papuan languages|Southeast Papuan]] branch of Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea (TNG), but the Southeast Papuan families have not been shown to be any more closely related to each other than they are to other TNG families.

The languages are [[Humene language|Humene]]–[[Uare language|Uare]] (Kwale), [[Mulaha language|Mulaha]] (extinct).

==Classification==
Humene and Uare are quite close (70% basic vocabulary), Mulaha more distant (22% with Uare).

The Kwalean family is not accepted by [[Søren Wichmann]] (2013), who splits it into two separate groups, namely [[Humene language|Humene]]–[[Uare language|Uare]] and [[Mulaha language|Mulaha]].&lt;ref name="Wichmann2013"&gt;Wichmann, Søren. 2013.

[[Webcomics]] predate the [[World Wide Web]] and the commercialization of the [[internet]] by a few years, with the first webcomic being published through [[CompuServe]] in 1985. Though webcomics require a larger online community to gain widespread popularity through [[word-of-mouth]], various webcomics pioneered the style of self-publishing in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In ''A History of Webcomics'', cartoonist T. Campbell stated that "few strips from this period are remembered. But a few are notable early explorers of the art form."&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Webcomics|publisher=[[Antarctic Press]]|last=Campbell|first=T.|date=2006-06-08|isbn=0976804395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Webcomics of the 1980s==
[[File:Eric Millikin.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Eric Millikin]] created the first known webcomic.]]

The earliest known online comic was [[Eric Millikin]]'s ''Witches and Stitches'', which he started uploading on [[CompuServe]] in 1985. By self-publishing on the internet, Millikin was able to share his work without having to worry over censorship and demographics.&lt;ref name=WitchStitch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thegauntlet.ca/story/pioneering-page|publisher=''[[Gauntlet (newspaper)|Gauntlet]]''|title=Pioneering the page: The decline of print comics, the growth of webcomics and the flexibility, innovation and controversy of both|last=Dochak|first=Sarah|date=2011-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133117/http://m.thegauntlet.ca/story/pioneering-page|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/09/22-awesome-webcomics.html|publisher=''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''|title=14 Awesome Webcomics To Distract You From Getting Things Done|last=Smith|first=Alexander, K.|date=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Witches and Stitches'' quickly rose to popularity, inspiring other artists to upload their works as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.dailypioneer.com/vivacity/27768-comic-relief.html|publisher=''[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)|The Pioneer]]''|title=Comic Relief|author=Team Viva|date=2011-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114023959/http://www.dailypioneer.com/vivacity/27768-comic-relief.html|archive-date=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Ekaitis' ''[[T.H.E. Fox]]'' was a [[list of furry comics|furry webcomic]] that started in 1986. Initially published on CompuServe, Ekaitis moved on to [[Q-Link]] and [[GEnie]] as the internet grew. Early strips consisted of one panel each and were drawn as [[pixel art]] on a [[Commodore 64]] [[KoalaPad]], first using KoalaPainter, then Advanced OCP Art Studio.&lt;ref name=FoxInterview&gt;{{cite interview|subject = Joe Ekaitis|interviewer = Sherry, accompanied by Lou Schonder|title = Meet Joe Ekaitis&amp;nbsp;— T.H.E.

==Webcomics of the 1990s==
[[File:NetBoy_panel.png|thumb|left|''[[NetBoy]]'' by Stafford Huyler started in 1994.]]

In the early 1990s, cartoonists at various United States universities produced comics through various [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]]. During this period, it was unclear which systems would turn out to be the most successful. Hans Bjordahl, student at the [[University of Colorado]] at the time, started posting ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam (webcomic)|Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' on April 15, 1992 on [[Usenet]], in [[GIF]] and [[PostScript]] format. Sharing the comic through the Internet, its readership extended through a few states. Even in 1995, cartoonist Dominic White published his comics ''The Internet Explorer Kit for the Macintosh'' and ''Slugs'' through [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] rather than the World Wide Web, despite the latter rapidly gaining popularity.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

The first strip of Stafford Huyler's ''[[NetBoy]]'' was uploaded on the World Wide Web in July 1993. Being described as an early example of [[nerd]] humor, the [[stick figure]] comic made frequent references to technical topics most people with an Internet connection at the time would have knowledge of. Huyler later started the spin-off comic ''U.Nox'', about [[system administrator]] Uri Noxen. Despite the small size of Huyler's early ''NetBoy'' comics (10 [[kilobytes]]), the server it was hosted on would crash when the strip got over six visits per second. In response to the webcomic's increasing popularity, Huyler built a stronger server himself. Despite these limitations, Huyler pioneered the concept of [[infinite canvas]], uploading strips in shapes and sizes impossible in print.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

The first strip of David Farley's ''[[Doctor Fun]]'' was uploaded on September 23, 1993. Campbell described ''Doctor Fun'' as the "first regular web comic", as ''NetBoy'' did not have a regular schedule during its first year. Mike Wean's ''Jax &amp; Co.'' was first uploaded in 1994. Using [[Javascript]], it was the first webcomic to implement a "page turning" interface that encourages readers to read the comic in order. Soon, this effect was recreated by simple [[HTML]], such as with ''[[Argon Zark!]]'',&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; which launched in June 1995 and is occasionally listed among the earliest comics to be published on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Crusader /&gt;

Mid-1994, the [[Finnish Comics Society]] launched a collection of webcomics by various authors, initially under the label "NetComics".&lt;ref name=NetComics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchencloset.com/realstuff/ncsa/whats_new-archive/1994/whats-new-9406.html|work=kitchencloset.com|title=What's New With NCSA Mosaic and the WWW|date=1994-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verkko&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaapeli.fi:80/~sarjaks/verkkosk/verkkosk.html|title=VerkkoSarja|author=[[Finnish Comics Society]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970131163830/http://www.kaapeli.fi/~sarjaks/verkkosk/verkkosk.html|archive-date=1997-01-31|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1994, Reinder Dijkhuis started publishing ''[[Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan]]'' on the World Wide Web. The two of these were the first known webcomic created outside of the United States.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-history-of-webcomics/|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]''|title=The History of Webcomics|last=Garrity|first=Shaenon|date=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, an artist going by the name Eerie created a webcomic on [[bulletin board systems]] using [[ANSI art]], titled ''Inspector Dangerfuck''.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangerfuck&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbCMRRD-rAkC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=inspector+dangerfuck&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aGd45UUd5r&amp;sig=gOzhOu3L6bGT3TPr31tgNtQIxCw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=inspector%20dangerfuck&amp;f=false|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|title=Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|last1=Aspray|first1=William|last2=Hayas|first2=Barbara M.|page=298|year=2011|isbn=0262015013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webcomics popular on the internet in January 1995 included ''NetBoy'', ''Aaron A. Aardvark'', and ''The Afterlife of Bob''. At this point, fans of traditional comics such as ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' started sharing such [[copyright]]ed comic strips on the internet.&lt;ref name="The Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19950117&amp;id=LKMaAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5034,965872|title=Internet shows a sense of humor|date=January 17, 1995|journal=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|agency=[[New York Times]]|page=D2|quote=Netboy, the leading cartoon denizen of the Internet ... also ... "Aaron A. Aardvark," "Dr. Fun," "The Afterlife of Bob" and "Where the Buffalo Roam,"}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[1995–99 in webcomics|the end of 1995, there existed hundreds of webcomics]], most of which were derived from [[college newspaper]] comics, and most were short-lived.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

The first major webcomic portal, Big Panda, started in the second half of the 1990s. Big Panda hosted over 770 webcomics, including ''[[Sluggy Freelance]]'' and ''[[User Friendly]]'', which started in 1997. Big Panda's discontinuation resulted in the formation of [[Keenspot]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=850|publisher=''Sequential Tart''|title=A Brief History of Webcomics &amp;mdash; The Third Age of Webcomics, Part One|last=Atchison|first=Lee|date=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, ''[[Dilbert (comic strip)|Dilbert]]'' became the first [[Comic strip syndication|syndicated comic strip]] to be officially published through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2013/10/23/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-reveals-the-simple-formula-that-will-double-your-odds-of-success/#54f98fbd1a3e|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Reveals The Simple Formula That Will Double Your Odds Of Success|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|date=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the genre was popularized by ''[[PvP]]'', the first [[video game webcomic]] was Chris Morisson's ''[[Polymer City Chronicles]]'', which started being published on the World Wide Web in 1995. Three years later, in 1998, Jay Resop started the first [[sprite comic]], ''Neglected Mario Characters''.&lt;ref name=1UP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/strip-games |title=Will Strip for Games |last=Maragos |first=Nich |date=2005-11-07 |publisher=''[[1UP.com|1UP]]'' |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hT7zUBgl?url=http://www.1up.com/features/strip-games |archive-date=2016-05-13 |dead-url=yes |ref=Maragos |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2000, Sean McGuinness started ''[[Twisted Kaiju Theater]]'', which is frequently cited to be the first [[Photonovel|photographic webcomic]].&lt;ref name=Crusader /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitepowdereddoughnuts.com/2006/12/20/sean-mcguinness-legend-among-men-and-monsters/|publisher=''White Powdered Doughnuts''|title=Sean McGuinness, Legend among Men and Monsters|last=Quesada|first=Al|date=2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North-Western Mari alphabet uses all of the letters of the [[Russian alphabet]], plus 7 more: [[ӓ]], [[ҥ]], [[ӧ]], [[Oe (Cyrillic)|ө]], [[ӱ]], [[Oe with diaeresis|ӫ]] and [[ӹ]].  Respectively, these letters represent the phonemes /æ/, /ŋ/, /œ/, /ů/, /y/, /ẙ/ and /ə/.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">The '''Middle Awash''' is an [[archaeological site]] along the [[Awash River]] in [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Afar Depression]]. A number of fossils of the earliest [[hominins]], particularly of the ''[[Australopithecines]]'', as well as some of the oldest known [[Olduwan]] stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], have been found at the site—all of late [[Miocene]], the [[Pliocene]], and the very early [[Pleistocene]] times, that is, about 5.6 million years ago (mya) to 2.5 mya.   &lt;!-----&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archaeology.about.com/library/glossary/bldef_middleawash.htm | title = Middle Awash | work = About.com | accessdate = 2006-04-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051001080544/http://archaeology.about.com/library/glossary/bldef_middleawash.htm | archivedate = 2005-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kipfer | first = Barbara Ann | title = Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology | isbn = 0-306-46158-7 | year = 2000 | publisher = Kluwer Acad./Plenum Publ. | location = New York, NY | origyear = 2000-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;     &lt;!-----&gt;&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Heinzelin | first1 = J | last2 = Clark | first2 = JD | last3 = White | first3 = T | last4 = Hart | first4 = W | last5 = Renne | first5 = P | last6 = Woldegabriel | first6 = G | last7 = Beyene | first7 = Y | last8 = Vrba | first8 = E | title = Environment and behavior of 2.5-million-year-old Bouri hominids | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5414 | pages = 625–9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10213682 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5414.625}}&lt;/ref&gt;    &lt;!-----&gt;It is broadly thought that the divergence of the lines of the earliest [[humans]] (hominins) and of [[chimpanzees]] ([[hominids]]) was completed near the beginning of that time range, or sometime between seven and five mya. However, the larger community of scientists provide several estimates for periods of divergence that imply a greater range for this event, ''see'' [[CHLCA #Current estimates|CHLCA: human-chimpanzee split]].&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/whatshot/2001/wh2001-2.htm | title = Late Miocene hominids from the Middle Awash, Ethiopia | accessdate = 2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent find of ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'' is dated to about 4.2 million years ago, which separates it only 200 thousand years from an earlier fossil of the more primitive ''[[Ardipithecus #Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' (at 4.4 million years ago). ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'' fossils are dated as recent as the very early [[Pleistocene]], or 2.5 mya; fossils of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in the [[Bouri Formation #Dakanihylo|Daka member]] at the site (at 1 mya) and ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' (at 160 ka ago) are found in the middle and late Pleistocene. And patches of fire-baked [[clay]], disputed as evidences of the controlled use of fire, are also found in that later period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bogucki | title = Origins of Human Society | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | isbn = 1-57718-112-3 | year = 1999 | origyear = 1999-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sediment]]s at the site were originally [[Deposition (sediment)|deposited]] in lakes or rivers, and [[carbonate]]s found there contain low [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon isotope]] ratios. This information suggests that the environment of the Middle Awash was wet during the late Miocene, and that this currently arid region was occupied then by [[woodland]] or grassy woodland habitats. Fossil remains of other [[vertebrate]]s found with the hominins, including the [[cane rat]], further suggest such an environment.&lt;ref name="si"/&gt; The region was the site of periodic [[Volcano|volcanism]], which probably created distinct [[ecology|ecological]] regions inhabited by different species of vertebrate animals.&lt;ref name="confex"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004AM/finalprogram/abstract_73652.htm | title = Bimodal volcanism and rift basin development in the Middle Awash region, Ethiopia | accessdate = 2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its purpose is to help recognize and inspire interested students to do more with their creative ability. It also motivates students to join the [[National Art Honor Society]] in high school.&lt;ref name="arteducators"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arteducators.org/community/national-art-honor-societies/learn-more|title=Learn about the National Art Honor Society programs|publisher=National Art Education Association|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of this honor society can submit their own artwork for the NAHS/NJAHS Juried Exhibition at the NAEA Studio &amp; Gallery and can also be published in ''NAHS News''. Students also gain leadership opportunities and overall growth, which can help them with preparation for other responsibilities later in life.&lt;ref name="arteducators2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arteducators.org/community/articles/151-national-art-honor-society-chapter-benefits|title=National Art Honor Society Chapter Benefits |publisher=National Art Education Association|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Formalism''' is an [[architectural style]] that emerged in the United States during the mid 1950s and flowered in the 1960s. Buildings designed in that style exhibited many Classical elements including "strict symmetrical elevations"&lt;ref&gt;Wiffen, Marcus, American Architecture Since 1780: A Guide to the Styles, The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; building proportion and scale, Classical columns, highly stylized [[entablature]]s and colonnades.  The style was used primarily for high-profile cultural, institutional and civic buildings. They were "typically constructed using rich materials such as marble, granite or man-made composites and also incorporated certain qualities of concrete that allowed for the creation of distinctive forms such as umbrella shells, waffle slabs and folded plates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011114909/http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-11|title=Music Center - Architecture and Design of The Music Center|work=musiccenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Durrell Stone]]'s New Delhi American Embassy (1954), which blended the architecture of the east with modern western concepts, is considered to be the symbolic start of New Formalism architecture.&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullertonheritage.org/Resources/archstyles/formalism.htm|title=Architectural Styles in Fullerton: New Formalism|work=fullertonheritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Common features of the New Formalism style, include:
* Use of traditionally rich materials, such as [[travertine]], marble, and granite or man-made materials that mimic their luxurious qualities
* Buildings usually set on a podium
* Designed to achieve modern monumentality
* Embraces classical precedents, such as arches, colonnades, classical columns and entablatures
* Smooth wall surfaces
* Delicacy of details
* Formal landscape; use of pools, fountains, sculpture within a central plaza"&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"/&gt;

The '''Old Chiangmai–Bangkok Sign Language family''' is a [[language family]] of two related [[sign language]]s: [[Old Chiangmai Sign Language]] and [[Old Bangkok Sign Language]].  Woodward (2003) found that they were [[Swadesh list#Sign languages|65% cognate]], indicating that the two languages are related, possibly due to migration between Chiangmai and Bangkok. There appear to be connections to [[Vietnamese sign languages|sign languages of Vietnam]] (especially to [[Hai Phong Sign Language]]), and possibly [[Laotian sign languages]], but the nature of these connections (whether areal or genetic) has not been determined. Village sign languages of Thailand, such as [[Ban Khor Sign Language]], are unrelated.

The '''origin of the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]]''' has been a controversial topic and has been debated over the past decades by historians. The differing opinions mostly revolve around issues such as the home of the earliest ancestors of the medieval Rashtrakutas, a possible southern migration during the early part of the first millennium and the relationship between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan in the 6th century - 7th century. Further, the relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most important and famous dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] of the 8th century - 10th century time period has also been debated. Also contested is whether the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta were related by ancestry to the early [[Kannada]], [[Maratha]], [[Rajput]], [[Reddi]] or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] communities of the Deccan and northern India.

While the history of the early Rashtrakutas has caused much debate, the history of the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] (in present-day [[Gulbarga]]) of the 8th–10th centuries can be accurately constructed because numerous contemporaneous inscriptions and texts refer to them. The crux of the Manyakheta empire extended from the [[Kaveri river]] in the south to the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in the north.  At their peak they were the only south Indian empire that conquered regions in far northern India ([[Kannauj]]) as well as the extreme south ([[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]]). The Lata branch of the empire (in present-day [[Gujarat]]) was an important dynasty belonging to the Manyakheta family line which later merged with the Manyakheta kingdom during the 9th century.

==Research==

===Sources===
The study of the history of the early Rashtrakutas and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been made possible by the availability of numerous inscriptions spread all over the Deccan, ancient literature in [[Pali]],&lt;ref name="pali"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] 1933 p1&lt;/ref&gt; contemporaneous Kannada literature such as ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (850) and ''[[Vikramarjuna Vijaya]]'' (941), Sanskrit writings by Somadeva, Rajashekara, Gunabhadra, Jinasena and others and the notes of Arab travellers of those times such as Suleiman, Ibn Haukal, Al Masudi, Al Istakhri and others.&lt;ref name="improbable1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have left no topic unstudied in an effort to accurately propose the history of the Rashtrakutas. Theories about their lineage (''Surya Vamsa'' or ''Chandra Vamsa''), native region and ancestral home have been proposed using clues from inscriptions, royal emblems, ancient clan names such as "Rashtrika", epithets such as ''Ratta'', ''Rashtrakuta'', ''Lattalura Puravaradhiswara'', names of royalty, coins and contemporaneous literature.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Reu (1933) pp1-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72-74&lt;/ref&gt; These theories from noted scholars have resulted in claims that the Rashtrakutas were from either [[Rajput]],&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;[[John Faithfull Fleet|J. F. Fleet]] (author of ''Dynasties of Canarese Districts of Bombay Presidency'', 1896) in Reu 1933, p6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannadiga]],&lt;ref name="kann"&gt;A.S. Altekar (1934), pp21-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kann1"&gt;S.U. Kamath in Kamath 2001, p72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dal1"&gt;Dalby (1998), p300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ravi1"&gt;Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian (2003), p87&lt;/ref&gt;[[Reddi]],&lt;ref name="red"&gt;A.C. Burnell in Reu 1933, p4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maratha]],&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;C.V. Vaidya (author of ''History of Mediaeval Hindu India : Being a History of India from 600 to 1200 AD'') and D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]&lt;ref name="pun"&gt;Hultzsch and Reu in (Reu 1933, p2, p4)&lt;/ref&gt; origin.

===Epithets===

The appearance of the terms ''Rathika'', ''Ristika'' (''Rashtrika'') or ''Lathika'' in conjunction with the terms ''Kambhoja'' and ''Gandhara'' in some Ashokan inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE from Mansera and Shahbazgarhi in North Western Frontier Province (present day Pakistan), Girnar ([[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]) and Dhavali ([[Orissa, India|Kalinga]]) and the use of the epithet "Ratta" in many later inscriptions has prompted a claim that the earliest Rashtrakutas were descendants of the ''Arattas'', natives of the Punjab region from the time of [[Mahabharata]] who later migrated south and set up kingdoms there,&lt;ref name="arattas"&gt;Hultzsch in Reu 1933, p2&lt;/ref&gt; while another theory points more generally to north western regions of India.&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;J.H.Fleet in (Reu 1933, p6)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this theory, the Arattas may have become natives of the Deccan having arrived there during the early centuries of the first millennium.&lt;ref name="natives"&gt;Reu (1933), p7&lt;/ref&gt;

This is counter to the argument by other scholars that the term ''Rishtika'' used together with ''Petenika'' in the Ashokan inscriptions implied they were hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region&lt;ref name="petenika"&gt;D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "Ratta" implied ''Maharatta'' ruling families from modern Maharashtra region.&lt;ref name="maharatta"&gt;C.V.Vaidya in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; But this has been rejected on the basis that from ancient books such as ''Dipavamsha'' and ''Mahavamsha'' in Pali language it is known the term ''Maharatta'' and not ''Rashtrika'' has been used to signify hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the terms ''Rashtrika'' and ''Petenika'' appear to be two different displaced ruling tribes.&lt;ref name="pali1"&gt;B.N. Reu claims Dr C.V. Vaidya has made an assumption that the Rashtrakutas have lived in the Maharashtra region from the time of King Ashoka simply based on availability of Ashokan inscriptions from that region while inscriptions from other parts of the empire such as Saurashtra, Kalinga and North West also use such clan names. He has further argued that ''Rashtrika'' and ''Petenika'' are not one term but two separate terms in (Reu 1933, p1, p7)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted by another scholar that ruling clans called ''Rathis'' and ''Maharathis'' were in power in parts of present-day Karnataka as well in the early centuries of the Christian era, which is known inscriptions from the region and further proven by the discovery of lead coins from the middle of 3rd century bearing ''Sadakana Kalalaya Maharathi'' in the heart of modern Karnataka region near [[Chitradurga]]. In the face of these facts it is claimed it can no longer be maintained that the ''Rathi'' and ''Maharathi'' families were confined only to present day Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="rathi"&gt;Altekar (1934), pp20-21&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed there is sufficient inscriptional evidence that several ''Maharathi'' families were related to [[Kannadiga]] families by marriage and they were [[Snake|naga]]  worshippers, a form of worship very popular in the Mysore region (modern Karnataka).&lt;ref name="rathi"/&gt; Also, no evidence to confirm that these families were either Aryan or non-Aryan is available.&lt;ref name="aryan"&gt;Altekar (1934), p25&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Ratta'', it is also claimed is a Kannada word from which the word ''Rashtrakuta'' has been derived. The use of the word ''Rattagudlu'' (meaning an office) has been found in inscriptions from present day Andhra Pradesh dated prior to the 8th century indicating it was a South Indian word. From the Deoli plates and Karhad records it is argued there was a prince called Ratta and his son was called Rashtrakuta. Hence it has been argued the Rashtrakutas were of Kannada origin.&lt;ref name="rattagudlu"&gt;A.S. Altekar in Kamath 2001, p73&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said the term  ''Rashtra'' means "kingdom" and ''Kuta'' means "lofty"&lt;ref name="kuta"&gt;Reu (1933), p4&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Rashtra'' means province and ''Kuta'' means chieftain.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Another epithet used in inscriptions of [[Amoghavarsha I]] was ''Lattalura Puravaradhiswara''. It is proposed that it refers to their original home ''Lattalur'', modern day Latur in Maharashtra state, bordering Karnataka.&lt;ref name="Fleet"&gt;J.H. Fleet in Kamath 2001, p72&lt;/ref&gt; This area it is claimed was predominantly Kannada speaking based on surviving vestiges of place names, inscriptions and cultural relics. It is explained that  ''Latta'' is a Prakrit variation of ''Ratta'' and hence Rattana-ur became Lattana-ur and finally Lattalur.&lt;ref name="fleet2"&gt;Altekar (1934), p23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that Latalurapura is modern day Ratnapur in Bilaspur district of central India.&lt;ref name="bilas"&gt;According to Rajvade in Reu 1933, p7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal names and signatures===
In linking possible connections between the medieval Rashtrakuta families to the imperial family of Manyakheta it has been pointed out that only the family members ruling from Elichpur ([[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] or modern [[Amravati district]], modern Maharashtra) had names that were very similar to the names of Kings of the Manyakheta dynasty. From the Tivarkhed and Multhai inscriptions it is clear that the kings of this family were Durgaraja, Govindaraja, Svamikaraja and Nannaraja. These names closely resemble the names of Manyakheta kings or their extended family, the name Govindaraja appearing multiple times among the Manyakheta line. These names also appear in the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas whose family ties with the Manyakheta family is well known.&lt;ref name="names"&gt;Altekar (1934), p8&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their personal names indicating that they were native [[Kannadigas]]. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions in the language of their native home and the race they belonged to.&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;D.R. Bhandarkar in Kamath 2001, p73&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that too in far away Gujarat.&lt;ref name="guj"&gt;Altekar (1934), p21&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that under the rule of the [[Badami]] [[Chalukyas]] of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] (present day [[Vidharba]] region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King [[Dantidurga]], the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;Just as the later Maratha ruling families of Baroda, Indore, and Gwallior used their native language Marathi and script in their personal matters, so did the medieval Rashtrakutas preserve their native language Kannada when ruling from Berar- A.S. Altekar (1934), p22, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblems===
Several Rashtrakuta families ruled India during the 6th century - 7th century period. Scholars have tried to understand their relationship with the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta by a comparative study of the emblems.

The only Rashtrakuta family whose royal emblem is similar to that of the rulers of Manyakheta, the golden eagle or [[Garuda]] ''lanchhana'' (emblem) is that of the family that ruled from Amravathi district of modern [[Maharashtra]].  It has been theorised that this line may possibly have been ancestors of the Manyakheta kings. Their inscriptions (Tivarkhed and Multhai) were issued from Achalapura (modern Elichpur) which may have been their capital. Another Rashtrakuta family ruling from Manapura with its founder King Abhimanyu had the emblem of a lion. This makes it improbable that they were the ancestors of the Manyakheta family.&lt;ref name="improbable1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;Altekar  (1934), p6&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Manapura is uncertain. [[John Faithfull Fleet]] proposed its identification with [[Manpur, Indore|Manpur in Malwa]], and then with [[Manpur, Umaria|Manpur near Bandhavgarh]], but later rejected both these theories himself.&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica (Volume 37, Part 1 - Page 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagawanlal Indraji identified it with Manyakheta (Malkhed) itself. [[Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi]] identified it with [[Maan, Maharashtra|Man, Satara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sueiThBrP4gC&amp;dq=manapura&amp;pg=PA32 |title=Kālidāsa; Date, Life, and Works |author1=Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi  |author2=Narayan Raghunath Navlekar  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Popular |year=1969 |isbn=9788171544684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Garuda is normally indicative Vaishnavite leanings, it has to be observed here that earlier coins belonging to King [[Krishna I]]'s period use the legend ''Parama Maheshwara'', which in turn indicate staunch Shaivite leanings.  This change in symbology has been used to theorise that the Rashtrakutas may have originally been Shaivites and embraced Vaishnavism later.&lt;ref name="shaiva"&gt;The emblem changed from Lion to Garuda later (Reu 1933, p14)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vamsha (genealogy)===
With regards to their ''vamsha'' (whether they belonged to ''Surya Vamsha'' (solar lineage) or ''Chandra Vamsha'' (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta inscriptions remained silent on the issue,  until about 860. Some 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their ''vamsha''.  Of these, only 8 lay claim that they belonged to the [[Yaduvanshi|Yadava]] line. While one inscription of 860 claims that King [[Dantidurga]] was born to the ''Yadava Satyaki'', 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772), his successor calls him ''Parama Mahesvara'' indicating his solar lineage origin and [[Shaiva]] faith.&lt;ref name="krishna1"&gt;Reu (1933), p11&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription of King [[Govinda III]] (808) mentions "by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna". This is considered only a comparative statement.&lt;ref name="krishna"&gt;According to Reu, the Rashtrakutas considered themselves distinct from the Yadava line (Reu 1933, p11)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few records attest to a possible Yadava connection and even the descendants of the Rashtrakutas such as the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, Rathors of Rajasthan claim to be from ''Surya Vamsha'' (solar lineage), a sure sign the Rashtrakutas belonged to the ''Surya Vamsha''.&lt;ref name="vamsha"&gt;Reu 1933, p13-14&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion that the Rashtrakutas did not belong to the Yadava line is supported by another scholar as well.&lt;ref name="yadu"&gt;Altekar (1934), p16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
While the linguistic leanings of the early Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] has been free of such confusion. It is clear from inscriptions, coinage and prolific contemporaneous literature that the court of these Rashtrakutas was multi-lingual, and used [[Sanskrit]] and [[Kannada]] as their administrative languages&lt;ref name="percent"&gt;Pollock (2006), p332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="percent1"&gt;Houben(1996), p215&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged literature in Sanskrit and Kannada.&lt;ref name="dal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="admin"&gt;Kamath (2001), p73&lt;/ref&gt; Rashtrakuta inscriptions outside Karnataka are mostly in Sanskrit&lt;ref name="mas"&gt;Masica (1991), p45-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ravi"&gt;Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas from Lattaluru who encouraged Kannada language (Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p87)&lt;/ref&gt; However this period was the very end of the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Kamath (2001), p89&lt;/ref&gt; As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="kavi1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god1"&gt;Rice, E.P. (1921), p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god2"&gt;Rice, B.L. (1897), p497&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call them the vanquishers of the ''Karnatabala'', a sobriquet used to refer to the near invincibility of the Chalukyas of Badami.  This however it is claimed should not be construed to mean that the Rashtrakutas themselves were not Kannadigas. Their patronage and love of the Kannada language is apparent in that most of their inscriptions within modern Karnataka are in Kannada, while their inscriptions outside of modern Karnataka tended to be in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Karnatabala"&gt;Kamath (2001) p73&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription in classical Kannada of King [[Krishna III]] has also been found as far away as [[Jabalpur]] in modern [[Madhya Pradesh]] which further supports the view of their affinity to the language.&lt;ref name="Karnatabala"/&gt;

[[Adikavi Pampa]], [[Sri Ponna]], [[Shivakotiacharya]] and King [[Amoghavarsha I]] were among the noteworthy scholars in Kannada,&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;Kamath (2001), p90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Apabhramsha]] poet [[Pushpadanta]] wrote several works and famous Sanskrit scholars such as [[Jinasena]] and [[Virasena]] (both of whom were theologians), mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]] and poets such as Trivikrama and Gunabhadra adorned their courts.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp88-89&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Extant literature|extant]] Kannada literature belongs to this time.&lt;ref name="kavi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kavi"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p2,p12,p18&lt;/ref&gt; These Rashtrakuta kings married princess from Northern and Southern India and several Rashtrakuta branches emerged in Northern India during their imperialistic expansion in the 9th century.

The argument that the Rashtrakutas were either Marathi speaking Marathas or Telugu speaking Reddies in origin has been rejected. [[Reddy]]'s in that time period had not come into martial prominence even in the Telugu speaking regions of Andhra, being largely an agrarian society of cultivators who only much later (in the 14th century - 15th century) came to control regions in the Krishna - Rajamundry districts.&lt;ref name="rajmundry"&gt;Altekar (1943), p18&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashtrakuta period did not produce any Marathi inscriptions or literature (with the exception of a 981 CE Shravanabelagola inscription which some historians argue was inscribed later).&lt;ref name="prak"&gt;Altekar (1934), p412&lt;/ref&gt; In addition very few literary works in Prakrit language are available from this period. Jainism which played such an important role in giving patronage to early Kannada literature did not flourish as much in the present day Maharashtra region which is why no Marathi literature emerged during this period. Hence Marathi as the language of the Rashtrakutas, it is claimed, is not an acceptable argument.&lt;ref name="unsustain"&gt;Altekar (1934), p413&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People for Legal and Non-Sectarian Schools''' ('''PLANS''') is an organization based in [[California]] in the [[United States]] which campaigns against the public funding of [[Waldorf Schools|Waldorf]] methods [[charter schools]] alleging they violate the [[United States Constitution]]'s separation of church and state. The group claims independent Waldorf schools and public Waldorf methods charter schools teach [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] content, that this content is religious in nature, and that the schools disguise the anthroposophical content from the public.  PLANS filed federal suit in 1998 against two California public school districts, [[Sacramento City Unified School District]] and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, to halt the Waldorf methods educational programs implemented in two of their schools. The case was ultimately dismissed on its merits in 2012.

The group was founded in 1995 and became a California non-profit corporation in 1997. Its founding officers, president Debra Snell and secretary [[Dan Dugan (audio engineer)|Dan Dugan]] are former Waldorf school parents.  The organization numbered less than 50 members when the lawsuit was brought.&lt;ref&gt;Deposition testimony by Debra Snell, PLANS vs SCUSD, TRESD 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==

The group describes its mission as to

# "Provide parents, teachers, and school boards with views of Waldorf education from outside the cult of Rudolf Steiner."
# "Expose the illegality of public funding for Waldorf school programs in the US."
# "Litigate against schools violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in the US."

== PLANS lawsuit ==

In February 1998, PLANS filed suit against two California public school districts, [[Sacramento City Unified School District]] and [[Twin Ridges Elementary School District]], operating Waldorf-methods schools; one operating a Waldorf-based [[charter school]] and the other operating a Waldorf-based [[magnet school]]. In the complaint, PLANS argued that it was "informed and believes that a primary purpose and primary effect of said operation of Waldorf schools is to advance religion, including the religious doctrines of [[Anthroposophy]]", and as such were acting in violation of the [[1st Amendment|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and Article IX of the [[California Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, filed 2/11/98&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to PLANS' 1999 Motion for Summary Judgement, the Court ruled against their contention that the primary purpose of the program in those schools was to advance religion, finding that the two school districts targeted have a secular, non-religious purpose for implementing Waldorf teaching methods in their schools, but allowed the case to proceed on the second question, whether a primary effect of the programs may be the [[unintended consequence]] of endorsing any religion to an extent that violates the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum and Order", dated 9/24/99, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  As to "primary purpose", see p18 section "i. Secular Purpose", "The question is whether the school districts can articulate any secular purpose for adopting the Waldorf teaching method....PLANS concedes that the school districts have done so, and presents no relevant evidence casting doubt on those articulations." As to "primary effect", see p19 section "ii. Primary Effect", "PLANS has raised a disputed issue of material fact concerning the religious underpinnings of Waldorf education and whether public funding of Waldorf education has the unintended consequence of advancing Anthroposophy."(p22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case dismissed on its merits ===

The trial was scheduled on September 12, 2005, and was expected to run for 16 days. The presiding judge determined two issues to be decided in the trial. The first issue was to determine if anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes - the defendants contended it was not. The second issue, which required first an affirmative ruling that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes, would decide whether the public schools in those two districts were promoting anthroposophy to an extent that violated the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"Third Amended Pretrial Conference Order" dated 4/19/2005, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  p15, "A bench trial is scheduled for September 12, 2005.  The estimated length of trial is sixteen days."  p14, "XVI:Separate Trial of Issues: Trial shall be bifurcated.  Trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion shall precede trial of all remaining issues.  Trial of remaining issues, if necessary, will immediately follow trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial convened as scheduled, but ended in 30 minutes after PLANS failed in their legal burden to present an [[proffer|offer of proof (proffer)]] of evidence sufficient to prove anthroposophy was a religion. PLANS' attorney told the court PLANS could not meet its [[Legal burden of proof|burden]], and that as a result of earlier evidentiary rulings before the court, it could furnish no witnesses at trial to testify anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcript of Court Trial" held 9/12/05 before Judge Frank C. Damrell, Jr., PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  Transcript notes trial commenced at 1:30 p.m. and concluded 2:01 pm. Quotes from transcripts, (The Court): "The Court indicated the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion for establishment causes is indeed the threshold issue.  I have reviewed the trial briefs of the parties, I have looked at the exhibit list and the witness list, and in doing so, as I indicated in the past, I'm going to require a proffer, Mr. Kendall, on that issue."  (Mr. Kendall):"The only witnesses that we would have been able to offer with regard to this question of anthroposophy--I worked on alternative ways of doing it--would be [named].  You've excluded both of those on the grounds I did not disclose them.  I don't think that's the case, but that is the Court's order.  Without those witnesses, I don't believe we'll be able to sustain our burden of proof." (The Court): Then you have no proffer; that's what you're telling me?" (Mr. Kendall): "That's what I'm telling you."  See also [[proffer]].&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS did attempt to introduce one piece of [[documentary evidence]] on the religion issue.  Arguments were heard, but no evidence was presented during the trial. The court ruled that PLANS failed its evidentiary [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], and ordered the case be [[on the merits|dismissed on the merits]].&lt;ref&gt;"Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law", "5. At the trial on September 12, 2005, the court required Plaintiff to make an offer of proof as to how it would prove that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes given its limited exhibits and witnesses. 6. Plaintiff's counsel first stated that he had "no proffer" based on the court's prior ruling...7. Plaintiff's counsel then stated that he had one item of evidence to support Plaintiff's case that anthroposophy is a religion, namely, Plaintiff's Exhibit 89...11. Plaintiff did not proffer any further exhibits or witnesses on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes. 12. Plaintiff rested its case on the threshold issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion...B. Conclusions of Law: 1. Plaintiff failed to carry its evidentiary burden of establishing that anthroposophy is a religion for purposes of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the [constitution].  2.  Plaintiff's only proffered evidence, Exhibit 89, is inadmissible for a variety of reasons.  Plaintiff did not offer any foundation to support admissibility of the Exhibit[], nor did Plaintiff authenticate the Exhibit[].  Moreover, the Exhibit is rank hearsay and is not an "adoptive admission" under the exception to the hearsay rule...IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Plaintiff take nothing, that the action be dismissed on the merits, and that Defendants recover their costs."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision is appealed ===

PLANS filed a notice of appeal of the decision in November, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Civil Appeals Docketing Statement", PLANS, Inc., Plaintiff-Appellant v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, USCA Docket # 05-17193&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal claims that the earlier rulings preventing PLANS from calling two defense expert witnesses for their own [[wiktionary:in chief|case-in-chief]] left them no witnesses able to give evidence that anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Appleant's Opening Brief" {{sic}}, filed 3/13/2006, United States Court of Appeals For the Ninth Circuit, PLANS, Inc. v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, # 05-17193, "The case was bifurcated with the matter of whether or not Anthroposophy was a religion to be tried first.  All of the witnesses PLANS intended to use for this part of the trial had been excluded by the court, and PLANS could not proceed."&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier rulings resulted from pretrial motions submitted six months prior to trial.  The two witnesses PLANS wished to call were first disclosed by the defendants as witnesses against PLANS in the case.&lt;ref&gt;"Amended Pretrial Conference Order", dated 3/16/206, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, # 05-17193, p10, "Plaintiff will not be permitted to call defendant's designated expert witnesses or defendants' previously-designated expert witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS argues in the appeal that an [[Discovery (law)#Rule 26. General Provisions Governing Discovery.3B Duty of Disclosure|automatic disclosure rule]] cited by the judge, though in effect at the time of trial in 2005, was not in effect in 1998 when the case was filed, and claims the witnesses were fully disclosed under the applicable rules.&lt;ref&gt;"Appleant's Opening Brief" {{sic}}, filed 3/13/2006, United States Court of Appeals For the Ninth Circuit, PLANS, Inc. v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District,  # 05-17193, "No party ever disclosed under Rule 26, as this case originated in 1997['''sic'''], when the Eastern District had opted out of Rule 26.  All of the discovery in this case, by all parties, had been conducted through propounded discovery--depositions, interrogatories, admissions, request for production of documents."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case again dismissed on its merits ===
In November 2010, the judge in the case dismissed it on its merits a second time. With the exception of one item, the [[Bylaws]] of the [[Anthroposophical Society]], all of the plaintiff's evidence was either withdrawn before trial or excluded at trial as inadmissible hearsay. The plaintiff called one percipient witness, not friendly to their cause, and no expert witnesses. In his ruling, the judge cited the plaintiff's attempts to elicit from a percipient witness testimony only allowable from an expert witness, and their "complete failure to present percipient testimony relevant to the essential issues in the case" as already sufficient basis for an adverse judgment. He added, however, that aside from the plaintiff's effective failure to present a viable case, "the evidence suggests that anthroposophy is a method of learning which is available to anyone regardless of their religious or philosophical persuasion. Stated another way, anthroposophy is more akin to a methodology or approach to learning as opposed to a religious doctrine or organized set of beliefs." The judge concluded by giving a detailed analysis on the basis of a number of determining factors why anthroposophy should not be judged a religion for [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= PLANS, Inc. v.

=== Case history ===

After its first ruling in 1999, the U.S. District Court—Eastern District of California has issued key rulings on the case in 2001, 2004 and 2005:

* In 2001, the Court dismissed the case. A legal precedent set earlier in a similar case in New York, though not related to Waldorf education, led the Court to find that PLANS lacked grounds to claim [[taxpayer standing]] in the case. After an appeal by PLANS, the US 9th Circuit Appellate Court in February 2003 reversed the decision on taxpayer standing by the lower court, allowing the case to proceed towards trial.&lt;ref&gt;"Appelles' Brief", filed 4/26/2006, PLANS, Inc. Plaintiff and Appellant v Sacramento City Unified School District; Twin Ridges Elementary School District" United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit #05-17193 p5, "On April 6, 2001, School Districts filed a Notice of New Authority citing Altman v Bedford Central Sch. Dist[] based on School Districts' continued belief that PLANS did not have proper taxpayer standing.[]The district court then ordered additional briefing on the question of taxpayer standing.[]As a result, and based on the new authority, the district court entered judgement in favor of School Districts based on PLANS' lack of taxpayer standing. PLANS appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit, claiming that it had taxpayer standing because it alleged the entire curriculum at the schools were inherently religious and thus were akin to a publicly funded Catholic charter school.[]The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's ruling on standing on the basis of the analogy comparing Waldorf methods schools to hypothetical publicly funded Catholic charter schools."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2004, PLANS filed a motion for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication, requesting that the Court rule that anthroposophy is a religion, based on material presented by PLANS.&lt;ref&gt;"Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgement, or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication" dated 6/25/2004, filed 5/28/2004, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, p1 "Notice is given that on June 25, 2004, or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard by the above entitled court, plaintiff will and hereby does move the court for summary judgement on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgement as a matter of law for the reason that, as a matter of law, Anthroposophy is a religion for constitutional purposes under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and that, based on the undisputed material facts and admissions of defendant's employees, the use of the term Waldorf by defendants, the training of teachers at Anthroposophical institutions at public expense, the admitted relationship between Anthroposophy and Waldorf education, the conduct of spiritual events by teachers, and/or curriculum decision s based upon Anthroposophical principles, each independently, and together, create an impermissible advancement of religion and/or excessive entanglement between government and religion.  Plaintiff, therefore, prays for summary judgement and that this court grant its request for a permanent injunction, enjoining the operation of public Waldorf schools, or Waldorf methods schools.  In the alternative, plaintiff prays for summary adjudication on the issue of whether or not Anthroposophy is a religion for the purposes of constitutional analysis under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; But the Court did not accept these arguments, and on 15 November 2004 denied the motion, stating that "triable issues of material fact exist as to whether Anthroposophy is a religion". The Court also provided a new opportunity for both sides to declare witnesses and evidence, with a deadline of January 2005 for disclosure of these.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum and Order" dated 11/15/2004, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, p5 "In order for PLANS to successfully move for summary judgement in this matter, PLANS must prove it is entitled to judgement as a matter of law on two related issues: (1) whether anthroposophy constitutes a "religion" for Establishment Clause purposes; and (2) if anthroposophy is a religion, whether there is anthroposophical curriculum at the two public Waldorf-method schools at issue, thereby constituting a violation of the Establishment Clause.  PLANS has failed to demonstrate that there exists genuine issue as to any material fact on both matters." p9, Conclusion: Triable issues of material fact exist as to whether anthroposophy is a religion, as well as whether the Waldorf method of education implemented at John Morse and Yuba River advances and promotes anthroposophy.  Therefore, PLANS's motion for summary judgment is DENIED"&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2005, the Court issued an order outlining the trial issues and the evidentiary and procedural guidelines for the trial, scheduled for September 12, 2005. The court separated the issues, stating that it would be first necessary to try the question of whether anthroposophy was a religion, and secondly, whether anthroposophy was present in the schools. The order denied PLANS eleven witnesses, for failure by its attorney to make timely disclosure to Defendants, and 105 of PLANS' exhibits, as a result of discovery sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;"Third Amended Pretrial Conference Order" dated 4/19/2005, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266. p14, "Trial shall be bifurcated.  Trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion shall precede trial of all remaining issues.  Trial of remaining issues, if necessary, will immediately follow trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion." p5, "Defendants' Motion In Limine No. 11: The court granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c), defendants' motion to exclude trial witnesses listed by plaintiff who were not disclosed to defendants during discovery.  The following witnesses are excluded from testifying: [11 named].  Defendants' Motion in Limine No 12: The court granted defendants' motion to exclude exhibits listed by plaintiff that were not disclosed to defendants pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).  Pursuant to that ruling, the following exhibits are excluded: Plaintiff's Exhibits Numbers 100-113, 116-118, 120-134, 136-159, 161-169, 171, 174-183, 186-187, 189-192, 194-199, and 201-217."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June, 2009, PLANS' lawyer for the case tendered his "resignation with disciplinary charges pending" from the California Bar;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=166156 California Bar record of disciplinary charges]&lt;/ref&gt; previous disciplinary charges in 2007 and 2008 had cited willful violations of the professional code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/courtDocs/05-O-4079-1.pdf first disciplinary charges], [http://members.calbar.ca.gov/courtDocs/07-O-12385.pdf second disciplinary charges]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August, 2010 the second trial is set to begin in federal court in Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2010/08/02/2929597/public-waldorf-schools-booming.html Public Waldorf Schools Booming in Sacramento] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805053858/http://www.sacbee.com/2010/08/02/2929597/public-waldorf-schools-booming.html |date=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November, 2010 the ruling on the second trial was published, with a finding against the plaintiff (PLANS) and for the defendants.  An appeal was planned with the support of the [[Pacific Justice Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitolweekly.net/pacific-justice-institute-joins-suit-against-waldorf-charter-school/  Pacific Justice Institute joins suit against Waldorf charter school, By Malcolm Maclachlan, 02/14/11]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012, PLANS' appeal was heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The Court affirmed the 2010 ruling and the case was dismissed on its merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2012/06/07/10-17720.pdf|work=D.C.

== History of the public activity of the group ==

PLANS secretary Dan Dugan delivered prepared presentations to various organizations and PLANS distributed packets of prepared print materials to school boards which were at the time considering adopting Waldorf methods in their districts.&lt;ref&gt;Background corporate statement dated 10-25-1999, application for IRS tax exemption.  One such presentation was delivered to the Sacramento Atheists and Other Freethinkers on Jun 9, 1996, and Sacramento Bee's Jan Ferris reported in "Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests" (6/11/1997) that in Sacramento's John Morse Waldorf Methods School's otherwise peaceful first year, some objections to the school were made by Sacramento area atheists protesting the school's inclusion of Old Testament stories and cross-cultural creation myths.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dugan also established a webpage for the organization and moderated a public email discussion list, devoted to topics on the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] curriculum, anthroposophy, and to discussion related to the Waldorf schools.

In February 1996, Dugan delivered a slide presentation to the school board in Twin Ridges Elementary School District.  The district had been operating a Waldorf-methods charter school for two years.  In response to Dugan's presentations, a local committee formed, headed by Baptist pastor, James Morton, and members of the committee argued both in public meetings and through the local media outlets that the school's teachings were in conflict with the US constitution's provision regarding the separation of church and state.  Morton soon joined PLANS and took a place on its governing board.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lauer, "Parents challenge NC charter school", The Union, Feb 27 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deposition of James Morton, PLANS, Inc vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS contacted the [[California Attorney General]] in March 1997, arguing for an investigation into Waldorf Methods public schools statewide, urging the officer to act immediately to end the funding of all such schools.

In April 1997, Dugan delivered arguments against the public funding of Waldorf methods education to a board meeting of the Yuba County Office of Education in Marysville, California.  The county operated two schools for juvenile offenders which were both engaged in an experimental project to develop a nationally-replicable Waldorf-based educational model.  Shortly after this meeting, PLANS set up a picket line at one of the Yuba County Waldorf-based schools.  One of the school's teachers joined the PLANS campaign and became Vice-President of their governing board.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Forward, "Group says teaching methods are religious", ''Appeal-Democrat'', Marysville, CA, May 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1996, PLANS made its first contact with the Sacramento Unified School District to urge district officials there to discontinue their planned Waldorf methods magnet school program. Conversion to the new program was funded in its first two years by a $491,000 federal grant, much of it used to begin training the school's faculty in the Waldorf approach. The magnet program proceeded as planned, and Waldorf methods were adopted at the beginning of the 1996/97 school year at Oak Ridge Elementary School.  A parent survey conducted in the following spring indicated parents were mostly satisfied with this new teaching program.  Attendance improved and none of the enrolled students applied for transfer during the district's "open enrollment" period.  But 11 of the 26 teachers requested transfers from Oak Ridge School - half for personal reasons, and the rest objecting to the Waldorf teacher training or to its educational philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Defendant's response to Interrogatories, PLANS, Inc vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests?", ''Sacramento Bee'', June 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1997, PLANS officials distributed leaflets entitled, "Save Oak Ridge School From the Steiner Cult".

Parents formed a local committee called "Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School".  In May, news media reported that controversial statements had been made by parents during an Oak Ridge meeting, accusing the school of teaching the students about witchcraft, human sacrifices, and religious altars, and charging that the children were being initiated into a cult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080108203216/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/links/story/12266380p-13130448c.html School is teaching witchcraft, critics say] Sacramento Bee, May 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, PLANS held protests in front of the school, and picketers waved flags and anti-Waldorf signs, some demanding the termination of two staff members in the school.

In a newspaper interview in May, Dugan commented on the independent Waldorf school in Davis: "They believe that there are spirits behind everything. I know there are people who would call that evil. (They) would consider anthroposophy a satanic religion."&lt;ref&gt;California Aggie (Davis), 22 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Dugan, described the educators as "misguided", not "evil".&lt;ref&gt;"Davis Primary School Answers Charges of Racism". Robert Shiu, The California Aggie, May 22, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1997, district officials voted unanimously to continue the Waldorf-methods magnet program, but to relocate it to another campus, John Morse Elementary.  PLANS sought legal assistance and found lawyer Scott Kendall, an attorney affiliated with the Christian evangelical legal organization, the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI).&lt;ref&gt;Debra Snell, "Dr. Morton's death a tragic loss", ''The Nevada City Union'' Aug 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The PJI applied for a grant on behalf of PLANS, seeking to raise funds from the evangelical [[Alliance Defense Fund|Alliance Defense Fund (ADF)]] to initiate PLANS' legal suit against public school districts operating Waldorf methods schools. The PJI application alleged the Sacramento school engaged in "Wicca"-based practices, religious proselytizing and coercion, and that a third of the parents had kept their children home from school in protest. A video copy of a local televised news report about the controversy accompanied the application.&lt;ref&gt;ALLIANCE DEFENSE FUND GRANT REQUEST APPLICATION, dated 18 July 1997, made on behalf of PLANS by Pacific Justice Institute and sent to [[Alliance Defense Fund|ADF]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ADF awarded a $15,000 grant in February 1998, and immediately after, PLANS filed suit against Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, demanding a permanent injunction against the implementation of the Waldorf-methods curriculum in the schools, as well as full reimbursement for all legal costs.  PLANS entered into a signed agreement with the Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School, promising the organization that in exchange for their efforts assisting PLANS in the lawsuit, PLANS would share one-fifth of any proceeds awarded in the event of a favorable judgement and "cost multiplier" fines imposed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated Aug 4, 1998, addressed to Tina Means, Concerned Parents of Oak Ridge School, signed by PLANS directors.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000 PLANS hired a private detective to attend a voluntary Winter's Solstice celebration for kindergarten through third-graders that took place in the evening in a privately rented meeting hall.  The detective videotaped the ceremony. PLANS played the tape in a presentation to a school board in Chico, California, as evidence that Waldorf teaching methods are religious.&lt;ref&gt;David Ruenzel, "The Spirit of Waldorf Education", ''Education Week'' Vol. 20, Iss. 41 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ongoing challenges against the Waldorf methods public schools in other districts, PLANS pointedly referenced their pending lawsuit, warning that other districts too would face expensive legal challenges if they allowed Waldorf based methods in any of their schools.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael, "Critic of Waldorf education method urges Chico school board to reject the Blue Oak Charter School", ''Chico Enterprise-Record, Dec 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS' challenges against Waldorf methods charter schools in the Chico Unified and Ross Valley school districts resulted in the denial of pending charter school proposals there.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Isles Nation, "Waldorf-style school stirs controversy", ''Marin Independent Journal'', Aug 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Valley School District board minutes dated Oct 1, 2002 and Oct 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devanie Angel and Laura Smith, "Waldorf critics lose court battle", Chico News and Review, May 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the proponents of those charters soon reapplied in alternative districts nearby and both charters were accepted: the Blue Oaks Charter School, opened September 2001 under Chico's Butte County Office of Education, and the Waldorf-Inspired School of Lagunitas, opened September 2004 in the [[Lagunitas School District]].  Sacramento Unified, Twin Ridges Elementary, and Yuba County districts also continue to operate their Waldorf methods programs. Today, there are 19  public schools in California that have adopted the Waldorf methods.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Moon, "From Acorn to Seedling", ''Chico News and Review'', May 30, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Waldorf style school stirs controversy", ''Marin Independent Journal'', Aug 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Gale, "Lagunitas approves Waldorf school", ''Point Reyes Light'', Mar 25 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of PLANS ==

The Oak Ridge School in Sacramento became the target of threats and accusations that its teachers led children through witchcraft and sorcery practices in the classroom.  While neither of these accusations could be attributed to PLANS, school officials accused PLANS of playing to public prejudices and paranoia, and arousing anxieties in the community by presenting a distorted view of their teachings to the parents of the school, most of whom weren't English proficient.&lt;ref&gt;"Educators Spurn Witchcraft, Cult Allegations by Critics", Sacramento Bee, May 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Local picketers who joined the PLANS protest against Oak Ridge credited the PLANS leaflets as the initial source of their concerns,&lt;ref&gt;"School is teaching witchcraft, critics say", Sacramento Bee May 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the town's newspaper concurred, pointing to data from the school which indicated that since introducing Waldorf methods there had been positive impacts on absenteeism, voluntary re-enrollment, as well as overall parent satisfaction as measured shortly before PLANS' appearance at the school. The paper's editor accused PLANS of alarming parents with claims for which there was no evidence, including the suggestion that Waldorf methods were disguised witchcraft teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080108203204/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/links/story/12266379p-13130444c.html Editorial: The attack on Oak Ridge] Sacramento Bee, June 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school officials in California's Marysville, Twin Ridges, Novato and Butte schools criticized PLANS as well; a principal in the Yuba County District, which was the target of PLANS' protests over their two Waldorf methods schools, expressed outrage over "the lies, the distortion of facts" when questioned by a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;"Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests?", Sacramento Bee, June 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the PLANS lawsuit, the Nevada County superintendent of schools characterized it as "despicable" to have to redirect moneys from teachers and curriculum to pay legal costs, and insisted there was no merit to PLANS' accusations.&lt;ref&gt;David Mirhadi, "Court revives lawsuit against charter school", ''The Union'', Feb 12 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy and expertise of PLANS officials also came under attack during lawsuit witness hearings.  Six of the PLANS board directors and advisors sought to testify as expert witnesses in the case, but each was eliminated due to their lack of expertise on the subjects of anthroposophy and Waldorf education: three were eliminated by the court judge, and the other three subsequently withdrawn voluntarily by PLANS' attorney, Kendall.  After reviewing key sections of the deposition testimony taken of PLANS' most vocal spokesperson, Dugan, the judge expressed "grave doubts about any reliance upon his opinions about anything that has to do with any intellectual endeavor, including anthroposophy" before ruling that Dugan would not be allowed to give testimony in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Reporter's Transcript, PLANS, Inc. vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, Apr 11, 2001 Document #95&lt;/ref&gt;

When PLANS succeeded in convincing board members in Ross Valley and Chico school districts to vote against proposed Waldorf methods charters there, both proposals were welcomed by other school districts nearby, allowing the new schools to go forward.,&lt;ref&gt;Devanie Angel, "County board's taste turns to Waldorf", ''Chico News and Review'', July 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Gale, "Lagunitas approves Waldorf school", ''Point Reyes Light'', Mar 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Local news commentators in one of the targeted communities castigated their local school district for caving to PLANS' threat of a lawsuit, and showcased the episode as one of the most notably "boneheaded or downright wrong things" of the past year.&lt;ref&gt;"What were they thinking?", Chico News &amp; Review, Dec 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anthroposophical Society|Anthroposophical Society in America (ASA)]], which is the legal representative of anthroposophy in the United States, has challenged PLANS over PLANS' characterizations of anthroposophy, as well as PLANS' suggestion that the anthroposophical movement has a direct interest or involvement in the growth of Waldorf teaching methods in the public schools.   These were two claims PLANS made in its May 28, 2004, "Motion for Summary Judgement".  Though not a direct party to the case, the ASA petitioned the court's permission to respond to this trial motion as a ''[[amicus curiae|friend of the court]]''.  The court granted ASA's petition and, in July 2004, the organization submitted an 18-page legal brief to the court challenging PLANS' assertions.&lt;ref&gt;"Amicus Curiae Brief of the Anthroposophical Society in America for the Defendants", PLANS, Inc., v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, July 13, 2004 Document #187&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argumentation by Waldorf methods charter schools and PLANS ==

Advocates of public Waldorf education claim that Waldorf methods (charter) schools should be able to receive public funding. PLANS claims that although Waldorf representatives often state that a public "Waldorf methods" program has been structured so as not to violate the U.S. Constitution, these schools nevertheless have religious underpinnings. Private Waldorf schools celebrate religious festivals and observe religious holidays, for instance. PLANS asserts that in public Waldorf methods schools these activities are not always avoided and are sometimes simply renamed. PLANS alleges that morning verses recited in the public school in which children thank the sun for its warmth are actually prayers, and claim that the sun is a metaphor Steiner used to refer to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080228014720/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid:33641 Schooling the Imagination] Sacramento News and Review, February 03, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In public Waldorf methods schools in the U.S., "God" has been removed from the verse and replaced with "the Sun" to avoid violation of the U.S. Constitution. PLANS claims this is a cosmetic and not a substantive change.

PLANS also claims that not only private, but also public, Waldorf methods schools are anthroposophical institutions. According to PLANS, public Waldorf teachers are required in most cases to take Waldorf teacher training in which they are asked to read works almost exclusively by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, the focus of which are Steiner's tenets of anthroposophy.

The two Waldorf methods public schools PLANS brought to court presented numerous witnesses and introduced documents which contradicted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Court witness statements record numbers #174-181. Also defendant expert witness reports; "FRCP, Rule 26 Report of Dr. Douglas Sloan, Professor Emeritus, Teachers College, Columbia University" filed Sep 27, 2004, and expert witness report of Robert Anderson, Administrator of the Standards and Assessment Office of the California Department of Education, dated Jan 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled that PLANS could not introduce evidence taken in the context of the private and independent Waldorf schools to argue their case against the public Waldorf-methods schools.  The court ruled that private schools are separate entities, and insisted evidence be limited to policies and practices in effect within the litigated public school districts.  The two schools furnished statements and documents in this case showing that the teachers in their Waldorf methods schools were held to the same state mandated training and credential requirements as the teachers in other public schools in those districts.  In response to a demand to prepare a complete list of all Waldorf-related documents and reading materials related to training or instruction in Waldorf teaching methods, neither school district identified a single text written by Rudolf Steiner. Betty Staley, the Rudolf Steiner College staff member who developed the public teacher training program, testified the college's ''1993-1994 Teacher Training Booklists'' did not apply to the public teacher training program, and that only one of the texts from the lists, Steiner's ''Philosophy of Freedom'', was used by the program.&lt;ref&gt;"Deposition of Betty Staley", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, d Apr 23 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In their trial case, PLANS did not repeat their claim that these or other texts by Steiner were required in the public Waldorf-methods teacher training.  However, they did claim that the schools "provide[d] books for its teachers that are filled with Anthroposophical doctrine", and that teachers were "hire[d] because of their Anthroposophical training."&lt;ref&gt;"Second Supplemental Answer to Special Interrogatories", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, Apr 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Staley's testimony, references to spirituality were eliminated from the public Waldorf teachers’ training materials to meet state standards. One teacher who had participated in this program before adopting Waldorf methods in her teaching in the Oak Ridge, and later John Morse schools, reported that Steiner’s philosophy was alluded to in her training and that teachers who wanted to learn more could pay for their own classes, but that most of her colleagues from Morse did not pursue any anthroposophical training in the course of becoming public Waldorf methods teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080228014720/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid:33641 Schooled in spirituality] Article in Sacramento News and Reviews by Chrisanne Beckner, February 03, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS claims the basis of anthroposophy is esoteric Christianity.  In court documents, PLANS argued that Rudolf Steiner considered himself a Christian and that he considered anthroposophy to be a Christian form of theosophy and Rosicrucianism.  PLANS argued that Steiner himself described anthroposophy as a training to access skills of psychic awareness latent in each human being, and argued that the discipline "spiritual science" is not a true science nor philosophy, but a theology.  PLANS acknowledged that Steiner's supporters frequently concede the spiritual foundations of anthroposophy and Waldorf education, but claimed they make a false distinction between ''spiritual'' and ''religious''.  PLANS considered anthroposophy to be part of a New Age religious movement, characterized by its seekers' rejection of orthodoxy and creedal forms of religious expression in favor of a more eclectic and individualized path of spiritual-psychological transformation, a process which PLANS claimed to be generally acknowledged as "religious experience".&lt;ref&gt;Plaintiff's "Answer to Special Interrogatories", pages 3 and 4, (Jan 15, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS wanted the court to agree that Waldorf methods schools lead students through New Age rituals and interpret them as religious practices.  It also wanted the court to agree that in the schools, anthroposophy permeates every subject, and that the underlying theory of the education is based on theology, not philosophy.  In order to do this, PLANS first needed to convince the court that anthroposophy was a religion.  This attempt was unsuccessful, and PLANS seeks to reverse the decision in appeals court.

== Waldorf educators and public Waldorf methods education ==

Some supporters of Waldorf education have suggested that Waldorf education does not belong in government schools. Eugene Schwartz is a prominent teacher and author who has stated that he agreed with Dugan that Waldorf education could not properly be separated from anthroposophy. In Schwartz's view, although Waldorf education is not sectarian, the children are intended to have inwardly religious experiences. In his speech he exemplified this with the way the origin and history of the Jews is taught in grade three in independent Waldorf schools. Schwartz was fired from his position at a teaching college shortly after the speech, and in a later interview, claimed there were many other Waldorf teachers who agreed with him but were afraid to speak out. In Schwartz's opinion, Waldorf education has the goal of making "everything sacramental", and that "willing, feeling, and thinking" are "soul forces" which are intentionally brought to every aspect of the education. Schwartz objected to educators who would reject the movement's religious aspect to suit the requirements of public education. In the interview, Schwartz lamented the fact that, in his view, public Waldorf methods schools are watered-down imitations of authentic Waldorf education.&lt;ref&gt;David Ruenzel, "The Spirit of Waldorf Education", ''Education Week'' Vol. 20, Iss. 41 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz has since become an active promoter of Waldorf education in charter and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Schwartz, [http://www.sopdigitaledition.com/archive/commonground0310/#/56/ "Waldorf Education in the Twenty-First Century"]. ''Common Ground'' March 2010, pp.  54-56&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's Prize''' ({{lang-ko|인민상}}) is a [[North Korea]]n arts and sciences award. It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the [[Cabinet of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ScalapinoLee1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A. Scalapino|author2=Chong-Sik Lee|title=Communism in Korea: The society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2M_yhsWc6gC&amp;pg=PA1395|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02274-4|page=1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean cinema]].

The works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, [[Korean revolutionary opera]], [[acupuncture]] and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.

==History==
The People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.&lt;ref name="Weiser2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chests Full of Brass: A DPRK Political History in Orders, Medals, Prizes, and Titles | last = Weiser | first = Martin  | work = Sino-NK | date = 8 January 2016 | access-date = 16 April 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2016/01/08/chests-full-of-brass-a-dprk-political-history-in-orders-medals-prizes-and-titles/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North Korean feature film ''[[My Hometown (film)|My Hometown]]'' (1949) was directed by [[Kang Hongshik]]. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. [[Kim Il-sung]] praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}''.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}} The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an "excellent textbook" for the workers party.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}}

Some of the works, which did not become recognized as "Immortal classics", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' (1968) directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]], and overseen by [[Kim Jong-il]] himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were ''[[A Flowering Village]]'' and ''[[A Family of Workers]]'' (1971). In the case of the ''A Family of Workers'', Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the [[On the Art of the Cinema#Seed theory|seed theory]].&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Schönherr|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGBog0seMFQC&amp;pg=PA47|date=13 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9052-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K.

In 1965 the [[Chongryon]] established [[Korea University (Japan)|Chosun University]]'s teaching staff in Japan received the prize.&lt;ref name="Chongryon"/&gt;

Many of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. ''[[Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas]]'' is regarded as classic of literature of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.&lt;ref name="KCNA_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200602/news02/04.htm |title=Reminiscences of Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, True Textbook of Life |author= |date=2 February 2006 |website=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Prentiss "Print" Matthews''' (August 27, 1840 &amp;ndash; November 6, 1883) was an American [[sheriff]] and social reformer of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. An advocate for [[African American]] rights in [[Copiah County, Mississippi]], he was murdered while voting in 1883 after defying the orders of local [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] Democrats, who told him not to vote.

==Education and family life==
Matthews, best known by the nickname "Print", was born on August 27, 1840,near [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi|Hazlehurst]], [[Mississippi]], the Copiah County seat.

==Career==
Although his parents were wealthy and owned 35 slaves. Matthews supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. During the [[American Civil War]], most local whites supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

After the war, Matthews ran a store and was elected the county sheriff. When [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained power in the state government in 1875, Matthews helped organize the Independent Party in Copiah County, consisting of black and white farmers. However, in 1881, Democrats began night riding to intimidate African Americans and attempt to suppress their voting, and Matthews lost his bid for re-election by 84 votes, as Democrats claimed a mule had reached through a window and eaten all the ballots from Mt. Hope precinct, primarily African American and supportive of Matthews (although 2 blacks remained on the county council).&lt;ref&gt;James Loewen, Lies across America: What our Historic Sites get Wrong (New York: the New Press, 1999) pp. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the night rides grew worse, although the Independent Party slate only included one black. Ablack church was burned and a husband and wife murdered on October 26. The riders ordered voters not to vote for the Independent Party in the upcoming 1883 elections; and blacks and some whites even spent the night before the election in the woods for fear of further intimidation tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The white Democratic leaders of Hazlehurst delivered a written ultimatum to Matthews, ordering him not to vote. When he persisted, the precinct captain, a white farmer and doctor named [[Erastus Benjamin Wheeler]] (1840-1900, nicknamed "Ras") who had an account at Matthews' store, reached inside a wooden box for a double-barreled shotgun and shot and killed Matthews at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=pboJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=The+Republican+Campaign+Textbook+Print+Matthews ''The Republican Campaign Textbook for 1884''], New York: Republican National Committee, 1884; pp. 156–160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepastwhispers.com/ALHN_Copiah_County.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening after his murder, Matthews' political enemies, organized in a local group known as the "Trail-Hold Club", gathered in the yard of his residence. They mocked and celebrated the killing.&lt;ref name=Flower&gt;Frank Abial Flower, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VmkFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;dq=print+matthews+1883+copiah&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=print%20matthews%201883%20copiah&amp;f=false ''History of the Republican Party: Embracing Its Origin, Growth and Mission''], Grand Rapids, MI: Union Book Company, 1884; pg. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; A mass meeting "resolved" that the Matthews family "shall keep out of politics in Copiah county" and some talked of having Wheeler run for governor. Wheeler was elected marshal of Hazlehurst, Meanwhile, the gravedigger who had helped bury Matthews on his own property was threatened and left town, as did the Matthews family (though some members including his then-15 year old son later returned).&lt;ref&gt;Lowen p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
After a special investigation, Wheeler was tried in May 1884. The ''New York Times'' covered the trial. The carefully chosen, all-white jury quickly returned a verdict of not guilty, much to the pleasure and expectation of the judge and the community. The jury posted a statement noting that if an "error" occurred, it was "one of the head, and not of the heart."

J.T. Dameron, a merchant, testified that he saw Ras Wheeler in a street car in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on the 13th or 14th of February. He said that Wheeler was talking in a low tone. He said; "Yes, old [[Samuel Hoar|Hoar]] is coming down here on an investigation committee. If I get a crack at him I will kill him, too. I killed Print Matthews, or rather it was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] that did it. If it had not been for politics, I would not have done it; but it was politics that did it."&lt;ref name=Flower /&gt;

Ras Wheeler went on to have a successful political career in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E7D6113BE033A25757C1A9639C94659FD7CF "The Election Murder Trial"], ''New York Times,'' May 14, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Matthews was survived by his wife Mary "Tine" Barlow, whom he had married on June 6, 1862. Their son [[John Prentiss Matthews, Jr.]] carried on his father's principles and became a leader in Republican politics. President Benjamin Harrison made him postmaster of a town 130 miles away, [[Carrollton, Mississippi]]. On Christmas Day, 1890, local Democrats shot the 22 year old dead.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Simon Matthews, became an activist in the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] during the 1890s, when a biracial coalition temporarily elected some positions, defeating the Democrats.

{{Socialism sidebar |Models}}

'''Project Cybersyn''' was a [[Chile]]an project from 1971–1973 during the [[presidency of Salvador Allende]] aimed at constructing a distributed [[decision support system]] to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of [[telex]] machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/web/page/normal/11088.html| title=IU professor analyzes Chile's 'Project Cybersyn'| author=| date=| work=| publisher=UI News Room| accessdate=27 May 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910060602/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/web/page/normal/11088.html| archivedate=10 September 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Cybersyn was based on [[viable system model]] theory and a [[neural network]] approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of [[telex]] machines (''Cybernet'') in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (''Cyberstride'') that would monitor production indicators (such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism) in real time, and alert the workers in the first case, and in abnormal situations also the central government, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (''CHECO'', for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (''Opsroom'') would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.

The principal architect of the system was British [[operations research]] scientist [[Stafford Beer]], and the system embodied his notions of [[organisational cybernetics]] in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories.

==Name==

The project's name in English (Cybersyn) is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "cybernetics" and "synergy". Since the name is not [[euphonic]] in Spanish, in that language the project was called ''Synco'', both an [[initialism]] for the Spanish ''Sistema de INformación y COntrol'', "system of information and control", and a pun on the Spanish ''cinco'', the number five, alluding to the five levels of Beer's [[viable system model]].

==History==
[[Stafford Beer]] was a British consultant in [[management cybernetics]]. He also sympathized with the stated ideals of Chilean socialism of maintaining Chile's democratic system and the autonomy of workers instead of imposing a [[USSR|Soviet]]-style system of top-down command and control.

In July 1971, [[Fernando Flores]], a high-level employee of the Chilean Production Development Corporation ([[CORFO]]) contacted Beer for advice on incorporating Beer's theories into the management of the newly nationalized sector of Chile's economy. Beer saw this as a unique opportunity to implement his ideas on a national scale. More than offering advice, he left most of his other consulting business and devoted much time to what became Project Cybersyn. He traveled to Chile often to collaborate with local implementors and used his personal contacts to secure help from British technical experts.

The implementation schedule was very aggressive, and the system had reached an advanced prototype stage at the start of 1973.

The system was most useful in October 1972, when about 40,000 striking truck drivers [[Presidency of Salvador Allende#Crisis|blocked the access streets]] that converged towards [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. According to Gustavo Silva (executive secretary of energy in CORFO), the system's telex machines helped organize the transport of resources into the city with only about 200 trucks driven by [[strike-breakers]], lessening the potential damage caused by the 40,000 striking truck drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eden Medina|title=Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende’s Chile|journal=J. Lat. Amer. Stud.|number=38|pages=571–606|doi=10.1017/S0022216X06001179|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|CIA-backed military coup]] on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.

==System==
There were 500 unused telex machines bought by the previous government.  Each was put into one factory. In the control centre in Santiago, each day data coming from each factory (several numbers, such as raw material input, production output and number of absentees) were put into a computer, which made short-term predictions and necessary adjustments. There were four levels of control (firm, branch, sector, total), with [[algedonic feedback]]. If one level of control did not remedy a problem in a certain interval, the higher level was notified. The results were discussed in the operations room and a top-level plan was made.

The [[software]] for Cybersyn was called ''Cyberstride'', and used [[Sequential bayesian filtering|Bayesian filtering]] and [[Intelligent control#Bayesian controllers|Bayesian control]]. It was written by Chilean engineers in consultation with a team of 12 British programmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://varnelis.net/blog/kazys/project_cybersyn Project Cybersyn | varnelis.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] operations room was designed by a team led by the [[User interface design|interface designer]] [[Gui Bonsiepe]]. It was furnished with seven [[swivel chair]]s (considered the best for creativity) with buttons, which were designed to control several large screens that could project the data, and other panels with status information, although these were of limited functionality as they could only show pre-prepared graphs. This consisted of slides.&lt;ref name="Medina int"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medina|first1=Eden|title=Interview Eden Medina over Project Cybersyn|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSmQCvfT4pU&amp;list=PLVbT2NExCO8Svz-MH25VEFKNf-TbyViSq&amp;index=9|website=VPRO Tegenlicht|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vision had been distribution of control and involvement of workers in business planning. The design looked more like bureaucratic centralisation of control via bottom up reporting and top-down direction. Workers were expected to perform processes and use resources in the ways that had been modelled and planned. Any significant deviation from was to be reported upwards, and corrective directives were to be cascaded downwards.

The project is described in some detail in the second edition of Strafford Beer's books ''Brain of the Firm'' and ''Platform for Change''. The latter book includes proposals for social innovations such as having representatives of diverse 'stakeholder' groups into the control centre.

==Aesthetics==
The Ops room used [[Tulip chair]]s similar to those used in the [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] TV programme ''[[Star Trek]]'', although according to the designers, the style was not influenced by science fiction movies.&lt;ref&gt;Eden Medina (2011). ''Cybernetic Revolutionaries: Technology and Politics in Allende's Chile'', 1st edn. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01649-0}}. ''section 4, p. 121.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] and economist [[Alvin Cottrell]] referenced Project Cybersyn in their 1993 book ''Towards a New Socialism'', citing it as an inspiration for their own proposed model of economic planning under socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cockshott, W.P., and Cottrell, A. ''Towards a New Socialism''. Spokesman, 1993, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chilean science fiction author [[Jorge Baradit]] published a Spanish-language science fiction novel ''Synco'' in 2008. It is an [[alternate history]] [[science fantasy]] novel set in a 1979, of which he said: "It stops the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]], the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={a839867c-96ee-480f-adf1-c20192023048} |title=Synco: El juego del revés |trans-title=Synco: The Game of Reverse |first=Javier |last=Edwards Renard |work=[[El Mercurio]] Revista de Libros |language=Spanish |date=4 January 2009 |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A race clock may be positioned at the finish line of a race or at various key intermediate locations (split points) so that athletes will know their pace.  The display is typically either [[light emitting diode]]s or plastic elements that can be flipped to reveal or hide a surface painted with a bright color.

The '''Saskatchewan Organization for Heritage Languages''' (SOHL) is a provincial [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting the study and teaching of [[heritage language]]s in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official SOHL Website|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], it concentrates on languages other than [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's official languages of English and French]], and operates as an umbrella organization for groups, schools and individuals across the province. The SOHL was established in 1985.

The SOHL is governed by a Board of Directors and employs two permanent full-time staff members. Its membership consists of over 70 heritage language schools and [[multilingual]] organizations. Regular membership is open to any community-based non-profit organization in Saskatchewan involved in developing, teaching, and promoting the learning of heritage languages. Associate membership is open to individuals and institutions supportive of the aims and objectives of SOHL but not eligible for regular membership. Associate members cannot vote or hold office.

==History==
SOHL had its formal beginning on June 1, 1985, and was designated a non-profit PCO in August 1987. In 1994, SOHL hosted a national conference entitled “Speak Up, Speak Out!” It focused on the job and economic opportunities created by languages and on the importance of languages in the international marketplace. In 1996/97, SOHL introduced a new project - the Mini-Language Lessons Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini Language Lessons Program|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/pages/mini-language-lessons-program|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the public and separate school systems. Heritage language teachers introduced students to the culture and language of various countries in the world.

A Future Search Conference was held in 1999. The purpose was to look at past accomplishments and achievements of SOHL, to look at its current state and to begin the process of creating a new vision for the future. In 2004, SOHL celebrated Heritage Languages Recognition Day with a Choral Festival. Due to the positive response, celebrations are now held annually in both Regina and Saskatoon to mark this occasion.

In 2005, SOHL celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Along with a special celebration at our conference, SOHL produced a Centennial History Book looking back at years of Heritage Language Schools in Saskatchewan. In 2008, SOHL celebrated UNESCO’s declaration of 2008 as the International Year of Languages. A special Yearbook was compiled and published, which outlines SOHL’s various activities, as well as those of MLAR, SIA, and the heritage schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOHL History|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/pages/sohl-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1933 Scottish Shilling.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1933 [[UK]] shilling]]
The '''shilling''' is a unit of [[currency]] formerly used in [[Austria]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and other [[British Commonwealth]] countries.
Currently the shilling is used as a currency in four east African countries: [[Kenya]] ([[Kenyan shilling]]), [[Tanzania]] ([[Tanzanian shilling]]), [[Uganda]] ([[Ugandan shilling]]), and [[Somalia]] ([[Somali_shilling|Somali shilling]]). It is also the proposed currency that the east African community plans to introduce ([[east African shilling]]).
The word ''shilling'' comes from old English "Scilling", a monetary term meaning twentieth of a pound, and from the Proto-Germanic root *[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/skiljan%C4%85 skiljaną] meaning 'to separate.' The word "Scilling" is mentioned in the earliest recorded Germanic law codes, those of Æthelberht of Kent. 

Slang terms for the old shilling coins include "bob" and "hog".  While the derivation of "bob" is uncertain, [[John Camden Hotten]] in his 1864 Slang Dictionary says the original version was "bobstick" and wonders if it is connected with [[Sir Robert Walpole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slang Dictionary|date=1864|author=John Camden Hotten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One abbreviation for shilling is '''s''' (for ''solidus'', see [[£sd]]). Often it was represented by a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus symbol]] ("/"), which may have originally stood for a [[long s|long '''s''' or '''ſ''']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishproject.org/may-and-slash|title=May and the Slash - English Project|author=|date=|website=www.englishproject.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032353/http://www.englishproject.org/may-and-slash|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus ''1/9'' would be one shilling and ninepence (and equivalent to 21[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]; the shilling itself was equal to 12[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]). A price with no [[pence]] was sometimes written with a solidus and a dash: ''11/–.''

The solidus symbol is still used for the [[Kenyan shilling]] (one of the successors to [[East African shilling]]), rather than ''sh''.

During the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]], the mint was instructed to coin one [[troy pound]] (weighing 5760 grains or 373&amp;nbsp;g) of standard [[sterling silver|(0.925 fine) silver]] into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655&amp;nbsp;grams from 1816 until 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced.

In the past, the English world{{clarifyme|date=October 2016}} has had various myths about the shilling. One myth was that it was deemed to be the value of a cow in [[Kent]] or a sheep elsewhere.

==British Isles==

===Kingdom of England===
{{main|Shilling (English coin)}}
A shilling was a coin used in England from the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/moneyold.htm|title=Understanding old British money - pounds, shillings and pence|author=|date=|website=woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031546/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/moneyold.htm|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] around 1550). The shilling continued in use after the [[Treaty of Union|Acts of Union of 1707]] created a new United Kingdom from the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and under Article 16 of the Articles of Union, a common currency for the new United Kingdom was created.

===Kingdom of Scotland===
The term ''shilling'' ({{lang-sco|schilling}}) was in use in Scotland from early Middle Ages.

===Great Britain and the UK===
{{Main|Shilling (British coin)}}

The common currency created in 1707 by Article 16 of the [[Treaty of Union|Articles of Union]] continued in use until [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]] in 1971. In the traditional [[£sd|pounds, shillings and pence]] system, there were 20 shillings per pound and 12 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] per shilling, and thus there were 240 pence in a pound.

Three coins denominated in multiple shillings were also in circulation at this time. They were:
* the [[Two shillings (British coin)|florin]], two shillings (2/–), which adopted the value of 10 new pence (10p) at decimalisation;
* the [[Half crown (British coin)|half-crown]], two shillings and sixpence (2/6) or one-eighth of a pound, which was abolished at decimalisation (otherwise it would have had the value of 12½p);
* the [[Crown (British coin)|crown]] (five shillings), the highest denominated non-bullion UK coin in circulation at decimalisation (in practice, crowns were commemorative coins not used in everyday transactions).
 
At decimalisation in 1971, the shilling coin was superseded by the [[British five pence coin|new five-pence piece]], which initially was of identical size and weight and had the same value, and inherited the shilling's slang name of a ''bob''. Shillings remained in circulation until the five pence coin was reduced in size in 1991.

==={{anchor|Ireland}}Irish shillings===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:92-14a.jpg|thumb|200px|Irish shilling 1954]] --&gt;
Between 1701 and the unification of the currencies in 1825, the [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]] shilling was valued at 13 pence and known as the "black hog", as opposed to the 12-pence English shillings which were known as "white hogs".

In the [[Irish Free State]] and [[Republic of Ireland]] the [[Shilling (Irish coin)|shilling coin]] was issued as ''scilling'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]. It was worth 1/20th of an [[Irish pound]], and was interchangeable at the same value to the British coin, which continued to be used in [[Northern Ireland]]. The coin featured a bull on the reverse side. The first minting, from 1928 until 1941, contained 75% silver, more than the equivalent British coin. The original Irish shilling coin (retained after decimalisation)) was withdrawn from circulation on 1 January 1993, when a smaller five pence coin was introduced.

==Other countries in (former) British Empire/ Commonwealth==

===Australian shillings===
{{main|Shilling (Australian)}}
[[File:Two shilling coin from British West Africa.jpg|right|thumb|Owing to the reach of the [[British Empire]], the shilling was once used on every inhabited continent. This two-shilling piece was minted for [[British West Africa]].]]

[[Australia]]n shillings, twenty of which made up one [[Australian pound]], were first issued in 1910, with the Australian [[coat of arms]] on the reverse and King [[Edward VII of England|Edward VII]] on the face. The coat of arms design was retained through the reign of King [[George V of England|George V]] until a new ram's head design was introduced for the coins of King [[George VI of England|George VI]]. This design continued until the last year of issue in 1963. In 1966, Australia's currency was [[decimalisation|decimalised]] and the shilling was replaced by a [[ten&amp;nbsp;cent coin (Australian)]], where 10 shillings made up one [[Australian dollar]].

The slang term for a shilling coin in Australia was "deener". The slang term for a shilling as currency unit was "bob", the same as in the [[United Kingdom]].

After 1966, shillings continued to circulate, as they were replaced by 10-cent coins of the same size and weight.

===New Zealand shilling===
[[New Zealand]] shillings, twenty of which made up one [[New Zealand pound]], were first issued in 1933 and featured the image of a Maori warrior carrying a taiaha "in a warlike attitude" on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/currency/money/0094086.html Reserve Bank of New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123153550/http://rbnz.govt.nz/currency/Money/0094086.html |date=23 January 2009 }}- URL retrieved 17 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, New Zealand's currency was [[decimalisation|decimalised]] and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin of the same size and weight. Ten cent coins minted through the remainder of the 1960s included the legend "ONE SHILLING" on the reverse. Smaller 10-cent coins were introduced in 2006.

=== Maltese shillings ===
Shillings were used in [[Malta]], prior to [[decimalisation]] in 1972, and had a face value of five Maltese [[Cent (currency)|cents]].

=== Ceylonese shillings ===
In [[British Ceylon]], an shilling ({{lang-si|Silima}}, {{lang-ta|Silin}}) was equivalent to eight [[Madras fanam|fanams]]. With the replacement of the [[Ceylonese rixdollar|rixdollar]] by the [[rupee]] in 1852, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to half a rupee. On the decimalisation of the currency in 1869, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to 50 Ceylon cents. The term continued to be used colloquially until the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lakdiva.org/coins/lanka_monetary.html Early Monetary Systems of Lanka (Ceylon)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622013727/http://lakdiva.org/coins/lanka_monetary.html |date=22 June 2011 }}, Currency Museum Circular No 7, Currency Department, [[Central Bank of Ceylon]], Colombo, 15 March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===East African shillings===
[[File:African use of the shilling.png|thumb|Countries in [[Africa]] where the currency is called shilling.]]

The [[East African shilling]] was in use in the [[uK|British]] [[colony|colonies]] and [[protectorate]]s of [[British Somaliland]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zanzibar]] from 1920, when it replaced the [[rupee]], until after those countries became independent, and in [[Tanzania]] after that country was formed by the merger of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Upon independence in 1960, the East African shilling in the [[State of Somaliland]] (former British Somaliland) and the [[Somali somalo]] in the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (former [[Italian Somaliland]]) were replaced by the [[Somali shilling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310154823/http://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index.php3?action=detailedinfo&amp;id=5597#metadata Description of Somalia shilling] - URL retrieved 8 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966.5, the East African Monetary Union broke up, and the member countries replaced their currencies with the [[Kenyan shilling]], the [[Ugandan shilling]] and the [[Tanzanian shilling]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kituochakatiba.co.ug/eac3.htm Dissolution of the East African Monetary Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042801/http://www.kituochakatiba.co.ug/eac3.htm |date=11 March 2007 }} - URL retrieved 8 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Though all these currencies have different values at present, there were plans to reintroduce the [[East African shilling]] as a new common currency by 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eabc-online.com/tf/fs_customs_union.php East African Business Council - Fact Sheet: Customs Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310150929/http://www.eabc-online.com/tf/fs_customs_union.php |date=10 March 2007 }} - URL Retrieved 8 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; although this has not come about.

=== North America ===
In the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] that became the United States in 1776, British money was often in circulation. Each colony issued its [[early American currency|own paper money]], with [[£sd|pounds, shillings, and pence]] used as the standard [[unit of account|units of account]]. Some coins were minted in the colonies, such as the 1652 [[pine-tree shilling]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. After the United States adopted the [[dollar]] as its unit of currency and accepted the [[gold standard]], one British shilling was worth 24 US [[cent (currency)|cents]]. Due to ongoing shortages of US coins in some regions, shillings continued to circulate well into the 19th century. Shillings are described as the standard monetary unit throughout the autobiography of [[Solomon Northup]] (1853)&lt;ref name="Northup"&gt;Solomon Northup. ''Twelve Years a Slave''. Auburn, Derby and Miller; Buffalo, Derby, Orton and Mulligan; [etc., etc.] 1853&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned several times in the [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]] story, ''[[Ragged Dick]]'' (1868).&lt;ref name="RD"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Alger|first1=Horatio, Jr |title=Ragged Dick; or, Street Life in New York with the Boot Blacks |date=5 May 1868| publisher=A K Loring| location=New York| edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Lundin| first1=Leigh| title=Literary Rags| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2014/05/literary-rags.html| website=SleuthSayers.org| publisher=SleuthSayers| location=New York| date=11 May 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811051657/http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2014/05/literary-rags.html| archivedate=11 August 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somali shilling===

====Overview====
The Somali shilling is the official [[currency]] of [[Somalia]]. It is subdivided into 100 ''cents'' (English), ''senti'' (Somali, also سنت) or ''centesimi'' (Italian).

The Somali shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the [[East African shilling]] was introduced to the former [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]]. Following independence in 1960, the [[Somali somalo|somalo]] of [[Italian Somaliland]] and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling. Names used for the denominations were cent, centesimo (plural: centesimi) and سنت (plurals: سنتيمات and سنتيما) together with shilling, scellino (plural: scellini) and شلن.

That same year, the ''Banca Nazionale Somala'' issued notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 scellini/shillings. In 1975, the ''Bankiga Qaranka Soomaaliyeed'' (Somali National Bank) introduced notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 shilin/shillings. These were followed in 1978 by notes of the same denominations issued by the ''Bankiga Dhexe Ee Soomaaliya'' ([[Central Bank of Somalia]]). 50 shilin/shillings notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 500 shilin/shillings in 1989 and 1000 shilin/shillings in 1990. Also in 1990 there was an attempt to reform the currency at 100 to 1, with new banknotes of 20 and 50 new shilin prepared for the redenomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somalbanca.org/currency.html|title=CURRENCY|author=|date=|website=somalbanca.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227210259/http://somalbanca.org/currency.html|archivedate=27 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the breakdown in central authority that accompanied the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]], which began in the early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the [[Somaliland]] territory, subsequently emerged.

Somalia's newly established [[Transitional Federal Government]] revived the defunct Central Bank of Somalia in the late 2000s. In terms of financial management, the monetary authority is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy.&lt;ref name="Monpol"/&gt; Owing to a lack of confidence in the Somali shilling, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. [[Dollarization]] notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected to come to an end as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.&lt;ref name="Monpol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|title=Central Bank of Somalia - Monetary policy|author=|date=|website=somalbanca.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125062011/http://somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|archivedate=25 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somaliland shilling====
The [[Somaliland shilling]] is the official currency of [[Somaliland]], a self-declared republic that is internationally recognised as an [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous region]] of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Sqfirath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/June/Buh/29_Somaliland_recognition_&amp;_the_HBM-SSC_Factor.html|title=Somaliland’s Quest for International Recognition and the HBM-SSC Factor|author=|date=|website=wardheernews.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528122058/http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/June/Buh/29_Somaliland_recognition_%26_the_HBM-SSC_Factor.html|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currency is not recognised as [[legal tender]] by the international community, and it currently has no official [[exchange rate]]. It is regulated by the [[Bank of Somaliland]], the territory's [[central bank]]. Although the authorities in Somaliland have attempted to bar usage of the Somali shilling, Somalia's official currency is still the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.&lt;ref name="Tfstris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/op2/2009/aug/time_for_somaliland_to_rethink_its_strategy.aspx|title=Time for Somaliland to Rethink its Strategy|author=|date=|website=www.hiiraan.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914215741/https://www.hiiraan.com/op2/2009/aug/time_for_somaliland_to_rethink_its_strategy.aspx|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Elsewhere in the former British Empire, forms of the word ''shilling'' remain in informal use.
In [[Vanuatu]] and [[Solomon Islands]], ''selen'' is used in [[Bislama]] and [[Pijin language|Pijin]] to mean "money"; in [[Malaysia]], ''syiling'' (pronounced like ''shilling'') means "coin". In [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]] the ''shillin'' ({{lang-ar|شلن}}) is equal to 1/20th (five ''qirshes'' — {{lang-ar|قرش}}, {{lang-en|[[piastre]]s}}) of the [[Egyptian pound]] or the [[Jordanian dinar]]. In [[Belize]], the term ''shilling'' is commonly used to refer to twenty-five cents.

==Austrian schilling==
The [[Austrian schilling]] was the currency of Austria between March 1, 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goldadvert.com/knowledgebase/en/gold-and-silver-shillings-of-austria/|title=Gold and silver shillings of Austria|date=2018-06-14|work=Knowledge base - GoldAdvert|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1938 and again between 1945 and 2002. It was replaced by the [[euro]] at a fixed parity of €1 = 13.7603 schilling. The schilling was divided into 100 groschen.

==Other countries' shillings==
[[File:Skilling 1802, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|A Swedish [[Skilling (currency)|Skilling]] from 1802.]]

===Other European shillings===
Shillings were issued in the Scandinavian countries ''([[Skilling (Scandinavian monetary unit)|skilling]])'' until the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]] of 1873, and in the city of [[Hamburg]], Germany.

In [[Poland]] ''szeląg'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguee.com/english-polish/translation/shillings.html|title=shillings - Polish translation – Linguee|author=|date=|website=Linguee.com|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Countries===
In the principalities covering present Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, the cognate term ''schelling'' was used as an equivalent 'arithmetic' currency, a 'solidus' representing 12 'denarii' or 1/20 'pound', while actual coins were rarely physical multiples of it, but still expressed in these terms.

===Other===
The ''soll'', later the ''sou'', both also derived from the Roman [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], were the equivalent coins in [[France]], while the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|(nuevo) sol]] (PEN) remains the currency of [[Peru]].

As in France, the [[Peru]]vian sol was originally named after the Roman solidus, but the name of the Peruvian currency is now much more closely linked to the Spanish word for the sun (''sol'').  This helps explain the name of its temporary replacement, the [[Peruvian inti|inti]], named for the [[Andean civilizations|Incan]] sun god.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8773">A '''soubrette''' is a type of [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] voice [[fach]], often cast as a female [[stock character]] in [[opera]] and theatre. The term arrived in English from [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] via French, and means "conceited" or "coy". A soubrette is also defined as a young woman regarded as flirtatious or frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soubrette soubrette – definition of soubrette by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
In theatre, a soubrette is a comedy character who is vain and girlish, mischievous, lighthearted, coquettish and gossipy—often a chambermaid or confidante of the [[ingénue]], she often displays a flirtatious or even sexually aggressive nature. The soubrette appeared in [[commedia dell'arte]] scenarios, often in the role of [[Columbina]], where the actress would provide the details of her behavior and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delpiano.com/carnival/html/servetta.html Italian Comedy | Commedia dell'Arte | Servetta | Soubrette | Colombina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, she moved to the works of [[Molière]], which were influenced by the Commedia; the role of Dorine in ''[[Tartuffe]]'' (1664) fits the description. A famous example, though a hundred years later, is Suzanne in [[Beaumarchais]]' ''[[Le Mariage de Figaro]]'' (1784).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068785/soubrette Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
In [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[opera]], the term ''soubrette'' refers to both a [[soprano]] [[voice type]] and a type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet [[timbre]], a [[tessitura]] in the mid-range, and with no extensive [[coloratura]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/concertopera/voicetype.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+17:50:42 voicetype&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A soubrette's [[vocal range]] extends approximately from middle C ([[scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) to "high D" (D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsv2.htm Music Dictionary Vm–Vz: Voice (s.), Voices (pl.) – coloratura-soubrette or soprano lirico leggiero], [[Dolmetsch]]&lt;/ref&gt; The voice has a lighter [[vocal weight]] than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes but as they grow older and the voice matures more physically they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a [[light lyric soprano]], a [[lyric coloratura soprano]], or a [[coloratura mezzo-soprano]]. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career.{{sfn|Stark|2003}} The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and [[spinto soprano]].{{sfn|Boldrey|1994}}

The soubrette roles are typically found in comic operas or operettas and they usually portray good-looking, youthful girls who are flirtatious, saucy, and street-wise. Typically these roles are sung by younger singers and both [[sopranos]] and [[mezzo-soprano]]s are cast in them.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} Many soubrette roles have a considerable amount of spoken German dialogue, and therefore the soubrette singer must possess both an excellent comprehension of the German language and considerable acting skills. It is rare today to find true soubrettes singing in major opera houses as their voices are typically unable to carry over larger orchestras in larger halls. Often lyric, coloratura, and mezzo-sopranos are cast in soubrette roles, especially in the early part of their singing careers. This does not mean that these singers are soubrette sopranos but it does mean they can play soubrette roles.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} The [[coloratura soprano]] has a higher range, can sing more dexterous vocal passages and has a somewhat brighter sound than the soubrette. The [[lyric soprano]] has a richer voice and higher range than the soubrette soprano. The mezzo-soprano can sing as high as a soubrette but with a darker timbre and heavier weight in the voice. Mezzos also have a much more extensive range in the lower register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipasource.com/soprano#KOLORATURSOPRAN/KOLORATUR_SOUBRETTE_(c_to_f) IPA Source – Soprano&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the beautiful light voice of the soubrette is ideal for [[baroque music]], [[early music]] and [[baroque opera]], as well as many [[art songs]]. However, the soubrette soprano voice is limited even in this repertoire by its lack of coloratura skill and relatively limited range.{{sfn|Boldrey|1992}} Many operettas and musicals include soubrette characters, such as Valencienne in ''[[The Merry Widow]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlog.org/merrywidow2006/widow_auditions.htm The Merry Widow – VLOG Spring 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820025214/http://www.vlog.org/merrywidow2006/widow_auditions.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], the [[Jessie Bond]] mezzo-soprano roles such as Cousin Hebe (''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'') and Lady Angela ([[Patience (opera)|''Patience'']]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/B/BondJessie.htm Jessie Bond&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the character Ellie Mae Chipley, who sings "Life Upon the Wicked Stage" in Kern and Hammerstein's ''[[Show Boat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_s/show_boat.htm ''Showboat'' – Kern/Hammerstein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Mars suit]] design was utilized as a topic for technology education.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Designing_Spacesuits_Mars.html|title=Designing Spacesuits for Mars|website=NASA|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical education is entirely different from general education

== Current State of Technology Education ==
TeachThought, a private entity, described technology education as being in the “status of childhood and bold experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teachthought.com/technology/the-current-state-of-technology-in-the-classroom-infographic/|title=The Current State Of Technology In The Classroom [Infographic] -|date=2013-03-20|work=TeachThought|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;” A survey of teachers across the United States by an independent market research company found out that 86 percent of teacher-respondents agree that technology must be used in the classroom. 96 percent say it promotes engagement of students and 89% agree technology improves student outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fractuslearning.com/edtech-stats/|title=18 EdTech Stats About the Current State of Technology in Education|date=2013-08-26|work=Fractus Learning|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology is present in many education systems.

==Reception==
''The Tribe'' received widespread critical acclaim by critics, audiences and at festivals all over the world. Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 86% of critics gave the film a "Certified Fresh" rating, based on 92 reviews with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 7.5/10, with the consensus "A bleak, haunting drama whose wordless dialogue speaks volumes, The Tribe is a bold, innovative take on silent films for a contemporary audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/plemya/?search=Plemya|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another [[review aggregator]], assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 27 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "generally favorable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tribe|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the piece four out of five stars, writing, "I can't stop thinking about it." while too praising  Slaboshpytskiy's ability to "[draw] on Samuel Beckett or Peter Brook to create a universal language of anxiety." while concluding the sentiment, "What an intriguing film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe review – deaf-school drama is shocking, violent and unique|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/17/the-tribe-review-deaf-mute-miroslav-slaboshpytskiy|accessdate=17 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the piece, stating, "The use of sign language, deafness and silence itself adds several heady new ingredients to the base material, alchemically creating something rich, strange and very original." He also admired the film's "silky smooth steadicam" cinematography of Vasyanovych. As well as comparing the language of gestures and body posture as "akin to watching a ballet like [[Coppélia]] or [[The Nutcracker]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' heralded the film and its director, Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, by stating: "Actions, emotions and desperate impulses speak far louder than words in The Tribe, a formally audacious coup de cinema that marks a stunning writing-directing debut for Ukrainian filmmaker [Slaboshpytskiy]." Chang was most praiseworthy of Vasyanovych's cinematography, Stepanskiy's sound design as "vividly detailed" and described Odudenko's production designs as "harshly lit corridors and graffiti-strewn exteriors". He also admired Novikova's "fire and vulnerability" as Anya.&lt;ref name="Film Review: The Tribe"/&gt;

Jonathan Romney of ''[[Film Comment]]'' granted the piece high acclaim, "[...] it was a thrill to discover something so bold, innovative, and downright wayward." Stating of the film, "[...] a magnificent example of long-take cinema". and calling it "an astonishing film". He continued by praising Slaboshpytskiy's risky endeavour, to which he "follows through with intrepidity and absolute rigor" as well as Vasyanovych’s "precise compositions". Romney further adds, "The Tribe, in short, was the most surprising, most inventive, and in many ways most disturbing film I’ve seen in Cannes this year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film of the Week: The Tribe|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/cannes-2014-the-tribe-myroslav-slaboshpytskiy-semaine-de-la-critique|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[Film Comment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later named the film among the best movies of 2014.&lt;ref name="The best films of 2014"/&gt;

Eric Kohn of ''[[indieWIRE]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating, adding, "While the specifics remain uncertain, it's never particularly difficult to keep up with the movie's pace, since their actions speak plainly enough -- and sometimes add far more expressiveness than any verbal exchanges could provide." Praising Slaboshpytskiy and Vasyanovych's usage of the steadicam approach, "capturing the actors' exchanges in their full-bodied entirety"; and Slaboshpytskiy as "brilliantly [developing] a suspenseful core through the mysteries of their conversations". He admired Grigory Fesenko's "body movements" and "precise details" through gestures.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Fred Topel wrote, in his review for ''[[CraveOnline]]'', "The piece de resistance is a taboo subject that unfolds in an elaborate single take. It was so harrowing I would have applauded if it would not have been completely inappropriate for the subject matter to do so." Topel praised the cast as "made up of non actors but you wouldn’t suspect that" adding, "They are full of life and energy" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fantastic Fest 2014 Review: ‘The Tribe’|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/film/reviews/763193-fantastic-fest-2014-review-tribe|accessdate=22 September 2014|newspaper=[[CraveOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Kiang of ''[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating and wrote, "It might sound glib, but it's the literal truth: "The Tribe" left us speechless." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cannes Review: Bizarre, Unsettling, Brilliant Critics’ Week Winner ‘The Tribe’|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-review-bizarre-unsettling-brilliant-critics-week-winner-the-tribe-20140528|accessdate=29 May 2014|newspaper=[[indieWIRE|The Playlist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electric Sheep|Electric Sheep Magazine]]'''s Greg Klymkiw granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating "A sad, shocking and undeniably harrowing dramatic reflection of Ukraine with the searing truthful lens of a stylistic documentary treatment (at times similar to that of Austrian auteur [[Ulrich Seidl]])". He continues by commending that, "Visuals and actions are what drive the film and ultimately prove to be far more powerful than words ever could be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tribe|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/reviews/2014/09/23/the-tribe/|accessdate=23 September 2014|newspaper=[[Electric Sheep]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Y. Thompson of ''[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]'' spoke most highly of the film, declaring, "Compelling, upsetting, brutal and brilliant, The Tribe is one of the best works of cinema of the year - a familiar template recreated in what, for most, will be an entirely new world." Too adding, "[...] this is a movie that will and should be used in [[film school|cinema schools]] as a master class in how film is a visual medium." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shape Shifters, Deaf Gangsters and More: 7 Upcoming Horror &amp; Crime Films Reviewed From AFI Fest|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2014/11/shape_shifters_deaf_gangsters_and_more_7_upcoming.php?page=2|accessdate=19 November 2014|newspaper=[[List of assets owned by Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tie clips are commonly made of metal and often have decorative patterns or embellishments. Some clips have a small badge indicating membership to a club or some other affiliation, or some other commemorative token, in a similar manner to the way in which ties themselves may be used as signs of membership. The use of tie clips gained prominence during the 1920s, during which period the use of straight ties made of delicate materials such as silk became more fashionable, and they largely came to replace the more traditional [[tie pin]].&lt;ref name=Devlin/&gt;

In the United States, a tie clip is one of the few items of jewelry allowed to be worn by servicemen and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13429">This '''timeline of the [[Salem witch trials]]''' is a quick overview of the events.

==Preceding the initial outbreak==
;1688
The behavior of several children in the home of the Goodwin family in Boston results in the accusation, trial and execution of their Irish washerwoman, [[Ann Glover]] (also known as "Goody Glover"), for witchcraft.

;1689
[[Cotton Mather]] publishes ''"Memorable Providences, Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/ASA_MATH.HTM|title=Cotton Mather, "Memorable Providences, Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions" (1689)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219164418/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/ASA_MATH.HTM|archivedate=2008-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes his account of the Goodwins and Glover.

November: [[Samuel Parris]] is named the new minister of Salem. Parris moves to Salem from Boston, where ''Memorable Providences'' was published.

;1691
October 16:&lt;ref&gt;Dates prior to September 14, 1752, are in the Julian calendar. When reading primary sources, bear in mind that the legal year in England and the British Empire began on 25 March.&lt;/ref&gt; Villagers vow to drive Parris out of Salem and stop contributing to his salary.

==Outbreak of accusations==
;1692:
January 20: Eleven-year-old [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]] and nine-year-old [[Elizabeth Parris]] begin behaving much as the Goodwin children acted three years earlier. Soon Ann Putnam Jr. and other Salem girls begin acting similarly.

Mid-February: A local doctor (historically assumed to be Doctor Griggs), attends to the "afflicted" girls, and first suggests that witchcraft may be the cause.

Around February 25: Mary Sibly (or Sibley), a neighbor of the Parris family, instructs John Indian, the husband of [[Tituba]], to make a "witch cake" of rye meal and the girls' urine to feed to a dog in order to discover who is bewitching the girls, according to English folk "white magic" practices. She later is called out by Rev. Parris for this and her expression of regret is accepted by the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/villgchurchrcrd.html Salem Village Church Record Book, 27. March 1692]&lt;/ref&gt; Pressured by ministers and townspeople to say who caused her odd behavior, Elizabeth Parris identifies Tituba. The girls later accuse [[Sarah Osborne]] and [[Sarah Good]] of witchcraft.

February 29: Based on formal complaints from Joseph Hutchinson, Thomas Putnam, Edward Putnam and Thomas Preston, Magistrates [[John Hathorne]] and [[Jonathan Corwin]] issue warrants to arrest Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne and [[Tituba]] for afflicting Elizabeth Parris, Abigail Williams, [[Ann Putnam Jr.]] and [[Elizabeth Hubbard (Salem witch trials)|Elizabeth Hubbard]].

March 1–March 7: Magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin interrogate Good, Osborne and Tituba over the course of several days. Tituba confesses to afflicting and confirms Good and Osborne are her co-conspirators.

March 11: Ann Putnam Jr. shows symptoms of affliction by witchcraft. [[Mercy Lewis]], [[Mary Walcott]] and [[Mary Warren]] later alleged affliction as well.

March 12: Ann Putnam Jr. accuses [[Martha Corey (Salem witch trials)|Martha Corey]] of witchcraft.

March 19: Abigail Williams accuses [[Rebecca Nurse]] as a witch.

March 21: Magistrates Hathorne and Corwin examine Martha Corey.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, eds., ''The Salem Witchcraft Papers'' (hereafter ''SWP''), Vol. I, DaCapo Press, 1977, pp. 248-255&lt;/ref&gt;

March 23: Salem Marshal Deputy Samuel Brabrook arrests four-year-old [[Dorothy Good]].

March 24: Corwin and Hathorne examine Rebecca Nurse &lt;ref&gt;''SWP'', Vol. II, pp. 584-487&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Good]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Deodat Lawson]], [https://archive.is/20120712131326/http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Bur1Nar.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all ''A Brief and True Narrative of Some Remarkable Passages Relating to Sundry Persons Afflicted by Witchcraft, at Salem Village Which happened from the Nineteenth of March to the Fifth of April 1692'' as appears in George Lincoln Burr, ed., ''Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, 1648-1706,'' p. 159]&lt;/ref&gt;

March 26: John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin and Rev. John Higginson question [[Dorothy Good]], now in jail.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

March 28: [[Elizabeth Proctor (Salem witch trials)|Elizabeth Proctor]] is accused of witchcraft.

April 3: [[Sarah Cloyce]], after defending her sister, Rebecca Nurse, is accused of witchcraft.

April 11: Sarah Cloyce and [[Elizabeth Proctor (Salem witch trials)|Elizabeth Proctor]] are examined before Deputy Governor [[Thomas Danforth]] and members of the Governor's Council. On the same day Elizabeth's husband, [[John Proctor (convicted witch)|John Proctor]], becomes the first man accused of witchcraft and is jailed.&lt;ref&gt;''SWP'' Vol. 1, pp. 658-662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early April: The Proctors' servant and accuser, Mary Warren, admits to lying and accuses the other girls of lying.

April 13: Ann Putnam Jr. accuses [[Giles Corey]] of witchcraft and alleges that a man who died at Corey's house also haunts her.

April 19: Abigail Hobbs, [[Bridget Bishop]], Giles Corey and Mary Warren are examined. Deliverance Hobbs confesses to practicing witchcraft. Mary Warren, under pressure and accused now of witchcraft herself, reverses her statement made in early April and rejoins the accusers.

April 22: [[Mary Eastey]], who defended her sister Rebecca Nurse, is examined by Hathorne and Corwin. Hathorne and Corwin also examine [[Nehemiah Abbot, Jr. (Salem witch trials)|Nehemiah Abbott, Jr.]], [[Sarah Wildes]], William and Deliverance Hobbs, Edward and Sarah Bishop, Mary Black and Mary English.

May 18: Mary Eastey is released from prison. Following protests by her accusers, she is re-arrested. [[Roger Toothaker]] is also arrested on charges of witchcraft.

May 27: Governor William Phips issues a commission for a [[Court of Oyer and Terminer]] and appoints as judges [[John Hathorne]], [[Nathaniel Saltonstall]], [[Bartholomew Gedney]], [[Peter Sergeant]], [[Samuel Sewall]], Wait Still Winthrop and Lieutenant Governor [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]].

May 31: Hathorne, Corwin and Gedney examine [[Martha Carrier]], [[John Alden (sailor)|John Alden]], [[Wilmot Redd (Salem witch trials)|Wilmot Redd]], [[Elizabeth Howe]] and Phillip English. Alden and English later escape from prison and do not return.

[[File:Lewis memin-tippet.jpg|190px|thumb|right|[[Meriwether Lewis]] wearing a tippet presented to him by [[Sacagawea]]'s brother, [[Cameahwait]].]]
A '''tippet''' is a [[scarf]]-like narrow piece of clothing, worn over the shoulders. It may also be likened to a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] in the secular rather than ecclesiastic sense of this word. Tippets evolved in the [[1300–1400 in fashion|fourteenth century]] from long sleeves and typically had one end hanging down to the knees. In later fashion, a tippet is often any scarf-like wrap, usually made of [[fur]], such as the [[1550–1600 in fashion|sixteenth century]] [[zibellino]]&lt;ref name="QE"&gt;Arnold, Janet:  ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', W S Maney and Son Ltd, Leeds 1988. {{ISBN|0-901286-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the fur-lined capelets worn in the [[1700–1750 in fashion|mid-18th century]].

==Ecclesiastical use==
[[File:Choirhabit.jpg|thumb|[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[priest]] wearing a black tippet.]]
===Anglican===
The ceremonial scarf worn by [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priests, deacons, and lay readers is formally called a tippet, although it is often known colloquially as a "preaching scarf". It is worn with [[choir dress]] and hangs straight down at the front. [[Ordination|Ordained]] [[clergy]] (priests and deacons) wear a black tippet, while [[reader (liturgy)|readers]] (known in some dioceses as licensed lay ministers) wear a blue one. Commissioned evangelists of the [[Church Army]] are presented with a cherry red 'collar' type tippet, as a sign of authority to preach, but some replace this with a scarf form of the tippet, but retaining the distinctive red colour. A red tippet is also worn in some Anglican dioceses by commissioned lay workers.

Tippets are often worn for the Daily Offices of [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], as required in [[Canon law|Canon]] B8 of the Church of England (in the Canon, the word "scarf" is used in reference to the tippet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.churchofengland.org/more/policy-and-thinking/canons-church-england/section-b |title = Canon B8: Of the vesture of ordained and authorized ministers during the time of divine service |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Church of England |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 2 July 2018 |quote= 4. At Morning and Evening Prayer on Sundays the minister shall normally wear a surplice or alb with scarf or stole.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stricter [[low church]] clergy may wear the tippet and [[choir dress]] during any church service, whether Communion is celebrated or not. This follows a practice that was enforced from the Reformation until the late 19th century. By contrast, [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglican Catholics]] tend not to wear the tippet, often preferring to wear the choir habit of Roman Catholic clergy instead.

Clergy who are entitled to wear medals, orders, or awards may fix them to the upper left side of the tippet on suitable occasions (such as [[Remembrance Sunday]]). Sometimes the right end of the tippet is embroidered with the coat of arms of the ecclesiastical institution of which the cleric is a member, but some deplore this usage. It is common for English cathedral Canons to have the coat of arms of their cathedral embroidered on one or both sides of the tippet. 

The tippet is a different item from the [[stole (vestment)|stole]], which although often worn like a scarf is a Eucharistic [[vestment]], usually made of richer material, and varying according to the [[Liturgical_color#Anglicanism|liturgical colour]] of the day.

===Other denominations===
In the British Army, all serving chaplains are issued with a tippet to be worn directly over [[battledress]] when ministering in conflict zones. Anglican chaplains wear the standard black tippet, whilst Roman Catholic chaplains are distinguished by a violet coloured tippet.

Some Lutherans also use the tippet. Members of the Lutheran [[Society of the Holy Trinity]] wear a black tippet embroidered with the Society's seal when presiding at the daily office.

The black preaching scarf (or rarely blue, grey, or green) is also worn by some [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Presbyterian]] ministers and other [[non-conformist]] clergy.

==British military nurses==
A different and non-religious sort of tippet, a shoulder-length cape, has been part of the uniform of British military nurses or of nursing uniforms in Commonwealth countries.  These are often decorated with piping and may have badges or insignia indicating the wearer's rank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15049">{{redirect|Vague}}
In [[philosophy]], '''vagueness''' refers to an important problem in [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophical logic]]. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate "is tall" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. 

Vagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. 

* Base step: Man 1 (George Costanza) is short.
* Induction step: If man ''n'' is short, then man ''n + 1'' is short.
* Conclusion: Man 2000 (Kramer) is short. 

Sorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are ''tolerant'' with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the ''No Sharp Boundaries'' thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. 

The Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Melitus]]. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in ''Synthese'' effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness.  

The problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what ''is'' vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? 

Vagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. 

== Importance ==
Vagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances [[precising definition]]s.&lt;ref name="Williamson.1994"&gt;[[Timothy Williamson|Williamson, T]]. 1994. ''Vagueness'', {{page needed|date=April 2017}}. London: Routledge. &lt;br /&gt;The history of the problem of vagueness is traced, from the first [[Sorites Paradox]] to contemporary attempts to deal with higher-order vagueness such as [[many-valued logic]], [[supervaluationism]], and [[fuzzy logic]]. Technicalities are kept to a minimum to favour a clear account, extremely useful to both students and researchers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=Specific claims regarding the usefulness of a source to readers of this article.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.  Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.  Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from [[transsexual]]s' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see [[intersex]]).

Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance [[species]] in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as [[ring species]].  Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.  As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding [[Husky|huskies]] and [[wolf|wolves]]: are they [[dog]]s? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

== Approaches ==
The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the [[paradox of the heap]], a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

=== Fuzzy logic ===
[[File:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|In fuzzy logic, e.g. the predicates ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' apply gradually (vertical axis, 0 and 1 meaning ''certainly not'' and ''certainly'', respectively) to a given temperature (horizontal axis).]]
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician [[Lotfi Zadeh]]. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "[[Bill Clinton]] is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "[[Patrick Stewart]] is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two [[truth-value]]s: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing ''an infinite number of truth-values'' along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) &lt;ref&gt;Machina, K.F. 1976. "Truth, belief and vagueness", in ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' Vol. 5. pp. 47-78&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Edgington]] (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Edgington, D.| title=Vagueness by degrees| year=1997| pages=294–316| publisher=MIT Press| editor=Keefe, R. |editor2=Smith, P.| url=http://www.jo_syp.republika.pl/media/vbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervaluationism ===
{{main|Supervaluationism}}
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by [[Kit Fine]] and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "[[truth value]] gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Fine, ''The Limits of Abstraction'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning "true on all precisifications".  This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true.  Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

=== Subvaluationism ===
{{main|Dialetheism}}
Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Cobreros, (2011) "Paraconsistent Vagueness: A Positive Argument" ''Synthese'' 183(2): 211–227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Hyde and Mark Colyvan (2008) “Paraconsistent Vagueness: Why Not?” ''Australasian Journal of Logic'' 6: 107–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

=== The epistemicist view ===
{{main|Epistemicism}}
A fourth approach, known as the "epistemicist view", has been defended by [[Timothy Williamson]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, T. 1994. ''Vagueness'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Sorensen|R. A. Sorensen]] (1988) &lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R.A. 1988. ''Blindspots''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Sorensen, Roy| title=Vagueness and Contradiction| year=2001| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Rescher]] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, N.]] 2009. ''Unknowability''. Lexington Books. &lt;br&gt; Uses [[vagrant predicate]]s to elucidate the problem.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.

===As a property of objects===

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.  Consider [[Peter Unger]]'s example of a [[cloud]] (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"):  it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.  So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.  This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans's]] short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Evans, G.| title=Can There Be Vague Objects?| journal=Analysis| year=1978| volume=38| pages=208–| doi=10.1093/analys/38.4.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.  Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's law]] or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter. 1990 ''Material Beings''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Terence. 2000. ''Indeterminate Identity - Metaphysics and Semantics'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal principle== &lt;!--- courtesy under WP:LINK, [[Albert Haddock]] links here]] --&gt;
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.  The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.  This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the [[vagueness doctrine]] and in Europe as the [[principle of legal certainty]].
