Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J.

# [[moral support]]
# [[funding |financial support]]
# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{Anthropology}}
'''[[Anthropology of development|Anthropology]] of media''' (also '''anthropology of mass media''', '''media anthropology''') is an area of study within [[social anthropology|social]] or [[cultural anthropology]] that emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of [[mass media]].

==Methodology==
The use of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods, particularly [[ethnography]], distinguishes media anthropology from other disciplinary approaches to mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Faye Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod &amp; Brian Larkin. (2002) ''Media Worlds: Anthropology of New Terrain''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within [[media studies]], media ethnographies have been of increasing interest since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;David Morley. (1980) ''The “Nationwide” Audience: Structure and Decoding''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ien Ang. (1991) ''Desperately Seeking the Audience''&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stephen Putnam Hughes remarks in a recent review, these studies often do not engage in rigorous ethnographic fieldwork, ignoring or misapplying such landmark anthropological techniques as [[participant observation]] or long-term fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Putnam Hughes. (2011). 'Anthropology and the Problem of Audience Reception', in Marcus Banks &amp; Jay Ruby. ''Made to be Seen: Perspectives on the History of Visual Anthropology''&lt;/ref&gt; Given such differences, anthropologists who take an interest in the media see themselves as forming a distinct subfield from ethnographic approaches to [[media studies]] and [[cultural studies]].

==Theory==
The anthropology of media is a fairly inter-disciplinary area, with a wide range of other influences. The theories used in the anthropology of media range from practice approaches, associated with theorists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as discussions of the appropriation and adaptation of new technologies and practices.  Theoretical approaches have also been adopted from [[visual anthropology]] and from [[film theory]], as well as from studies of ritual and performance studies (e.g. dance and theatre), studies of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], audience reception in media studies, [[new media]] and network theories, theories of [[globalisation]], theories of international [[civil society]], and discussions on participatory communications and [[governance]] in [[development studies]].

==Ethnographic contexts==
The types of ethnographic contexts explored in the anthropology of media range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, [[journalists]] in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media such as newspaper cartoons (Khanduri 2014).  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], human rights &lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Erica (2013) Indigenous Media in Mexico: Culture, Community and the State (Duke University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as [[radio]], [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and [[television]](Mankekar 1999, Abu-Lughod 2005) have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Spitulnik. (1993) 'Anthropology and Mass Media', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 22: 293-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lila Abu-Lughod. (1997) 'The Interpretation of Cultures after Television', ''Representations'', 59: 109-133&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | publisher = Antiquity
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

== Locating Archaeological Sites ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]] (1858-1942) founder of the Boasian tradition in American anthropology]]
'''Boasian anthropology''' was a school within American [[anthropology]] founded by [[Franz Boas]] in the late 19th century.

==Overview==
Boasian anthropology was based on the four-field model of anthropology uniting the fields of [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[physical anthropology]], and [[archeology]] under the umbrella of anthropology. It was based on an understanding of human cultures as malleable and perpetuated through social learning, and understood behavioral differences between peoples as largely separate from and unaffected by innate predispositions stemming from human biology—in this way it rejected the view that cultural differences were essentially biologically based. It also rejected ideas of cultural evolution which ranked societies and cultures according to their degree of "evolution", assuming a single evolutionary path along which cultures can be ranked hierarchically, rather Boas considered societies varying complexities to be the outcome of particular historical processes and circumstances—a perspective described as [[historical particularism]]. 

Another important aspect of Boasian anthropology was its perspective of [[cultural relativism]] which assumes that a culture can only be understood by first understanding its own standards and values, rather than assuming that the values and standards of the anthropologist's society, can be used to judge other cultures. In this way Boasian anthropologists did not assume as a given that non-Western societies are necessarily inferior to Western ones, but rather attempt to understand them on their own terms. From this approach also stemmed an investment in understanding and protecting cultural minorities, and in critiquing and relativizing American and Western society through contrasting its values and norms with those of other societies. Boasian anthropology in this way tended to consider  political activism, through scientific education about society, a significant part of the scientific project.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, R. (1990). Boasian anthropology and the critique of American culture. American Quarterly, 42(2), 252-273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, W. (1991). Claude Lévi‐Strauss Meets Alexander Goldenweiser: Boasian Anthropology and the Study of Totemism. American Anthropologist, 93(3), 599-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darnell, R. (1977). Hallowell's "Bear Ceremonialism" and the Emergence of Boasian Anthropology. Ethos, 5(1), 13-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George W. Stocking. "the basic Assumptions of Boasian Anthropology" in

And Along Came Boas: Continuity and Revolution in Americanist Anthropology. John Benjamins Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The program of research and public education activities pursued by Boas, his former students, and their associates—eventually including most of the field of anthropology as practiced in the United States—encompassed a number of discrete areas of inquiry and activity. These include many anthropological specializations and neighboring inter-disciplines, such as those known today as [[museum anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[Native American studies]], and [[ethnohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Candace|title=Museum Anthropology|journal=Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Interdisciplinary, Searchable, and Linkable Resource|date=2015|doi=10.1002/9781118900772}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zumwalt|first1=Rosemary Lévy|title=American Folklore Scholarship: A Dialogue of Dissent|date=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darnell|first1=Regna|title=American Anthropology and the Development of Folklore Scholarship: 1890-1920|journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute|date=1973|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=23–39|doi=10.2307/3813878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epps|first1=Patience L.|last2=Webster|first2=Anthony K.|last3=Woodbury|first3=Anthony C.|title=A Holistic Humanities of Speaking: Franz Boas and the Continuing Centrality of Texts|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=2017|volume=83|issue=1|pages=41–78|doi=10.1086/689547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Andersen|editor1-first=Chris|editor2-last=O'Brien|editor2-first=Jean M.|title=Sources and Methods in Indigenous Studies|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harkin|first1=Michael E.|title=Ethnohistory’s Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up|journal=Social Science History|date=2010|volume=34|issue=2|pages=113–128.|doi=10.1017/S0145553200011184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boasian anthropologists==
Boas had a large group of students who dominated the first generation of professional anthropologists in the United States, and went on to found many of the earliest anthropology departments in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, G. (1997). Jews, multiculturalism, and Boasian anthropology. American Anthropologist, 99(4), 731-745.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent students of Boas who became exponents of Boasian anthropology were:
*[[Ruth Benedict]]
*[[Edward Sapir]]
*[[Margaret Mead]]
*[[Alfred Kroeber]]
*[[Gladys Reichard]]
*[[Roland Burrage Dixon]]
*[[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]]
*[[Robert Lowie]]
*[[John R. Swanton]]
*[[Paul Radin]]

*[[Ruth Underhill]]
*[[Alexander Lesser]]
*[[Leslie Spier]]
*[[Elsie Clews Parsons]]
*[[Ruth Bunzel]]
*[[Zora Neale Hurston]]
*[[Frank Speck]]

==Critiques==
In the mid 20th century, Boasian anthropology came under critique both from those students who wanted to reintroduce evolutionary processes into the study of culture, and from those who disagreed with its relativist stance and its view that biological differences did not reflect innate differences in human ability or potential. In the late 20th century earlier Boasian anthropology was also critiqued for its acceptance of race as a valid biological category,&lt;ref&gt;Visweswaran, K. (1998). Race and the Culture of Anthropology. American Anthropologist, 100(1), 70-83.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to attempts to redefine a neo-Boasian anthropology which studies the particular historical trajectories leading to the construction of social categories of cultures and races.&lt;ref&gt;Bunzl, M. (2004). Boas, Foucault, and the "Native Anthropologist": Notes toward a Neo‐Boasian Anthropology. American Anthropologist, 106(3), 435-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only complete surviving figure of a larger arrangement of figures. This is the earliest three dimensional representation of the bull leap. It is assumed that thin gold pins were used to suspend the figure over a bull.]]

'''Bull-leaping''' ({{lang-grc|ταυροκαθάψια}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|[[wikt:taurokathapsia|taurokathapsia]]}}&lt;ref&gt;The name of a ritual bull-fight held on occasion of a festival in [[Thessaly]] (scholion to [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 2.78), at [[Smyrna]] ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum|CIG]] 3212) and at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] (CIG 4157).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of non-violent [[bull fighting]] based on an ancient ritual involving an acrobat leaping over the back of a charging bull (or cow). The sport survives in modern [[France]], usually with cows rather than bulls, as {{lang|fr|[[course landaise]]}}; and in Spain, with bulls, as {{lang|es|[[Bullfighting#Recortes|recortes]]}}.  [[Ritual]] leaping over bulls is a motif of [[Middle Bronze Age]] figurative art, notably of [[Minoan Crete]], but also found in [[Hittite Empire|Hittite Anatolia]], the [[Levant]], [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;One argument for the association of Minoan Crete with the Bronze Age culture of the Indus Valley by H. Mode (''Indische Frühkulturen und ihre Beziehungen zum Westen'', Basel, 1944); since the 1940s, further bull-leaping motives have been discovered in 2nd millennium BC contexts in Bactria and northern Anatolia.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often interpreted as a depiction of a [[rite]] performed in connection with [[bull worship]].

==Iconography==
Younger (1995) classifies bull-leaping depictions as follows:
* Type I: the [[acrobatics|acrobat]] approaches the bull from the front, grabs the horns, and somersaults backwards
* Type II: the acrobat approaches the bull from the front, dives over the horns without touching them and pushes himself with his hands from the bull's back into a backward somersault
* Type III: the acrobat is depicted in mid-air over the bull's back, facing the same way as the animal

The Type III depictions are often found in Late Minoan IIIB artwork (14th to 13th centuries BC). Frescoes in [[Tell el-Dab'a]] ([[Avaris]], Egypt) dating to the [[18th dynasty]] (16th to 14th centuries BC) show similar designs besides genuinely Egyptian motifs, for which reason they have usually been ascribed to Minoan-taught Egyptian craftsmen (rather than to Minoan ones directly). They could also have been included as palace decorations because the palace was built for an Aegean princess diplomatically married to a Hyksos pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, David, The Lords of Avaris, Random House, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of bull-leaping scenes have been found in [[Syria]], such as a [[cylinder seal]] impression found in level VII at [[Alalakh]] ([[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period, 19th or 18th century BC) showing two acrobats performing handstands on the back of a bull, with an [[ankh]] sign placed between them, another seal belonging to a servant of [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1800 BC), besides other Syrian examples.  Furthermore, a [[Hüseyindede vases#vase B|relief vase]] was discovered in [[Hüseyindede]] in 1997, dating to the [[Hittite Old Kingdom]] (18th to 15th centuries BC).

==Minoan Crete==
[[File:Minoan Bull-leaper.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Minoan Bull-leaper]] sculpture at the [[British Museum]].]]
Bull-leaping is thought to have been a key ritual in the religion of the [[Minoan civilization]] in [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]]. As in the case of other [[Mediterranean]] civilizations, the [[bull]] was the [[Bull (mythology)|subject of veneration and worship]]. Representation of the Bull at the palace of [[Knossos]] is a widespread symbol in the art and decoration of this archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |url= http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes |title=Knossos: Fieldnotes |work=The Modern Antiquarian |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption, widely debated by scholars, is that the iconography represents a ritual sport and/or performance in which human athletes literally vaulted over bulls as part of a ceremonial rite.  This ritual it hypothesized to have consisted of an acrobatic leap over a bull, such that when the leaper grasped the bull's horns, the bull would violently jerk its neck upwards, giving the leaper the momentum necessary to perform somersaults and other acrobatic tricks or stunts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Contemporary bull-leaping==
[[Image:Goya Tauromachia4.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Speed and Daring of Juanito Apiñani in the Ring of Madrid (1815-16). Etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya|Francisco de Goya]].]]
[[Image:Sauteur.JPG|thumb|300px|A "leaper" in 2006]]
Bull-leaping is still practiced in southwestern [[France]], where it is traditionally known as the {{lang|fr|[[course landaise]]}}, although usually aggressive cows are used instead of bulls. They are the female stock of the fighting bulls bred for the [[Spanish-style bullfighting|{{lang|es|corrida|nocat=y}} in Spain]]. However, once per year bulls are used, in the Festival of Art and Courage. The town of [[Mont-de-Marsan]] in [[Gascony]] is renowned for its fine {{lang|fr|sauteurs}} or 'leapers' and {{lang|fr|écarteurs}} ('dodgers') dressed in brocaded waistcoats. They compete in teams, attempting to use their repertoire evasions and acrobatic leaps to avoid the cow's charges.

The cow is typically guided by the use of a long rope attached to its horns, so that it runs directly at the performers and is restrained from trampling or goring them should they miss a trick. Although there is little to no risk to the cow in this form of contest, it is a highly dangerous sport for the human participants; a prominent one from [[Communauté de communes du Montois|Montois]], Jean-Pierre Rachou, was killed in 2001 when he fell on his head after being hit by a cow.

The {{lang|fr|courses landaises}} are held from March to October on the occasion of festivals in many cities and villages, including [[Nogaro]], [[Mont-de-Marsan]], [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], [[Castelnau-d'Auzan]], and many other places. There are also national championships.

A similar but even more dangerous tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, {{lang|es|[[Bullfighting#Recortes|recortes]]}}, is practiced in some parts of Spain. Specialists {{lang|es|[[torero]]s}} (bullfighters), known as {{lang|es|recortadores}}, compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some {{lang|es|recortadores}} use a long pole to literally [[Pole vault|pole-vault]] over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any guiding rope or similar safety device.

The '''Bullerby Syndrome''' ({{lang-de|Bullerbü-Syndrom}}) is a term referring to an [[idealization]] of [[Sweden]], which may occur in [[German-speaking Europe]]. It consists of a  [[stereotype]] image of Sweden with usually positive associations, including wooden houses, clear lakes, green forests, moose, people with blond hair, happy people and midsummer sunshine. The term comes from [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s ''[[The Six Bullerby Children]]'' books, set in rural Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/jun/23/seacrow-island-astrid-lindgren-new-trip/|title=A New Trip to Lindgren Land|first=April|last=Bernard|newspaper=[[New York Review of Books]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Berthold Franke]] at the [[Goethe-Institut]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, wrote articles about the phenomenon, published in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''.&lt;ref name="svd"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/understrecket/tyskarna-har-hittat-sin-bullerbu_671003.svd |title=Tyskarna har hittat sin Bullerbü|first=Berthold|last=Franke|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=9 December 2007|accessdate=12 February 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that it was originally a view of Sweden, but now also the wish for a better Germany. According to him, Sweden symbolizes a healthy society and nature untouched by mankind.&lt;ref name="sydsvenskan"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/resor/tyskarnas-vilda-karlek-till-sverige/|title=Tyskarnas vilda kärlek till Sverige|newspaper=[[Sydsvenskan]]|date=9 August 2010|accessdate=2 February 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=1770700|title=Traum von verlorener Wirklichkeit|publisher=[[SR International – Radio Sweden|Radio Schweden]]|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=11 December 2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, the term was named "Word of the month" by the [[Swedish Language Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ins/se/de/sto/pre/pech/ppa/3129909.html „Bullerbü-Syndrom“ vom Schwedischen Sprachrat zum „Wort des Monats“ gewählt], Goethe-Institut Stockholm Archive 2007–2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[The Root (magazine)|''The Root'']], Shamira Ibrahim connects the emergence of the "carefree black girl" concept to [[Black Girl Magic|"black girl magic"]], another concept first developed and diffused by black women on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/03/why_i_m_over_the_carefree_black_girl_label/|title=Why I’m Over the ‘Carefree Black Girl’ Label|last=Shamira|first=Ibrahim|date=March 11, 2016|work=The Root|access-date=September 3, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.''''' 861 F. Supp. 303 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1994), ''rev'd'' 71 F.3d 77 ([[2d Cir.]] 1995), ''[[Certiorari|cert.]] denied'' 116 S. Ct. 1824 (1996). 

==Overview==
This an early case of authors attempting to exercise their moral rights under the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] (VARA). VARA was passed in 1990 and added several [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.

==Facts==
The Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in [[New York City]] under the name "Jx3". 474431 Associates was the owner of a former [[Macy's]] warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the [[Long Island City]] section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company ["SIG"] managed the property as "The Factory Building" and marketed it as a mall.

On December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG "to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations" in the building. The artists had "full authority in design, color, and style" of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.

On March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear's representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.

==District Court==

The District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. |vol=861 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=303 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1994 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/861/303/2261919/ |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That decision was appealed to the [[Second Circuit]] Court of Appeals.

==Circuit Court==
The Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a [[work for hire|work made for hire]] and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from ''[[Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid]]'', 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a "work made for hire" or if the artist was working as "independent contractor".

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard. (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Creative Participation''' is a term used in social sciences to describe the position of the observer towards the observed. ''Creative Participation'' - originally a [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] term from the 1920s for analysing social relations of cultural groupings, modified and revived by the German ethnologist [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125194659/http://www.ifeas.uni-mainz.de/info/Magisterabgeschlossen.html V. Dahlheimer]- rewrites the traditional [[participant observation]] approach and leaves more room for non-materialistic cognition. Dynamic movements which can not be measured from disconnected or relative viewpoints can be captured by means of feelings. Verification of data through creative participation is possible through practical conception only and can at best be validated by empirical means. ''Creative Participation'' seeks to counteract classical problems in social science like i.e. rigid defense of theory, personal ambition, and weight of tradition which can lead to social and personal fragmentation.

In consumer psychology ''Creative Participation'' is defined as consumers' co-creation of novel and valuable products, services, ideas, consumption experiences with firms during their purchase or consumption process. According to "Need for Uniqueness"- theory, one of consumers' motivations for creative participation may come from their need for unique products. When consumers need to acquire the symbol of distinct self by unique products, they are driven to create.

''Creative Participation'' is also used as an educational training method. It can breakdown barriers between participants (and agencies), and encourage creative problem-solving, and the building of positive relationships.

In the political world ''Creative Participation'' presents the theory and practice of innovative forms of political participation, i.e. citizens cooperate in public action to achieve a common good.

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26658">[[File:Sculpture courtyard in National Gallery 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One example of institutions created by governments as part of a country's cultural policy is the creation and ongoing funding of national galleries and museums. Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==

Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

'''Cultural psychology '''is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Heine, S. J. (2011). ''Cultural Psychology. ''New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fiske, A.; Kitayama, S.; Markus, H.R.; &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1998). [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/Classes/Readings/Heine2010Cult-Psy.pdf The cultural matrix of social psychology]. In D. Gilbert &amp; S. Fiske &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (4th ed., pp. 915–81). San Francisco: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Shweder]], one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shweder, Richard (1991). Thinking Through Cultures. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-88415-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with other branches of psychology ==
Cultural psychology is often confused with [[cross-cultural psychology]]. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. | last2 = Ruby | first2 = M. B. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 2 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether [[Jean Piaget]]'s stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.R. | last2 = Kitayama | first2 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Culture, Self, and the Reality of the Social | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 277–83 | doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1403&amp;4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including [[social psychology]], [[cultural-historical psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.

== Importance ==

=== Need for expanded cultural research ===
According to [[Richard Shweder]], there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Therefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones.&lt;ref name="schweder84"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Shweder, R.A.|editor2=Levine, R.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Culture theory: Essays on mind, self, and emotion|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the [[indigenous psychology]] approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakkarath, P.|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396430-e-5|chapter=The role of indigenous psychologies in the building of basic cultural psychology|editor=J. Valsiner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|pages=71–95|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research.&lt;ref name="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett, J. J.|year=2008|url=http://facweb.northseattle.edu/kkuwada/Psyc%20200:Fall%202012/article16-1.pdf|title=The neglected 95%: Why American psychology needs to become less American|journal=American Psychologist|volume=63|issue=7|pages=602–614|pmid=18855491|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdest" /&gt; Findings from psychology research utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often labeled as universal theories and are inaccurately applied to other cultures.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = Joseph | year = 2010 | title = Most people are not WEIRD | url = http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jvt002/BrainMind/Readings/Henrich_2010.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 5| page = 29 | doi = 10.1038/466029a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values.&lt;ref name="weirdest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Norenzayan | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The weirdest people in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 61–135 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt; The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the "[[fundamental attribution error]]" or  the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, D.|year=2010|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/media/WEIRDinScience.pdf|title=A WEIRD View of Human Nature|journal=Science |volume=328|issue=25|page=1627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisbettmiyamoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = R. | last2 = Miyamoto | first2 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = The influence of culture: holistic versus analytic perception | citeseerx=10.1.1.87.43 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.004 | pmid=16129648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt;

By studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.

== Mutual constitution ==
Mutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513133-8|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, "...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Southwest|url=https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/index.html?clk=GFOOTER-ABOUT-ABOUT|website=Southwest Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company can ensure the "equal opportunity for learning and personal growth", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure ''safety'' on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a "stable work environment". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:
::Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice. Yale educates aspiring leaders worldwide who serve all sectors of society. We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement|website=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive Example of Mutual Constitution in Society.png|thumb|This image is a representation derived from ideas found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinoba Kitayama.]]
Instead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.

Past research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=Hazel Rose |last2=Kitayama |first2=Shinobu |date=2010 |title=Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=5 |pages=420–430 |doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.

== Criticisms ==

=== Stereotyping ===
One of the most significant themes in recent years has been cultural differences between East Asians and North Americans in [[attention]],&lt;ref name="masuda01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masuda | first1 = T. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.A. | year = 2001 | title = Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans | url = http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 922–34 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 | pmid = 11708567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111518/http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[perception]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = S. | last3 = Kawamura | first3 = T. | last4 = Larsen | first4 = J.T. | year = 2003 | title = Perceiving an object and its context in different cultures: A cultural look at new look | url = http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Students_Post/Slides/kitayama.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 201–06 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.02432 | pmid = 12741741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognition]],&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;Cole, M.

The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to "generalize about human development across nations and continents" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;McNulty, Jennifer (2004, July 26). "[http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/07/531.html Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says.]" University of California: Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.&lt;ref name="wainryb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainryb | first1 = C | year = 2004 | title = The Study of Diversity in Human Development: Culture, Urgencies, and Perils | url = https://psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110173541/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-11-10 | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 131–137 | doi = 10.1159/000077986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty methodology ===
Self-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology.&lt;ref name="masuda01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = Culture and basic psychological processes—Toward a system view of culture: Comment on Oyserman et al | url = http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/indivdualismandcollectivism/culture%20lit/to%20print/Kitayama2002commentsonOyserman.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.89 | pmid = 11843550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Peng | first3 = K. | last4 = Greenholtz | first4 = J. | year = 2002 | title = What's wrong with cross-cultural comparisons of subjective Likert scales: The reference-group problem | url = http://culcog.berkeley.edu/Publications/2002JPSP_referencegroup.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 903–18 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = K. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Wong | first3 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Validity problems of cross-cultural value comparison and possible solutions | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92164/ValidityProblemsComparingValues.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 329–41 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.2.4.329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Cultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.

In fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett &amp; Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]] theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners.&lt;ref name="nisbett96" /&gt; In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural psychology|last = Heine|first = Steven|publisher = W.

Quantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Culture Outside the Head: A Meta-Analysis of Individualism—Collectivism in Cultural Products|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/199|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18544712|pages = 199–221|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308318260|first = Beth|last = Morling|first2 = Marika|last2 = Lamoreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao &amp; Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture–gene coevolution of individualism–collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1681/529|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2010-02-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 2842692|pmid = 19864286|pages = 529–537|volume = 277|issue = 1681|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1650|first = Joan Y.|last = Chiao|first2 = Katherine D.|last2 = Blizinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811906009189|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2007-02-01|pages = 1310–1316|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047|first = Ying|last = Zhu|first2 = Li|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jin|last3 = Fan|first4 = Shihui|last4 = Han|pmid=17134915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural models ==

"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life." Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Fryberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fryberg | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Markus | first2 = H.R. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural models of education in American Indian, Asian America, and European American contexts | url = | journal = Social Psychology of Education | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1381–2890 | doi = 10.1007/s11218-007-9017-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4 I's culture cycle ===

The 4 I's cultural model was developed by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and Alana Conner in their book ''Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.'' In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a "culture cycle." The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.&lt;ref name="Markus"&gt;Markus, H. R., &amp; Conner, A. C. (2013). Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are. New York: Penguin (Hudson Street Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals ====
The first "I" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as "independent", "equal", and "individualistic". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation.  When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as "energetic", "friendly", or "hard-working". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as "obligated to society", "interdependent", and "considerate". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as "I try not to upset anyone," or "I am a father, a son, and a brother."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Heine, S. (2011). Cultural Psychology. San Francisco: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interactions ====
Interactions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying "No Smoking".  These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.

==== Institutions ====
The next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During "birthday month celebration," for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Whiting model ===
John and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at [[Harvard University]], developed the "Whiting model" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.&lt;ref name="Worthman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthman | first1 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Evolving Models for Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 546–562 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitings coined the term "cultural learning environment", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Carolyn P. and Bloch, M. (2010). "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&amp;context=psychfacpub The Whitings' Concepts of Culture and How They Have Fared in Contemporary Psychology and Anthropology]." Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology.Paper 501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being "characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior".&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Berry, Ype H. Poortinga, Marshall H. Segall, Pierre R. Dasen, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Cross-Cultural Psychology: Research and Applications: Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model,&lt;ref name="Worthman" /&gt; and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', "All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisner | first1 = T.S. | year = 2010 | title = John and Beatrice Whiting's Contributions to the Cross-Cultural Study of Human Development: Their Values, Goals, Norms, and Practices | url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/499.full.pdf+html | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 499–509 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and motivation ==

=== Self-enhancement vs. self-improvement ===
While self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heine|first=Steven|date=1999|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|url=|journal=2017 American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2007/06/07/high-self-esteem-may-be-culturally-universal-international-study-shows/|title=High self-esteem may be culturally universal, international study shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunji|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Positive Self-Evaluation on Cross-Cultural Differences in Well-Being|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include [[Social comparison theory|downward social comparison]], compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, [[Attribution (psychology)|external attributions]] and [[basking in reflected glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Psychology|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Steven J. |last2=Raineri |first2=Andres |title=Self-Improving Motivations and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=January 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=158–163 |doi=10.1177/0022022108326193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and empathy ==

=== Cultural orientation: collectivistic and individualistic ===
A main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prooijen|first1=J.|title=Individualistic and social motives for justice judgments|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=1299|issue=1|pages=60–67|doi=10.1111/nyas.12143|pmid=25708080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Hui (1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=C.H.|title=Measurement of individualism-collectivism|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1988|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The [[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental Attribution Error]] has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic).&lt;ref name="Ross (1977)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross|authorlink1=L.|editor1-last=Berkowitz|editor1-first=L.|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|edition=4th|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, the [[self-serving bias]] was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashima|first1=Y.|authorlink2=Harry C. Triandis|last2=Triandis|first2=H.C.|title=The self-serving bias in attributions as a coping strategy: A cross-cultural study|journal=Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology|date=1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1177/0022002186017001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/resources/transcripts/DiscoveringPsychology/26CulPsych.pdf|title=Discovering Psychology: Cultural Psychology|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=|website=Learner.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=G.|title=Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empathy across cultures ===
These differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill&lt;ref name="Duan &amp; Hill (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Hill|first2=C.E.|title=The current state of empathy research|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1996|volume=43|issue=3|pages=261–74|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy&lt;ref name="Soto &amp; Levenson (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soto|first1=J.A.|last2=Levenson|first2=R.W.|title=Emotion recognition across culture: The influence of ethnicity on empathic accuracy and physiological linkage|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1037/a0017399|pages=874–884|pmc=2877627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional empathy:  taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang&lt;ref name="Duan, Wei, &amp; Wang (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Wei|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=The role of individualism-collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Counseling|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=57–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.&lt;ref name="Kitayama &amp; Markus (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Markus|first2=H.R.|title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural and ethnocultural empathy ===
Cultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Ridley &amp; Lingle (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ridely, C.R.|author2=Lingle, D.W.|editor1-last=Pedersen|editor1-first=P.B.|editor2-last=Draguns|editor2-first=J.G.|title=Counseling Across Culture|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousands Oaks: CA|chapter=Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been further developed with the concept of [[ethnocultural empathy]].&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.W.|last2=Blier|first2=J.|last3=Davidson|first3=M.|last4=Savoy|first4=H.|last5=Tan|first5=J.|last6=Tan|first6=J.|last7=Yakushka|first7=O.|title=The scale of ethnocultural empathy: Development, validation, and reliability|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2003|volume=2|pages=221–234|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.50.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyche|first1=L.|last2=Zayas|first2=L.H.|title=Cross-cultural empathy and training the contemporary psychotherapist|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=245–258|doi=10.1023/A:1010407728614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck&lt;ref name="Eysenck (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=M.|title=Psychology: A student's handbook|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press LTD}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen&lt;ref name="Raosal, Eklund, &amp; Hansen (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raosal|first1=C.|last2=Eklund|first2=J.|last3=Hansen|first3=E.M.|title=Toward a conceptualization of ethnocultural empathy|journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1037/h0099278}}&lt;/ref&gt; posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:

Paucity of:
* (general) knowledge outside one's own culture
* (general) experience with other cultures outside one's own
* (specific) knowledge regarding other people's cultures
* (specific) experiences regarding other people's cultures

and:
* inability to bridge different cultures by understanding the commonalities and dissimilarities

These five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.

Another barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy.  One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeTurk|first1=S.|title=Intercultural empathy: Myth, competency, or possibility for alliance building?|journal=Communication Building|date=2001|volume=50|issue=4|pages=374–384|doi=10.1080/03634520109379262}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)" /&gt; The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.

Four important facets of cultural empathy are:&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;
* Taking the perspective of someone from a different culture
* Understanding the verbal/behavioral expression that occurs during ethnocultural empathy
* Being cognizant of how different cultures are treated by larger entities such as the job market and the media
* Accepting differences in cultural choices regarding language, clothing preference, food choice, etc.

These four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)" /&gt; Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.&lt;ref name="Sue &amp; Sue (1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue|first1=D.W.|last2=Sue|first2=D.|title=Barriers to effective cross-cultural counseling|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=5|pages=420–429|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.24.5.420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on intercultural competence, see [[intercultural competence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9294">'''Culturology''' or '''science of culture''' is a branch of [[social sciences]] concerned with the scientific understanding, [[description]], [[analysis]], and [[prediction]] of [[culture]]s as a whole. While different cultural practices were studied by [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]], these studies included [[interdisciplinarity|diverse aspects]]: [[sociology|sociological]], [[psychology|psychological]], etc. and the need was recognized in a discipline focused exclusively on cultural aspects.&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt; 
 
== In Russia ==
The notion of culturology ({{lang-ru|Культурология}}),  as an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] branch of the humanities, may be traced in Russia to the late 1960s and associated with  the work of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Aleksei Losev]], [[Sergey Averintsev]], [[Georgy Gachev]], [[Yuri Lotman]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication. New York: St. Martin's Press (Scholarly and Reference Division), 1969, [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/tc_1.html Chapter 1: From Culturology to Transculture]&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of research challenged  [[Marxist]] socio–political  approach to culture. 

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], culturology was reintroduced into the [[Higher Attestation Commission]]'s list of specialties for which scientific degrees may be awarded in the [[Russian Federation]] and is now a compulsory object of study during the first year at institutions of [[higher education]] and in [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.informika.ru/cgi-bin/vak/q2.plx?key1=24 specialties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407033910/http://db.informika.ru/cgi-bin/vak/q2.plx?key1=24 |date=2007-04-07 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined as the study of human [[culture]]s, their integral systems, and their influence on human behavior, it may be formally compared to the Western discipline of [[cultural studies]], although it has a number of important distinctions.

Formation of Cultural Sciences in Russia is connected with the activities of the Soviet-Armenian scientist Edward S. Markarian (1929–2011) and his first research on cultural from 1960 to 1970, opening a new direction in science for the Soviet Union. Outside Russia, between 1980 and 1990, culturology in Russia received official recognition and was legalized as a form of science and a subject of study for institutions of higher learning.
Over the past decade the Russian Federation has created the following basic cultural schools:

*philosophy of culture (A.&amp;nbsp;Arnold, G.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Drach, N.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp; Zlobin, M.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Kagan, V.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Mezhuyev, Y.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Solonin, M.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Turov and others)
*theory of culture (B.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Yerasov, A.&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;.Karmin, V.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Lukov, A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Pelipenko, E.&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;Sokolov, A.&amp;nbsp;Ya.&amp;nbsp;Fliyer and others),
*cultural history (S.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Ikonnikova, I.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Kondakov, E.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Shulepova, I.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Yakovenko and others),
*sociology of culture (I.&amp;nbsp;Akhiezer, L.&amp;nbsp;G. Ionin, L.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Kogan, A.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Shendrik and others),
*cultural anthropology (A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Belik, Ye.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Orlova, A.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Orlov-Kretschmer, Yu.&amp;nbsp;M..&amp;nbsp;Reznik and others),
*applied cultural studies (O. Astaf'eva, I.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Bykhovskaya and others),
*cultural studies Art (K.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Razlogov, N.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Hrenov and others),
*[[semiotics of culture]] ([[Juri Lotman]], [[Vladimir Toporov|V.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|V.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Ivanov]], E.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Meletinsky and others),
*cultural education (G.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Zvereva, A.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Kravchenko, T.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Kuznetsova, L.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Mosolova and others).

From 1992, research was started by the Russian Institute for Cultural Research. Today, along the line of the central office located in Moscow, three branches have been opened RIC – Siberian (opened in 1993 in Omsk), St. Petersburg Department (opened in 1997) and the Southern Branch (opened in 2012 in Krasnodar)

=== Culturology studies at Moscow Lomonosov University ===
In 1990, at the faculty of philosophy, a chair of the history and theory of world culture was created. Many prominent Soviet and Russian scholars like V. V. Ivanov, S. S. Averintsev, A. Y. Gurevich, M. L. Gasparov, G. S. Knabe, E. M. Miletinskiy, V. N. Romanov, T. V. Vasilyeva, N. V. Braginskaya, V. V. Bibikhin, [[Alexander Dobrokhotov]] have worked there.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.philos.msu.ru/kaf/itmk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]] founded a school of Culturology at the Department of Language Studies of [[Moscow Lomonosov University]]. Rozhdestvensky's approach to the development of culture (accumulation and mutual influence of layers) can be compared to the approach used in [[media ecology]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In Anglophone contemporary [[social sciences]] the word ''culturology'' was coined by American anthropologist [[Leslie White]], who defined it as a field dedicated to the study of culture and cultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. (1959). ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome''. McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Leslie, (1975) “The Concept of Cultural Systems: A Key to Understanding Tribes and Nations, Columbia University, New York&lt;/ref&gt; White notices that culturology was earlier known as "science of culture" as defined by English anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in his book 1872 ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1754562 | title=Culturology | author=Leslie A. White | journal=Science |series=New Series | date= 21 November 1958| volume=128 | issue=3334 | pages=1246}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also notices that he introduced this term in 1939 and for the first time the term appeared in English dictionaries in 1954. He also remarks that the corresponding German term ''Kulturwissenschaft'' was introduced by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;

Following White, philosopher of science [[Mario Bunge]] defined culturology as the sociological, economic, political, and historical study of concrete cultural systems. "Synchronic culturology" is said to coincide with the [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[political ideology]] of cultures. By contrast, "diachronic culturology" is a component of [[history]]. According to Bunge, "scientific culturology" also differs from traditional [[cultural studies]] as the latter are often the work of idealist literary critics or pseudo-philosophers ignorant of the [[scientific method]] and incompetent in the study of social facts and concrete social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario, (1998) Social Science Under Debate, Toronto: University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunge’s systemic and materialist approach to the study of culture has given birth to a variety of new fields of research in the [[social sciences]]. [[Fabrice Rivault]], for instance, was the first scholar to formalize and propose international political culturology as a subfield of [[international relations]] in order to understand the global cultural system, as well as its numerous subsystems, and explain how cultural variables interact with [[politics]] and [[economics]] to impact world affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturology.com/definition/  Rivault, Fabrice, (1999) ''Culturologie Politique Internationale : Une approche systémique et matérialiste de la culture et du système social global'', McGill Dissertation, Montréal, Culturology Press]&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific approach differs radically from [[culturalism]], [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], and cultural [[postmodernism]] because it is based on [[logic]], [[empiricism]], [[systemism]], and [[emergent materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario, (2009) ''Political Philosophy - Fact, Fiction and Vision'', Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick&lt;/ref&gt; International political culturology is being studied by scholars around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-21/chapter-1.htm Xintian, Yu (2005) “Cultural Factors In International Relations”, Chinese Philosophical Studies.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410220456/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-21/chapter-1.htm |date=2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xintian, Yu (2009),"Combining Research on Cultural Theory and International Relations"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5976">The '''Cybernetic Culture Research Unit''' ('''Ccru''') was a student-run interdisciplinary collective founded in 1995 out of the [[University of Warwick]]'s philosophy department.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"&gt;[http://divus.cc/london/en/article/nick-land-ein-experiment-im-inhumanismus Mackay, Robin. "Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism." ''Divus''. 27 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with the work of [[Sadie Plant]] and [[Nick Land]].

==History==
The collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers [[Sadie Plant]] (around whom it was founded), [[Nick Land]], and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging [[cyberfeminist]] thinking that would lead to the ''Virtual Futures'' conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Reynolds, Simon. "Renegade Aacdemia"]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing [[post-structuralism]], [[cybernetics]], [[science-fiction]], [[rave culture]], and [[occult studies]].&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled ''Ccru: Writings 1997-2003'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0/|title=Ccru: Writings 1997-2003|accessdate= September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant.&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"&gt;[http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10459/1/nick-land-mind-games Fisher, Mark.

The role played by Land, Plant, and the Ccru in the development of what has come to be known as [[accelerationism]] is profound, and its legacy is apparent in contemporary debates concerning the viability of the theory in its various guises.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, '[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Accelerate/Accelerate-Introduction.pdf Introduction]' to ''#Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader'', (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014) pp.1-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.{{r|mani}}&lt;ref&gt;Nick Srnicek &amp; Alex Williams, ‘[http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/ #Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics],’ Dark Trajectories: Politics of the Outside, ed. Joshua Johnson (Hong Kong, NAME, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Land himself makes this distinction clear in his commentary on the manifesto.{{r|land}}

A recent extension to the [[Death and culture|cultural relationship with death]] is the increasing number of people who die having created a large amount of digital content, such as [[social media]] profiles, that will remain after death. This may result in concern and confusion, because of automated features of dormant accounts (e.g. birthday reminders), uncertainty of the deceased's preferences that profiles be deleted or left as a memorial, and whether information that may violate the deceased's privacy (such as email or browser history) should be made accessible to family.

Issues with how this information is sensitively dealt with are further complicated as it may belong to the service provider (not the deceased) and many do not have clear policies on what happens to the accounts of deceased users. While some sites, including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], have policies related to death, others remain dormant until deleted due to inactivity or transferred to family or friends. It is expected that the accounts of deceased people will outnumber those of active users unless providers include specific policies and accounts' management tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://what-if.xkcd.com/69/|title=When, if ever, will Facebook contain more profiles of dead people than of living ones?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-mail==
[[Gmail]]&lt;ref name="support.google.com"&gt;{{citation|url=https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/deceased?hl=en|title=Submit a request regarding a deceased user's account}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hotmail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=2aa89618-2244-4187-8383-39b5503587f5|title=How to request data from a deceased user's account?}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow the email accounts of the deceased to be accessed, provided certain requirements are met. [[Yahoo! Mail]] will not provide access, citing the No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability clause in the [[Yahoo!]] terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html|title=Yahoo Terms of Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Yahoo! was ordered by the Probate Court of Oakland County, Michigan, to release emails of deceased US Marine Justin Ellsworth to his father, John Ellsworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-releases-e-mail-of-deceased-Marine/2100-1038_3-5680025.html|title=Yahoo releases e-mail of deceased Marine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By website==

===Facebook===
Facebook's policy on death is to turn the deceased user's profile into a [[memorial]], "as a place where people can save and share their memories of those who've passed."&lt;ref name="blog.facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=163091042130|title=Facebook Newsroom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorializing of a profile involves: the deceased user no longer showing up in the "Suggestions" box on the right-hand side of the [[homepage]]; the privacy setting is altered so that only confirmed friends can view the profile and search for it; contact information and status updates are removed; no one is able to log into the account in the future.&lt;ref name="blog.facebook.com"/&gt; Deletion of an account entails the complete removal of the deceased user's data from the online platform, however Facebook holds the legal right to sustain the user's credentials for up to 90 days after request of deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eclosure.com.au/facebook-death/|title=How To Close Facebook After Death - eClosure|date=18 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to memorialize a deceased person's account, a special contact form must be filled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/234739086860192|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|website=Facebook|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this contact form, a proof of death must be provided, such as an [[obituary]] or [[news article]]. Both family members and non-family members are allowed to submit this form.

===Dropbox===
The general terms of service&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dropbox.com/terms|title=Dropbox Terms of Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Dropbox state that inactive accounts will be deleted after 90 days since the last login. Access to the account of a deceased individual may be requested by providing verification that the person is deceased and the applicant has a legal right to access their files (such as a court order).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/access-account-of-someone-who-passed-away|title=Access the Dropbox account of someone who has passed away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google===
In April 2013, Google announced the creation of the 'Inactive Account Manager', which allows users of Google services to set up a process in which ownership and control of inactive accounts is transferred to a delegated user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/plan-your-digital-afterlife-with.html|title= Plan your digital afterlife with Inactive Account Manager|work=Google Blog|date=11 April 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9997105/Google-RIP-What-Inactive-Account-Manager-means-for-your-will.html|title=Google RIP: What Inactive Account Manager means for your will|work=The Telegraph|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google also allows users to submit a range of requests regarding accounts belonging to deceased users.&lt;ref name="support.google.com"/&gt; Google can work with immediate family members and representatives to close online accounts in some cases once a user is known to be deceased, and in certain circumstances may provide content from a deceased user's account.

===MySpace===
MySpace will allow a memorial to be set up to honor deceased users.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Twitter===
Upon request, [[Twitter]] can close accounts and provide archives of public tweets for deceased users. Family members are required to submit a formal request to Twitter's Trust and Safety department. They must have a copy of the death certificate or Twitter will not take action despite obituary articles and news clips.
This has changed and now{{When|date=January 2018}} Twitter only allows account deactivation for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.twitter.com/groups/33-report-a-violation/topics/148-policy-information/articles/87894-how-to-contact-twitter-about-a-deceased-user|title=Contacting Twitter about a deceased user or media concerning a deceased family member|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikipedia===
Users who have made at least several hundred edits or are otherwise known for substantial contributions to [[Wikipedia]] can be noted at a [[Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines|central memorial page]]. Wikipedia user pages are ordinarily fully edit-protected after the user has died, to prevent vandalism.

===YouTube===
[[YouTube]] grants access to accounts of deceased persons under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3306113?hl=en |title=Fix account problems: Obtaining a deceased person's YouTube videos|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the data options that one can select to give access to a trusted contact with Google's Inactive Account Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/plan-your-digital-afterlife-with.html|title=Plan your digital afterlife with Inactive Account Manager|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital inheritance==
{{Main|Digital inheritance}}
''Digital inheritance'' is the process of handing over (personal) [[Digital media|digital assets]] to (human) [[Beneficiary|beneficiaries]]. These digital assets include [[digital estate]]s and the right to use them. It may include bank accounts, writings, photographs, and social interactions.

There are several services that offer to keep multiple passwords, sending them to people of personal choice after death. Some of these send the customer an email from time to time, prompting to confirm that that person is still alive, and failure to respond to multiple emails makes the service provider to assume that the person has deceased, and will thereafter give out the passwords as previously requested.&lt;ref name=Duffy2012/&gt; The ''Data Inheritance'' function from SecureSafe gives an "activator code" that the customer will hand to another trustworthy person of personal choice, and in the event of death that person then enters the code into Secure Safe's system to get access to the deceased person's digital inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whathype.com/when-you-die-will-your-digital-data-die-with-you/ |title=When You Die Will Your Digital Data Die With You? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=whathype.com |publisher= |access-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy Locker and [https://www.safebeyond.com/ SafeBeyond] require two verifiers who both must confirm the death, as well as providing a death certificate, before any passwords will be handed out.&lt;ref name=Duffy2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410635,00.asp |title=Get Organized: Passing on Your Passwords |last1=Duffy |first1=Jill |last2= |first2= |date=2012-10-08 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=PCMag Digital Group |access-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who are paranoid about their online Privacy, platforms like LifeBank offer a helpful secure capability to store all internet account passwords offline whilst ensuring that a trusted person is given permission to access the individual's LifeBank when they die.  This gives the inheritor the ability to access and edit accounts, including deleting information or indeed the entire account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Rogers
 | first = Everett M.
 | authorlink = Everett Rogers
 | year = 1962
 | title = Diffusion of Innovations
 | publisher = Free Press of Glencoe, Macmillan Company
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Eight Principles of ''Yong''''' ({{zh|c=永字八法|p=Yǒngzì Bā Fǎ}}; {{lang-ja|永字八法/えいじはっぽう}}, ''eiji happō''; {{lang-ko|영자팔법/永字八法}}, ''Yeongjapalbeop'') explain how to write eight common [[Stroke (Chinese character)|stroke]]s in [[regular script]] which are found all in the one character, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|永}}}} ({{zh|p=yǒng}}, "forever", "permanence"). It was traditionally believed that the frequent practice of these principles as a beginning [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]] could ensure [[beauty]] in one's writing.

The Eight Principles are influenced by the earlier Seven Powers ({{lang|zh|七勢}})  by Lady [[Wei Shuo]] ({{lang|zh|衛鑠}}) of [[Eastern Jin]]. Publications on the Principles include:
* ''The Praise to the Eight Principles of "Yong"'' ({{lang|zh|永字八法頌}}) by [[Liu Zongyuan]] ({{lang|zh|柳宗元}}) of the [[Tang Dynasty]].
* ''Explanations to the Eight Principles of "Yong"'' ({{lang|zh|永字八法解}}) by Li Puguang ({{lang|zh|李溥光}}) of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Lǐ provided two-character [[metaphor]]ical names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">In [[sociology]], '''feminization''' is the shift in [[gender role]]s and [[sex role]]s in a society, group, or organization towards a focus upon the [[feminine]]. It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux {{ISBN|0-374-52558-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of the labor force ==
Feminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anisha-motwani/the-feminization-of-workp_b_8258716.html|title=Why The Feminisation Of The Workplace Is Good News For Everyone|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1320929|title=Feminization of the labor force : paradoxes and promises in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization and the living wage movement ==
Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|title=For Want of a Nail|quote=
&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.

&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

"'''For Want of a Nail'''" is a [[proverb]], having numerous variations over several centuries, reminding that seemingly unimportant acts or omissions can have grave and unforeseen consequences.

== Analysis ==
{{quote box|border=1px|align=right|title=''"Knight" Variation''|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
for want of a shoe the horse was lost,
for want of a horse the knight was lost,
for want of a knight the battle was lost,
for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
So a kingdom was lost&amp;mdash;all for want of a nail.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' ''DC Comics, 1998''}}

The proverb has come down in many variations over the centuries. It describes a situation in which a failure to anticipate or correct some initially small dysfunction leads by successively more critical stages to an egregious outcome. The rhyme's implied small difference in initial conditions is the lack of a spare [[horseshoe]] [[Nail (fastener)|nail]], relative to a condition of its availability.&lt;ref name=everything.com/&gt; At a more literal level, it expresses the importance of [[military logistics]] in warfare.

Such chains of [[causality]] are perceived only in [[hindsight]]. No one ever lamented, upon seeing his unshod horse, that the kingdom would eventually fall because of it.&lt;ref name=everything.com&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097943 For want of a nail @ Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related sayings are is "A stitch, in time, saves nine" and "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". A somewhat similar idea is referred to in the [[metaphor]] known as [[camel's nose|the camel's nose]].

*In British Columbia Saw-Mill Co. v. Nettleship (1868), L.R. 3 C.P. 499 (Eng. Q.B.), a variation on the story is given a legal flavour:
**"Cases of this kind have always been found to be very difficult to deal with, beginning with a case said to have been decided about two centuries and a half ago, where a man going to be married to an heiress, his horse having cast a shoe on the journey, employed a blacksmith to replace it, who did the work so unskilfully that the horse was lamed, and, the rider not arriving in time, the lady married another; and the blacksmith was held liable for the loss of the marriage. The question is a very serious one; and we should inevitably fall into a similar absurdity unless we applied the rules of common sense to restrict the extent of liability for the breach of contract of this sort."

Along with  the long history of the proverb listed above, it has continued to be referenced since the mid 20th century in modern culture.  Examples include:

=== Legal ===

*In his dissent in ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (549 US 497, 2007), Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cites "all for the want of a horseshoe nail" as an example of a ''possible'' chain of causation.  He claimed that, by contrast, the threshold jurisdictional issue of standing requires a ''likely'' chain of causation, which was not satisfied by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s regulation of new automobile emissions to prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;''Massachusetts v. E.P.A.'', 549 U.S. 497, 546 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his dissent in ''[[CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride]]'', Roberts again invokes the proverb, explaining that, in [[tort|tort law]], the doctrine of [[proximate cause]] is meant to "limit[] liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-235.pdf ''CSX Transportation, Inc. v.

*The children's poem "The Nail and the Horse shoe (Гвоздь и Подкова)" by Russian writer [[Samuil Marshak]] describes a situation where the enemy captured a city because a blacksmith shop did not have a nail in stock.  The flow of the poem is very similar to that of its English equivalent.
*[[William Golding]] quotes the whole poem at the end of chapter 9 of his novel ''[[The Spire]]''. There, the nail referred to is one of the [[Nail (relic)|Nails of the Holy Cross]]. That relic, when embedded at the base of the cross which had to be erected on top of the spire under construction next to [[Salisbury Cathedral]], was thought to ensure stability to the whole, daring building, and to defeat the evil forces raging against it (symbolized by the howling wind).

'The Want of a Nail"&lt;/poem&gt;|source= – T. Rundgren&lt;br&gt;''Warner Chappell N.A., Ltd., 1989''}}
* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s song [["The Want of a Nail"]] from his album ''[[Nearly Human]]'' uses the rhyme as a metaphor for a man who has lived his entire life without love, and how, if you "multiply it a billion times" and "spread it all over the world," things fall apart. A cover of Rundgren's version is also used in the 2003 film ''[[Camp (2003 film)|Camp]]'' as the cast is introduced at the end of the film.
* [[Aesop Rock]]'s song "No City" from his album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' samples a voice reading the proverb, setting the tone for the idiosyncratic rap.

* [[Newsboys]] song "It's All Who You Know" from the album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' is based on variations of the theme

=== Cinema and television ===

* The title of the season two episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', "[[For Want of a Boot]]", is adapted from the proverb. The episode's concept itself is also based on the proverb, with the character of [[Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]] going through a convoluted process involving several camp personnel, in order to get a new boot.
* In the movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', the proverb was used by Kamata (Sonny Chiba) to explain to his nephew the result of a small detail being overlooked.
* In the movie ''[[Father Goose (film)|Father Goose]]'', Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) in his first scene of the movie, while talking to an Admiral on the telephone, uses part of the proverb by saying "For want of a nail, the war was..." in reference to finding an additional coastal plane spotter.
* In the episode of USA's ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "[[List of Monk episodes#Season 5: 2006–2007|Mr. Monk at Your Service]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0946426/ Mr. Monk at Your Service] (Retrieved 20090401)&lt;/ref&gt; Monk quotes the proverb after being challenged by an employee that suggest a fork being a centimeter off center wasn't a problem. Monk: "For the want of a nail, the kingdom was lost."
* In the 1982 movie ''[[The Verdict]]'', Ed Concannon (James Mason) uses the proverb, "for want of a shoe the horse was lost" to his disciples to describe what the case has become after Frank Galvin turned down the settlement.
* The entire proverbial rhyme is recited by the character Abraham Farlan in the 1946 motion picture ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. Here it was used to describe the chain of circumstances which formed the life of the main character, Peter Carter.
* In season two, episode three of the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', while trying to repair the timer device in a world crippled by 'anti-technology' Professor Arturo exclaims, "For want of a shoe the war was lost."
* In the 50th episode of ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Dead or Alive]]'', Man On Horseback, Josh Randall, [[Steve McQueen]]'s character, uses the proverb "''For the want of a nail, they lost the shoe. For the want of a shoe, they lost the horse. For the want of a horse, they lost the rider''" to justify the reason why he is taking with him four extra horseshoes.
* In the 1967 [[Mannix]] episode 'Turn Every Stone,' Joe Mannix alludes to the saying at  the end when he says, "It's the old horseshoe-nail bit again. For want of $10,000, a million was lost."
* In the 1954 movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'', Captain Queeg ([[Bogart]]) refers to the proverb during the following conversation with Ensign Keith after he reprimanded him for failing to enforce the untucked shirt-tails rule. "I know a man's shirt's a petty detail, but big things are made up of details. Don't forget, 'For want of a nail, a horseshoe was lost and then the whole battle.' A captain's job is a lonely one. He's easily misunderstood. Forget that I bawled you out."

{{Generations Sidebar}}

'''Generation X''' or '''Gen X''' is the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[baby boomers]] and preceding the [[Millennials]].  There are no precise dates for when Generation X starts or ends.  Demographers and researchers typically use birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.

Members of Generation X were children during a time of shifting societal values and as children were sometimes called the "[[latchkey kid|latchkey]] generation", due to reduced adult supervision as children compared to previous generations, a result of increasing [[divorce]] rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults, they were dubbed the "[[MTV Generation]]" (a reference to the [[MTV|music video channel of the same name]]). In the 1990s they were sometimes characterized as [[slackers]], [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and disaffected.  Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of [[grunge]] and [[hip hop music]], and [[indie film]]s. In midlife, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a [[work–life balance]]. The cohort has been credited with [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] tendencies.

==Origin of term==
[[File:Douglas Coupland Photo of Author.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|200px|[[Douglas Coupland]] popularized the term "Generation X" in his 1991 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]''.]]
The term "Generation X" has been used at various times throughout history to describe alienated youth. In the 1950s, Hungarian photographer [[Robert Capa]] used Generation X as the title for a photo-essay about young men and women growing up immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v10ZUR_Ca3EC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=generation+x+holiday&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=generation%20x%20holiday GenXegesis: essays on alternative youth (sub)culture By John McAllister Ulrich, Andrea L. Harris] p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, English musician [[Billy Idol]] used the moniker as the name for [[Generation X (band)|a punk rock band]],&lt;ref name="Adweek"/&gt; based on the title of a [[Generation X (1965 book)|1965 book on popular youth culture]] by two British journalists, Jane Deverson and Charles Hamblett.&lt;ref name="Gen X"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26339959|title=The original Generation X|date=2014-03-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term acquired its modern definition after the release of ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'', a 1991 novel written by Canadian author [[Douglas Coupland]]. Demographer [[Neil Howe]] noted the delay in naming this demographic cohort saying, "Over 30 years after their birthday, they didn't have a name. I think that's germane." Previously, the cohort had been referred to as Post-Boomers, Baby Busters, New [[Lost Generation]], [[latchkey kid]]s, [[MTV Generation]], and the 13th Generation (the 13th generation since [[American independence]]).&lt;ref name="Adweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetLife2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Demographic Profile - America's Gen X|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/Profiles/mmi-gen-x-demographic-profile.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2016|publisher=MetLife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coupland, Doug. "[http://joeclark.org/dossiers/GenerationX.pdf Generation X]." ''Vista'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lipton|first1=Lauren|title=The Shaping of a Shapeless Generation : Does MTV Unify a Group Known Otherwise For its Sheer Diversity?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-10/news/tv-1845_1_mtv-generation|accessdate=10 September 2016|publisher=Los Angelos Times|date=10 November 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C2WmSCOBR2IC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=baby+bust+generation#v=onepage&amp;q=baby%2520bust%2520generation |title=Encyclopedia of Identity |last=Jackson |first=Ronald L. |last2=Hogg |first2=Michael A. |year=2010 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9781412951531 |page=307 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographer [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss]] observed that Coupland applied the term to older members of the cohort born between 1961 and 1964, who were sometimes told by demographers that they were [[baby boomers]], but who did not feel like boomers. Strauss also noted that around the time Coupland's 1991 novel was published the symbol "X" was prominent in popular culture, as the film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' was released in 1992, and that the name "Generation X" ended up sticking. The "X" refers to an unknown variable or to a desire not to be defined.&lt;ref name="MetLife2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neil Howe &amp; William Strauss discuss the Silent Generation on Chuck Underwood's Generations|date=2001|pages=49:00|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_owfM7CiCA#t=202.342609854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ralphelson|first1=Samantha|title=From GIs To Gen Z (Or Is It iGen?): How Generations Get Nicknames|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/06/349316543/don-t-label-me-origins-of-generational-names-and-why-we-use-them|accessdate=21 May 2016|publisher=NPR|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth dates ==

Generation X is the demographic cohort following the [[post–World War II baby boom]], representing a generational change from the [[baby boomers]], but there is debate over what this means because the end-date of the baby-boomer generation is disputed. Research from [[MetLife]], examining the boomers, split their cohort into "older boomers", which they defined as born between 1946 and 1955, and "younger boomers", which they defined as born between 1956 and 1964. They found much of the cultural identity of the baby-boomer generation is associated with the "older boomers", while half of the "younger boomers" were averse to being associated with the baby-boomer cohort and a third of those born between 1956 and 1964 actively identified as members of Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boomer Bookend: Insight Into the Oldest and Youngest Boomers|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/mmi-boomer-bookends.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographers [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] rejected the frequently used 1964 end-date of the baby-boomer cohort (which results in a 1965 start-year for Generation X), saying that a majority of those born between 1961 and 1964 do not self-identify as boomers, and that they are culturally distinct from boomers in terms of shared historical experiences. Howe says that while many demographers use 1965 as a start date for Generation X, this is a statement about fertility in the population (birth-rates which began declining in 1957, declined more sharply following 1964) and fails to take into consideration the shared history and cultural identity of the individuals. Strauss and Howe define Generation X as those born between 1961 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Booknotes – Generations: The History of Americas Future|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/17548-1/William+Strauss.aspx|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=CSPAN|date=14 April 1991|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703075922/http://booknotes.org/Watch/17548-1/William%2BStrauss.aspx|archivedate=3 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069|date=1992|isbn=978-0688119126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?|date=1993|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0679743651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=The Fourth Turning|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers and demographers continue to use dates which correspond to the strict fertility-patterns in the population, which results in a Generation X starting-date of 1965, such as [[Pew Research Center]] which uses a range of 1965–1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Pew Research|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetLife which uses 1965–1976,&lt;ref name="MetLife2"/&gt; Australia's McCrindle Research Center which uses 1965–1979,&lt;ref name="McCrindle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCrindle|first1=Mark|title=Generations Defined|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=McCrindle Research Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] which also uses 1965–1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timmerman|first1=John|title=How Hotels Can Engage Gen X and Millennial Guests|url=http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/173537/hotels-engage-gen-millennial-guests.aspx|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Gallup|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others use dates similar to Strauss and Howe's such as the [[National Science Foundation]]'s  ''Generation X Report'', a quarterly research report from ''The Longitudinal Study of American Youth'', which defines Generation X as those born between 1961 and 1981.&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-29|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Generation X'', a six-part 2016 documentary series produced by [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] also uses a 1961–1981 birth year range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Geographic Channel's Six-Part Limited Series "Generation X," Narrated by Christian Slater, Premieres Sunday, Feb. 14, at 10/9c|url=http://www.multichannel.com/prfeed/national-geographic-channel-s-six-part-limited-series-generation-x-narrated-christian-slater-premieres-sunday-feb-14-109c/396948|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Multichannel News|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation X|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/generation-x/|publisher=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], a multinational professional services network headquartered in London, describes Generation X employees as those born from the early 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X Employees Struggle the Most Financially, Most Likely to Dip into Retirement Savings, According to PwC Study|url=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2013/2013-financial-wellness-survey-press-release.html|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=PrincewaterhouseCoopers|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===United States===

A 2010 Census report counted approximately 84 million people living in the U.S. who are defined by birth years ranging from the early 1960s to the early 80s.&lt;ref name="U.S. Census"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Age and Sex Composition: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census|accessdate=2013-09-12|page=4|date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 article for the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies]] of [[Harvard University]], George Masnick wrote that the "Census counted 82.1&amp;nbsp;million" Gen Xers in the U.S. The Harvard Center uses 1965 to 1984 to define Gen X so that Boomers, Xers, and [[Millennials]] "cover equal 20-year age spans".&lt;ref name="Masnick"/&gt; Masnick concluded that immigration filled in any birth year deficits during low fertility years of the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Masnick"/&gt;

Jon Miller at the Longitudinal Study of American Youth at the [[University of Michigan]] wrote that "Generation X refers to adults born between 1961 and 1981" and it "includes 84 million people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy: These Young Americans are not Bowling Alone|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University Of Michigan|accessdate=29 May 2013|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1991 book "Generations" authors and demographers Neil Howe and William Strauss, used 1961 to 1981 for Gen X birth years. At the time it was published they wrote that there are approximately 88.5 million U.S. Gen Xers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Strauss|first=Neil Howe|title=Generations|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=0-688-11912-3|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[birth control pill]], introduced in the early 1960s, was one contributing factor of declining birth rates seen in the late 1960s and 70s. However, increased immigration partially offset declining birth rates and contributed to making Generation X an ethnically and culturally diverse demographic cohort.&lt;ref name ="Adweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klara|first1=Robert|title=5 Reasons Marketers Have Largely Overlooked Generation X|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/5-reasons-marketers-have-largely-overlooked-generation-x-170539|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Adweek|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohort confusion"/&gt;

===As children and adolescents===
[[Strauss–Howe generational theory|Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe]], who authored several books on generations, including the 1993 book specifically on Generation X ''13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?'', reported that Gen Xers were children at a time when society was less focused on children and more focused on adults.&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"/&gt;  Gen Xers were children during a time of increasing [[divorce]] rates, with divorce rates doubling in the mid-1960s, before peaking in 1980.&lt;ref name ="Adweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dulaney|first1=Josh|title=A Generation Stuck in the Middle Turns 50|url=http://projects.presstelegram.com/gen-x-turns-50/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=PT Projects|date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Alene|title=Gen X women, young for their age|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/25/image/la-ig-beauty-genx-20110925|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=LA Times|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss and Howe described a cultural shift where the long-held societal value of staying together for the sake of the children was replaced with a societal value of parental and individual [[self-actualization]]. Strauss wrote that society "moved from what Leslie Fiedler called a 1950s-era 'cult of the child' to what Landon Jones called a 1970s-era 'cult of the adult'."&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=What Future Awaits Today's Youth in the New Millennium?|url=https://www.angelo.edu/events/university_symposium/97_Strauss.php|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Angelo State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808195038/https://www.angelo.edu/events/university_symposium/97_Strauss.php|archivedate=8 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Generation Map'', a report from Australia's McCrindle Research Center writes of Gen X children: "their [[Baby boomers|Boomer]] parents were the most divorced generation in Australian history".&lt;ref name = GenMap&gt;{{cite news|title=The Generation Map|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-03_The-Generation-Map_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=McCrindle Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gen X childhood coincided with the [[sexual revolution]], which Susan Gregory Thomas described in her book ''In Spite of Everything'' as confusing and frightening for children in cases where a parent would bring new sexual partners into their home. Thomas also discussed how divorce was different during the Gen X childhood, with the child having a limited or severed relationship with one parent following divorce, often the father, due to differing societal and legal expectations. In the 1970s, only 9 U.S states allowed for [[joint custody]] of children, which has since been adopted by all 50 states following a push for joint custody during the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=All Apologies: Thank You for the ‘Sorry’|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gregory-thomas/all-apologies-thank-you-f_b_931718.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=In Spite of Everything|year= 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1400068821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time period of the Gen X childhood saw an increase in [[latchkey child]]ren, leading to the terminology of the "latchkey generation" for Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blakemore|first1=Erin|title=The Latchkey Generation: How Bad Was It?|url=http://daily.jstor.org/latchkey-generation-bad/|accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=JSTOR Daily|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clack|first1=Erin|title=Study probes generation gap.(Hot copy: an industry update)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-116445054.html|website=HighBeam Research|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/02/141930849/whats-the-defining-moment-of-your-generation|title=What's The Defining Moment Of Your Generation?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These latchkey children lacked adult supervision in the hours between the end of the school day and when a parent returned home from work in the evening, and for longer periods of time during the summer. Latchkey children became common among all socioeconomic demographics, but were particularly common among middle and upper class children. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be latchkey children, due to increased maternal participation in the workforce at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=All Apologies: Thank You for the ‘Sorry’|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gregory-thomas/all-apologies-thank-you-f_b_931718.html|accessdate=2 April 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Teacher's Guide to Generation X|url=http://www.edutopia.org/generation-x-parents-relationships-guide|website=Edutopia|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=The Divorce Generation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576430341393583056|accessdate=2 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toch|first1=Thomas|title=The Making of 'To Save Our Schools, To Save Our Children': A Conversation With Marshall Frady|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1984/09/19/05550017.h04.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|publisher=Education Week|date=19 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corry|first1=John|title=A Look at Schools in U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/04/arts/a-look-at-schools-in-us.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=4 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCrindle Research Center described the cohort as "the first to grow up without a large adult presence, with both parents working", stating this led to Gen Xers being more peer-oriented than previous generations.&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[Economic and Social Research Council]] described Generation X as "Thatcher's children" because the cohort grew up while [[Margaret Thatcher]] was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, "a time of social flux and transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher's children: the lives of Generation X|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/news/news-items/thatcher-s-children-the-lives-of-generation-x/|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=Economic and Social Research Council|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were described in a marketing report by ''Specialty Retail'' as the kids who "lived the [[civil rights movement]]." They were among the first children to be [[Desegregation busing|bused]] to attain [[Racial integration|integration]] in the public school system. In the 1990s, Strauss reported Gen Xers were "by any measure the least racist of today's generations".&lt;ref name="Strauss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Retail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X|url=http://specialtyretail.com/issue/2003/07/running-a-cart-or-kiosk/generation-x/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Specialty Retail|date=Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Title IX]], which passed in 1972, provided increased athletic opportunities to Gen X girls in the public school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Underwood|first1=Chuck|title=America's Generations With Chuck Underwood - Generation X|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZGuilmLcc|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Russia]], Generation Xers are referred to as "the last Soviet children", as the last children to come of age prior to the downfall of [[communism]] in their nation and prior to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="McCrindle"/&gt;

Politically, in the United States, the Gen X childhood coincided with a time when government funding tended to be diverted away from programs for children and often instead directed toward the elderly population, with cuts to [[Medicaid]] and programs for children and young families, and protection and expansion of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] for the elderly population. One in five American children grew up in poverty during this time. These programs for the elderly were not tied to economic need. Congressman [[David Durenberger]] criticized this political situation, stating that while programs for poor children and for young families were cut, the government provided "free health care to elderly millionaires".&lt;ref name="Strauss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holtz|first1=Geoffrey|title=Welcome to the Jungle: The Why Behind Generation X|year= 1995|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312132101|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2Ay28CTKlgsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=welcome+to+the+jungle+they+why+behind+generation+x#v=onepage&amp;q=welcome%20to%20the%20jungle%20they%20why%20behind%20generation%20x|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen Xers came of age or were children during the [[crack epidemic]], which disproportionately impacted urban areas and also the [[African-American]] community in the US. Drug turf battles increased violent crime, and [[Crack cocaine|crack addiction]] impacted communities and families. Between 1984 and 1989, the homicide rate for black males aged 14 to 17 doubled in the US, and the homicide rate for black males aged 18 to 24 increased almost as much. The crack epidemic had a destabilizing impact on families with an increase in the number of children in [[foster care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fryer|first1=Roland|title=Measuring Crack Cocaine and Its Impact|journal=Harvard University Society of Fellows|date=April 2006|pages=3, 66|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/fhlm_crack_cocaine_0.pdf|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yuppies, Beware: Here Comes Generation X|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/yuppies-beware-here-comes-generation-x/article_ce19c561-c82d-51b0-a0f9-0f680bc50da9.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Tulsa World|date=9 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation X was the first cohort to come of age with [[MTV]] and are sometimes called the [[MTV Generation]].&lt;ref name = "MetLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaksen 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100500/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024071508/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100500|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-24|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=Generation X|first=Judy L.|last=Isaksen|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They experienced the emergence of [[punk rock]], [[music video]]s, [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]] and [[hip hop]].&lt;ref name="My So Called Adulthood"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/the-gen-x-nostalgia-boom.html|work=New York Times|title=My So Called Adulthood|date=2011-08-04|accessdate=2011-08-25|first1=Carl|last1=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[AIDS]] coincided with Gen X's adolescence, with the disease first clinically observed in the United States in 1981. By 1985, an estimated one to two million Americans were HIV positive. As the virus spread, at a time before effective treatments were available, a public panic ensued. [[Sex education]] programs in schools were adapted to address the AIDS epidemic which taught Gen X students that sex could kill you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X Reacts to AIDS|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/generation-x/videos/gen-x-reacts-to-aids/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=National Geographic Channel|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halkitis|first1=Perry|title=The Disease That Defined My Generation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/perry-n-halkitis-phd-ms/the-disease-that-defined-_b_5881884.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen Xers were the first children to have access to [[personal computers|computers]] in their homes and schools.&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt; Generally, Gen Xers are the children of the [[Silent Generation]] and older [[Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name="Gordinier"/&gt;&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt;

===As young adults===
In the 1990s, media pundits and advertisers struggled to define the cohort, typically portraying them as "unfocused twentysomethings". A [[MetLife]] report noted: "media would portray them as the ''[[Friends Series|Friends]]'' generation: rather self-involved and perhaps aimless...but fun." &lt;ref name="MetLife"&gt;{{cite news|title=The MetLife Study of Gen X: The MTV Generation Moves into Mid-Life|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021014452/https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Time1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=David|title=Living: Proceeding With Caution|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,970634-1,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Time|date=16 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Gen Xers were sometimes referred to as 'Génération Bof' because of their tendency to use the word 'bof', which translated into English means 'whatever".&lt;ref name="McCrindle"/&gt; Gen Xers were often portrayed as [[Apathy|apathetic]] or as "[[slackers]]", a stereotype which was initially tied to [[Richard Linklater]]'s comedic and essentially plotless 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. After the film was released, "journalists and critics thought they put a finger on what was different about these young adults in that 'they were reluctant to grow up' and 'disdainful of earnest action'."&lt;ref name= "Time1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ScrIibner|first1=Sara|title=Generation X gets really old: How do slackers have a midlife crisis?|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/11/generation_x_gets_really_old_how_do_slackers_have_a_midlife_crisis/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Salon|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes of Gen X young adults also included that they were "bleak, cynical, and disaffected". Such stereotypes prompted sociological research at [[Stanford University]] to study the accuracy of the characterization of Gen X young adults as cynical and disaffected. Using the national [[General Social Survey]], the researchers compared answers to identical survey questions asked of 18–29-year-olds in three different time periods. Additionally, they compared how older adults answered the same survey questions over time. The surveys showed 18–29-year-old Gen Xers did exhibit higher levels of cynicism and disaffection than previous cohorts of 18–29-year-olds surveyed; however, they also found that cynicism and disaffection had increased among all age groups surveyed over time, not just young adults, making this a period effect, not a [[cohort effect]]. In other words, adults of all ages were more cynical and disaffected in the 1990s, not just Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X not so special: Malaise, cynicism on the rise for all age groups|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/98/980821genx.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldsters Get The Gen X Feeling|url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980729080415data_trunc_sys.shtml|accessdate=11 July 2016|publisher=SCI GOGO|date=29 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Punk====
{{main|Punk rock}}
As Generation X began to enter adolescence a new generation of rock bands arose such as the [[Ramones]], [[Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers]], [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]] in [[New York City]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and, [[Buzzcocks]] in the [[UK]], and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in [[Brisbane]]— by late-1976 these acts were generally recognized as forming the vanguard of "punk rock".  While at first the bands were not Gen Xers themselves, the fan base for the early bands was increasingly Gen X and it therefore made a significant imprint on the cohort.&lt;ref&gt;GUZMAN, RICHARD; Grunge, rap music movements of the early 1990s became Gen X’s soundtrack; | riguzman@scng.com | Press Telegram PUBLISHED: December 28, 2015 at 9:25 pm | UPDATED: September 1, 2017 at 1:04 am; [https://www.presstelegram.com/2015/12/28/grunge-rap-music-movements-of-the-early-1990s-became-gen-xs-soundtrack/] "The Gen X soundtrack was more of a mixtape that ranged from feel-good dance and pop music, to punk, glam rock, new wave, alternative and rap."&lt;/ref&gt; As 1977 approached and the first Gen Xers were solidly in their teens, punk rock became a major and highly controversial cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Punk, AllMusic -  https://www.allmusic.com/style/punk-ma0000002806 "in both the U.K. and the U.S. In America, punk remained an underground sensation, eventually spawning the hardcore and indie-rock scenes of the '80s, but in the UK, it was a full-scale phenomenon. In the U.K., the Sex Pistols were thought of as a serious threat to the well-being of the government and monarchy, but more importantly, they caused countless bands to form."&lt;/ref&gt;  It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, as well as bondage and S&amp;M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]] that have since been associated with the form.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick,John; Punk Rock Is Bullshit: How a Toxic Social Movement Poisoned Our Culture, Seattle Weekly; Wednesday, February 27, 2013 5:54pm; http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/for-those-of-us-who-grew-up-in-the-shadow-of-the/ "For those of us who grew up in the shadow of the baby boom, force-fed the misremembered vainglory of Woodstock long after most hippies had become coked-out, craven yuppies on their way to becoming paranoid neo-cons, punk rock provided a corrective dose of hard truth. Punk was ugly and ugly was true, no matter how many new choruses the boomers added to their song of self-praise. It was this perceived honesty that we, the nascent Generation X, feared and worshipped. But over time punk swelled into a Stalinistic doctrine of self-denial that stunted us. The yuppies kept sucking, but by clinging to punk we started to suck too."&lt;/ref&gt;  	
	
By 1977 the influence of punk rock music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading throughout various countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;The History and Evolution of Punk Rock Music, Updated April 10, 2018, ThoughtCo https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-punk-rock-2803345 "By the late '70s, punk had finished its beginning and had emerged as a solid musical force. With its rise in popularity, punk began to split into numerous sub-genres. New musicians embraced the DIY movement and began to create their own individual scenes with specific sounds."&lt;/ref&gt;  It generally took root in local scenes that tended to reject affiliation with the [[mainstream]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online, John H.

Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1970s punk experienced its second wave in which acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style, and Gen Xers were becoming the creators as well as the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;DANTON, ERIC R.; THE CONFLICTED MUSICAL LEGACY OF GENERATION X, Hartford Courant, November 6, 2005; https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2005-11-06-0511040334-story.html "Punk was the first musical reaction to the classic-rock ethos of the Woodstock generation. The original punk rockers were late-period boomers eager to distance themselves from the supercilious upper end of their demographic, and their music, reflecting the dour economics of the late '70s, became a template for Generation X and the ensuing "post-punk" movement that eventually birthed grunge."&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]], [[NOFX]]) and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Subhumans (British band)|Subhumans]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock.  Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk often later pursued other musical directions, resulting in a broad range of spinoffs, giving rise to genres such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]] and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]].  By the 1990s punk rock re-emerged in the mainstream, as punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands with Gen X members such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]] brought the genre widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Punk, Encyclopedia Britannica, Jon Savage
LAST UPDATED: Nov 14, 2018 https://www.britannica.com/art/punk"Punk’s full impact came only after the success of Nirvana in 1991, coinciding with the ascendance of Generation X—a new, disaffected generation born in the 1960s, many members of which identified with punk’s charged, often contradictory mix of intelligence, simplicity, anger, and powerlessness."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest. Lyrical content from the era often drew attention to a variety of social issues including afrocentric living, drug use, crime and violence, religion, culture, the state of the American economy, and the modern man's struggle. [[Conscious hip hop|Conscious]] and [[political hip hop]] tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, "In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion. Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Tricia. ''Black Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American''. Hanover: Wesleyan U, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also often an emphasis on [[black nationalism]]. Hip hop artists often talked about urban poverty and the problems of alcohol, drugs, and gangs in their communities.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s most influential song, "[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]," came out at this time; the song speaks up to the government, proclaiming that people in the ghetto have freedom of speech and rights like every other American. One line in the song, "We got to pump the stuff to make us tough from the heart"&lt;ref&gt;Public Enemy,[http://www.lyricsdepot.com/public-enemy/fight-the-power.html] Lyricsdepot, May 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; grabbed listeners' attention and gave them motivation to speak out for themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Indie films===
Gen Xers were largely responsible for the "[[Independent film|indie film]]" movement of the 1990s, both as young directors and in large part as the movie audiences fueling demand for such films.&lt;ref name = "Time2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternative Goes Mainstream"/&gt; In cinema, directors [[Kevin Smith]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Sofia Coppola]], [[John Singleton]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[David Fincher]], [[Steven Soderbergh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanson|first=Peter|title=The Cinema of Generation X: A Critical Study of Films and Directors|year=2002|publisher=McFarland and Company|location=North Carolina and London|isbn=0-7864-1334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/press/time/article.html|title=My Generation Believes We Can Do Anything |last=Time|first=Magazine|date=1998-06-09|publisher=View Askew|accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Linklater]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Linklater, ''Slacker'', St Martins Griffin, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tasker|first=Yvonne|title=Fifty Contemporary Film Directors |page= 365|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year= 2010|isbn=0415554330}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been called Generation X filmmakers.

===Workforce participation and income===

A report titled ''Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well?'' focused on the income of males 30–39 in 2004 (those born April 1964{{spaced ndash}}March 1974). The study was released on May 25, 2007 and emphasized that this generation's men made less (by 12%) than their fathers had at that same age in 1974, thus reversing a historical trend. It concluded that per year increases in household income generated by fathers/sons have slowed (from an average of 0.9% to 0.3%), barely keeping pace with inflation. "Family incomes have risen though (over the period 1947 to 2005) because more women have gone to work",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|date=1950–2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Men|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis|ref=1950 to 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Making less than dad did"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/25/pf/mobility_study/index.htm?cnn=yes|work=CNN|title=Making less than dad did|date=2007-05-25|accessdate=2010-05-03|first1=David|last1=Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; "supporting the incomes of men, by adding a second earner to the family.

''Generation Flux'' is a [[neologism]] and [[psychographic]] designation coined by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' for [[economy of the United States|American employees]] who need to make several changes in [[career]] throughout their working lives because of the chaotic nature of the job market following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Those in "Generation Flux" have birth years in the ranges of Gen X and Millennials.

===Entrepreneurship===
According to authors Michael Hais and Morley Winograd: &lt;blockquote&gt;Small businesses and the entrepreneurial spirit that Gen Xers embody have become one of the most popular institutions in America. There's been a recent shift in consumer behavior and Gen Xers will join the "idealist generation" in encouraging the celebration of individual effort and business risk-taking. As a result, Xers will spark a renaissance of [[entrepreneurship]] in economic life, even as overall confidence in economic institutions declines. Customers, and their needs and wants (including Millennials) will become the North Star for an entire new generation of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Generation X is Sparking a Renaissance in Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.beinkandescent.com/articles/942/GenX|accessdate=2013-04-22|author=Morley Winograd|author2=Michael Hais|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2015 study by [[Sage Group]] reports Gen Xers "dominate the playing field" with respect to founding [[Startup company|startups]] in the United States and Canada, with Gen Xers launching the majority (55%) of all new businesses in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 State of the Startup|url=https://www.sage.com/na/~/media/site/sagena/responsive/docs/startup/report|accessdate=6 August 2016|publisher=sage|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iudica|first1=David|title=The overlooked influence of Gen X|url=https://advertising.yahoo.com/insights/overlooked-influence-gen-x|accessdate=2 October 2016|publisher=Yahoo Advertising|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One variant is the [[Book of Tobit]].&lt;ref name="hibbard74"&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p74. New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Amadas]]'' has the title knight pay his last coins for such a burial.&lt;ref name="hibbard74"/&gt;  It appears in various fairy tales, such as the Italian ''[[Fair Brow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 725 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'' and [[Hans Christian Andersen|H. C. Andersen]]'s ''The Traveling Companion''.

'''GuestToGuest''' is the largest [[home exchange]] network. It has 270,000 [[residence]]s listed in 187 countries. It is an example of the [[barter economy]]; there is generally no [[money]] exchanged between the host and the guest.

==How it works==

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

'''Human ethology''' is the study of [[human behavior]].
[[Ethology]] as a discipline is generally thought of as a sub-category of [[biology]], though [[psychology|psychological]] theories have sprung up based on ethological ideas (e.g. [[sociobiology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[attachment theory]], and theories about [[human universals]] such as gender differences, incest avoidance, mourning, hierarchy and pursuit of possession). The bridging between biological sciences an social sciences creates an understanding on human ethology. 
 






==History==
Ethology has its roots in the study of [[evolution]], especially after evolution's increasing popularity after Darwin's detailed observations. It became a distinct discipline in the 1930s with zoologists [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Niko Tinbergen]] and Karl Von Frisch1.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hess |first1=E.H. |last2=Petrovich |first2=S.B. |title=Ethology and attachment: A historical perspective |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |date=2000 |volume=9 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;These three scientist are known as the major contributors to human ethology. They are also regarded as the fathers or founders of ethology. Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen rejected theories that relied on stimuli and learning alone, and elaborated on concepts that had not been well understood, such as [[instinct]]. They promoted the theory that evolution had placed within creatures innate abilities and responses to certain stimuli that advanced the thriving of the species. Konrad Lorenz also indicated in his earlier works that animal behavior can be a major reference for human behavior. He believed that the research and findings of animal behaviors can lead to findings of human behaviors as well. In 1943, Lorenz devoted much of his book, "Die angeborenen Formen moglicher Erfahrung" to human behavior. He designated that one of the most important factors of ethology was testing the hypothesis derived from animal behavioral studies on human behavioral studies. Due to Lorenz promoting the similarities between studying animal and human behavior, human ethology derived from the study of anima behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eibl-Eibesfeldt |first1=I. |title=Human Ethology |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other founder of ethology, [[Karl von Frisch]], received a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1973, for their overarching career discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns.

Many [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologists]] were eager to incorporate ethological principles into their theories as a way of explaining observable phenomenon in babies that could not necessarily be explained by learning or other concepts. [[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] used ethology prominently to explain aspects of infant-caretaker‍‍ attachment theory‍‍ (Ainsworth &amp; Bowlby, 1991). Some important attachment concepts related to evolution:

* Attachment has evolved because it promotes the survival of helpless infants. Primates and other animals reflexively attach themselves physically to their parent, and have some calls that elicit parental attention. Human babies have adaptively developed signaling mechanisms such as crying, babbling, and smiling. These are seen as innate and not learned behaviors, because even children born blind and deaf begin to smile socially at 6 weeks, and cry and babble. These behaviors facilitate contact with the caregiver and increase the likelihood of infant survival.
* Early signaling behaviors and the baby's tendency to look at faces rather than objects lead to attachment between the caretaker and baby that solidifies around 6–9 months of age. Bowlby theorized that this attachment was evolutionarily fundamental to human survival and is the basis for all relationships, even into adulthood.
* Adults are also adaptively bent toward attachment with infants. Typical "baby-ish" features, such as a large head and eyes in proportion to the body, and round cheeks, are features that elicit affection in adults. Many parents also form a "bond" with their newborn baby within hours of its birth, leading to a deep sense of emotional attachment with one's own offspring and increased behaviors that promote infant survival.
* Many of Bowlby's early methods relied heavily on ethological observations of children in their natural environments.

In later years, ethology played a large role in sociobiological theory and ultimately, in evolutionary psychology, which is a relatively new field of study. Evolutionary psychology combines ethology, primatology, anthropology, and other fields to study modern human behavior in relation to adaptive ancestral human behaviors.

==View on human nature‍‍==

* Humans are social animals. Just as wolves and lions create packs or hunting groups for self-preservation, humans create complex social structures, including families and nations.
* Humans are "biological organisms that have evolved within a particular environmental niche" (Miller, 2001).
* Intelligence, language, social attachment, aggression, and altruism are part of human nature because they "serve or once served a purpose in the struggle of the species to survive" (Miller, 2001).
* Children's developmental level is defined in terms of biologically based behaviors.
* Human's needs evolve based on their current environment. Human's must adapt in order to survive. Cognitive thinking and communication arose as a result of a need for cooperation amongst individuals for survival.

==View on human nature varies across ethological theorists==
* Lorenz believed that humans have an automatic, elicited nature of behavior, such as stimuli that elicit fixed action patterns.‍‍ His theory developed from the reflex model and the hydraulic or "flush toilet" model‍‍, which conceptualized behavior patterns of motivation. Certain fixed action patterns developed out of motivation for survival. Instinct is an example of fixed action patterns. Any behavior is instinctive if it is performed in the absence of learning. Reflexes can be instincts. For example, a newborn baby instinctively knows to search for and suckle its mother's breast for ‍‍nourishment. ‍‍
* Bowlby (and many other modern ethological theorists) believed that humans spontaneously act to meet the demands of their environment. They are active participants who seek out a parent, food, or a mate (i.e. an infant will seek to remain within sight of a‍‍ caretaker)‍‍.
* Vygotsky believed that the way humans think is based on the culture they are raised in and the language they are surrounded by. He emphasized that children grow up in the symbols of their culture, especially linguistic symbols. These linguistic symbols categorize and organize the world around them. This organization of the world is internalized, which influence the way they think&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomasello |first1=M |title=A Natural History of Human Thinking |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human behavior tends to change based on the environment and the surrounding challenges that individuals begin to face. Two evolutionary advances in human behavior began as a way to allow humans to communicate and collaborate together. Infrastructure theorist, Mead and Wittgenstein, theorized the creation of a collaboration in human foraging. This collaboration created social goals amongst people and also created a common ground. To coordinate their common goals,humans evolved a new type of cooperative communication. This communication was based on gestures that allowed humans to cooperate amongst themselves in order to achieve their desired goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomasello |first1=M |title=A Natural History of Human Thinking |publisher=Harvard University Press|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in behavior is seen due to the evolving of their environment. The environment demands survival and humans adapted their behavior in order to survive. In other words, this is known as the shared intentionality hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, human thinking evolved from a self-focused, individual intentionality as an adaptation for “dealing with problems of social coordination, specifically, problems presented by individuals’ attempts to collaborate and communicate with others." This evolution happened in two steps, one leading from individual to “joint intentionality” and the other from joint intentionality to “collective intentionality.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomasello |first1=M |title=A Natural History of Human Thinking |publisher=Harvard University Press|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mechanistic theories view behavior as passive. This theory argues that human behavior is in passivity through physiological drives and emotional stimuli. Unlike mechanistic theories, organismic theories view behavior as active. An organismic theory argues that an organism is active in its behavior, meaning that it decides how it behaves and initiates its own behaviors. Humans have intrinsic needs that they desire to be met. These needs provide energy for humans to act upon their needs in order to meet them, rather than being reactive to them. The active theory on human behavior treats stimuli not as a cause of behavior, but as opportunities humans can utilize to meet their demands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deci |first1=E |last2=Ryan |first2=R.M. |title=Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ethology topics==
Applied to human behavior, in the majority of cases, topical behavior results from motivational states and the intensity of a specific external stimulus. Organisms with a high inner motivational state for such a stimulus is called appetitive behavior. Other important concepts of zooethology, e.g., [[territoriality]], hierarchy, sensitive periods in [[ontogenesis]], etc., are also useful when discussing human behavior. [[Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]]'s book ''[[Human Ethology (book)|Human Ethology]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eibl-Eibesfeldt|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most important for how these concepts are applied to human behavior.

Human ethology has contributed in two particular ways to our understanding of the [[ontogeny]] of behavior in humans. This has resulted, first, from the application of techniques for the precise observation, description and classification of naturally occurring behavior and, secondly, from the ethological approach to the study of behavior, especially the development of behavior in terms of evolution. Of particular interest are questions relating to the function of a particular kind of behavior (e.g., attachment behavior) and its adaptive value. The description of the behavioral repertoire of a species, the recognition of patterns of behavioral development and the classification of established behavioral patterns are prerequisites for any comparison between different species or between organisms of a single species. The ethological approach is the study of the interaction between the organism with certain innate species-specific structures and the environment for which the organism is genetically programmed.

Invariant behavior patterns have a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] basis, mainly in [[neuron]]al structures common to all members of a species and, depending on the kind of behavior, may also be common to a [[genus]] or [[family (biology)|family]] or a whole [[order (biology)|order]], e.g., [[primate]]s, or even to a whole [[class (biology)|class]], e.g., [[mammals]]. In such structures we can retrace and follow the [[evolution]]ary process by which the environment produced structures, especially [[nervous system]]s and [[brain]]s, which generate adaptive behavior. In organisms with a high level of organization, the processes in which the ethologist is especially interested are those genetically preprogrammed motor and perceptual processes that facilitate social interaction and communication, such as facial expression and [[Speech production|vocalization]]. If we consider the most highly developed means of communication, [[language]] and [[speech]], which is found in humans alone, the question arises as to the biological foundation of this species-specific behavior and perceptual skill. The ethologist examines this question primarily from the point of view of [[ontogenetic]] development.

The main strength of human ethology has been its application of established interpretive patterns to new problems. On the basis of theories, concepts and methods that have proved successful in animal ethology, it looks at human behavior from a new viewpoint. The essence of this is the evolutionary perspective. But since ethologists have been relatively unaffected by the long history of the humanities, they often refer to facts and interpretations neglected by other social sciences. If we look back at the history of the relationship between the [[life science]]s and the [[social science]]s, we find two prevailing modes of theoretical orientation: on the one hand, reductionism, i.e., attempts to reduce human action to non-cognitive behavior; and on the other, attempts to separate human action and human society completely from the animal world. The advent of the theory of evolution in the 19th century brought no easy solution to the problem of  [[nature versus nurture|nature and nurture]], since it could still be "solved" in either a continuous or discontinuous manner. Human ethology as much as any other discipline significantly contributes to the [[obsolescence]] of such simple dichotomies.

Human Ethology has an increasing influence on the dialogue between Human Sciences and Humanities as shown for example with the book ''Being Human - Bridging the Gap between the Sciences of Body and Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medicus|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
‍‍Ethologists‍‍ study behavior using two general methods: naturalistic observation and laboratory experimentation. Ethologist's insistence on observing organisms in their natural environment differentiates ethology from related disciplines such as evolutionary psychology and sociobiology, and their naturalistic observation "ranks as one of their main contributions to psychology" (Miller, 2001). Naturalistic Observation
Ethologist believe that in order to study species-specific behaviors, a species must be observed in its natural environment. One can only understand the function of a behavior by seeing how it specifically fits into the ‍‍species‍‍ natural environment in order to fulfill a specific need. Ethologist follow a specific set of steps when studying an organism:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Ethogram || A detailed description of the behavior of a species in its natural environment
|-
| Classification || Classify behaviors according to their function (how they encourage survival).
|-
| Compare || Compare how a behavior functions in different species and how different behaviors may serve the same function in other species.
|-
| Laboratory Experiments || Determine the immediate causes of the behavior described in the first three steps.
|}

These steps fall in line with Tinbergen's (1963) "On Aims of Methods of Ethology" in which he states that all studies of behavior must answer four questions to be considered legitimate.1. function (adaptation), 2.evolution (phylogeny), 3. causation (mechanism), and 4. development (ontogeny) needed to answer in a study.

==Criticisms==
* Many of the contributions to evolutionary psychology require further explanation or elaboration. For example, stating that children acquire a behavior because they are in a "critical period" is similar to stating that they acquire conservation because they are in concrete operations stage (Miller, 2001)
* Identifying a "critical period" does not explain why humans are more sensitive to certain experiences at certain times.
* A common critique is that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.
* Evolutionary psychology has trouble developing research that can distinguish between environmental and cultural explanation and adaptive evolutionary explanations.
* Dr. Heather Adams when discussing evolutionary psychology stated "Good stuff gets buried under crap." This quote is indicating that while some evolutionary studies may be beneficial for the field, many evolutionary psychologists do not take the time to make methodologically rigorous studies and give evolutionary psychology a bad name amongst scholars.

==Diversity==
* Diversity is an important concept in ethology and evolutionary theory. This is true not only genetically, but culturally as well.
* Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals.
* The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding genetic diversity. The neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of neutral substitutions. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it.
* Cultural diversity is also important. From a cultural transmission standpoint, humans are the only animals to pass down cumulative cultural knowledge to their offspring. While chimpanzees can learn to use tools by watching other chimps around them, but humans are able to pool their cognitive resources to create increasingly more complex solutions to problems and more complex ways of interacting with their environments.
* The diversity of cultures points to the idea that humans are shaped by their environments, and also interact with environments to shape them as well. Cultural diversity arises from different human adaptations to different environmental factors, which in turn shapes the environment, which in turn again shapes human behavior. This cycle results in diverse cultural representations that ultimately add to the survival of the human species. This approach is important as a way to build a bridge between biological and social sciences, which creates a better understanding of human ethology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinde |first1=Robert A |title=Individuals, relationships and culture: Links between ethology and the social sciences. |publisher=CUP Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* One example of human diversity is sexual orientation. Ethologists have long noted that there are over 250 species of animals which display homosexual behaviors. While it seems counter-intuitive to say that this could be an adaptive trait, a closer look reveals how the genes for [[homosexuality]] can persist even if no offspring is directly created from homosexual behaviors.
* Homosexuality could decrease competition for heterosexual mates.
* Homosexual family members could increase the resources available to the children of their siblings without producing offspring to compete for those resources (the "gay uncle" theory), thus creating better chances for offspring to survive which share the homosexual relative's "gay genes." Thus there is a small but stable chance for future generations to be gay as well, even if the gay family member produces no direct descendents.

'''Ibu Pertiwi''' ({{lang-en|Mother Prithvi or [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]}})&lt;ref name=MotherEarth&gt;[http://www.ykip.org/index.asp Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916070718/http://www.ykip.org/index.asp |date=16 September 2009 }} [[Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi|YKIP]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[national personification]] of [[Indonesia]], the allegory of ''Tanah Air'' ({{lang-id|land and water}}), the Indonesian [[Motherland]]. Since prehistoric times the tribes of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] often revered earth and nature spirits as a life giving mother, a female deity of nature. After the adoption of [[Hinduism]] in the early [[1st millennium|first millennium]], this Mother figure was identified with [[Prithvi]], the Hindu mother goddess of Earth, who was thus given the name "Pertiwi".

Ibu Pertiwi is a popular theme in Indonesian patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song "[[Ibu Pertiwi (song)|Ibu Pertiwi]]" and "[[Indonesia Pusaka]]". In the national anthem "[[Indonesia Raya]]" the lyrics ''"Jadi pandu ibuku"'' ("Become the scout/guide for my mother") is a reference to Ibu Pertiwi as the mother of Indonesian people. Despite her popularity in patriotic songs and poems, her physical representations and images are rare.

The '''iceberg theory''' (sometimes known as the "'''theory of omission'''") is a style of [[writing]] (turned colloquialism) coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]]. As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.

== Background ==
Like other American writers such as  [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',&lt;ref name="Meyers p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn "like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained".&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"/&gt; In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles. As his biographer Jeffrey Meyers explains, "he objectively reported only the immediate events in order to achieve a concentration and intensity of focus—a spotlight rather than a stage".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greco-Turkish War he gained valuable writing experience that he translated to the writing of fiction. He believed fiction could be based on reality, but that if an experience were to be distilled, as he explained,  then "what he made up was truer than what he remembered".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"/&gt;

|style="text"-align: left;"|—Ernest Hemingway in ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In 1923, Hemingway conceived of the idea of a new theory of writing after finishing his short story "Out of Season". In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: "I omitted the real end [of "Out of Season"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&amp;nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.&lt;!-- expand and add quotation here --&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Hemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned "how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth."&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker also notes that the writing style of the "iceberg theory" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"/&gt;

For example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]," while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself—Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway is clear about his method: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':

{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction—your reader will see only what is above the water—but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013&lt;ref name=JennaBlum8&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, "... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... "&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in "The Art of the Short Story": "You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the "quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt; His style added to the aesthetic: using "declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became "the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century" according to biographer Meyers.&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt;

In her paper "Hemingway's Camera Eye", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it "is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Trodd"&gt;{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory "demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story" and that the reader is meant to "fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings".&lt;ref name="Trodd"/&gt;

Hemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.&lt;ref name ="Benson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, "while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Early fiction and short stories ==
Gwendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as "[[Indian Camp]]" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in "Indian Camp" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" does not mention the word "abortion", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Big Two-Hearted River" Hemingway explains "is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"/&gt; Hemingway intentionally left out something in "Indian Camp" and "Big Two-Hearted River"—two stories he considered to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story "[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night—none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's story "Big Two-Hearted River" is ostensibly about nothing, as is "A Clean Well Lighted Place", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"/&gt;

== Novels ==
Benson believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a "distance" between himself and the character he "becomes more practiced, it would seem." Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as "the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails," as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.&lt;ref name ="Benson"/&gt;

Baker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a "lyric-poetical novel" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref name= "Baker1972 pp274-255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.&lt;ref name= "Meyers1985 p445"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: "In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to "strengthen [the] iceberg".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.&lt;ref name="Baker p338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was awarded to Hemingway "for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''infinity pool''' is a [[reflecting pool|reflecting]] or [[swimming pool]], where the water flows over one or more edges, producing a visual effect of water with no boundary. Such pools are often designed so that the edge appears to merge with a larger body of water such as the ocean, or with the sky. They are often seen at resorts, estates, and in other luxurious places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hiller |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.expressnews.com/lifestyle/home-garden/article/Ready-to-take-the-pool-plunge-6160832.php |title=Ready to take the pool plunge? |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=March 27, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neal J. |last=Leitereg |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-chris-bosh-mansion-20150326-story.html |title=Chris Bosh drops price on hilltop estate in Pacific Palisades |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osborne |first=Claudia |url=http://travelingsage.com/14-enchanting-infinity-pools/ |title=14 Enchanting Infinity Pools That Are Built to Take Your Breath Away |publisher=Traveling Sage |date=March 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092440/http://travelingsage.com/14-enchanting-infinity-pools/ |archivedate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It has been claimed that the infinity pool concept originated in [[France]], and that one of the first vanishing-edge designs was the Stag Fountain at the [[Palace of Versailles]], built in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Linda G.|title=Infinity Edge Pools All the Rage|url=http://www.poolspanews.com/business/infinity-edge-pools-all-the-rage_o|accessdate=2018-04-11|work=Pool and Spa News|publisher=Hanley Wood Media|date=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, architect [[John Lautner]] has been credited as one of the first to come up with an infinity pool design in the early 1960s. He included infinity pools in various residential projects, and also created the vanishing-edge pool in the James Bond movie ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Infinity Edge Pool, Mauritius.JPG|thumb|Infinity pool in a resort in [[Mauritius]]]]
Infinity pools are very expensive and require extensive structural, mechanical, and architectural detailing.{{fact|date=February 2017}} Since they are often built in precarious locations, sound [[structural engineering]] is paramount. The high cost of these pools often arises from the elaborate foundation systems that anchor them to hillsides.{{fact|date=February 2017}}

The "infinite" edge of the pool terminates at a [[weir]] that is {{convert|1/16|to|1/4|in|0}} lower than the required pool water level. A trough or [[catch basin]] is constructed below the weir. The water spills into the catch basin, from where it is pumped back into the pool.

[[File:Japoneses no brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Brazil aboard the ''Kassato Maru''in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornalorebate.com.br/59/pov.htm], ''Jornal Orebate''&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to themselves as ''Issei'' and became known as ''[[Nipo-Brasilieros]]''.]]
{{nihongo3|"first generation"|一世|'''Issei'''}} is a [[Japanese-language]] term used by ethnic Japanese in countries in [[North America]] and [[South America]] to specify the [[Japanese people]] who were the first generation to [[immigration|immigrate]] there. Issei are born in Japan; their children born in the new country are ''[[Nisei]]'' (''ni'' '2' + ''sei'' 'generation'); and their grandchildren are ''[[Sansei]]'' (''san'' '3').

The character and uniqueness of the ''Issei'' is recognized in its social history.&lt;ref&gt;Numrich, Paul David. (2008). North [https://books.google.com/books?id=sAy1s626lE0C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=  ''American Buddhists in Social Context'', p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897.&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Peru]].

===Brazilian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Brazilians}}
Brazil is home to the largest ethnic Japanese population outside [[Japan]], numbering an estimated more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/brazil/index.html Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Japan-Brazil Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; more than that of the 1.2 million in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en US Census data 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Issei'' Japanese Brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that [[South America]]n nation.

===American ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}}
The first members of the ''Issei'' did not emigrate directly to the mainland United States, but to [[Hawaii]] (when it was American-controlled but not yet one of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the [[steamship]] ''[[City of Tokio]]'' in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its [[sugar plantation]]s. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, E. Mowbray. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OuUvlfcIGRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Transpacific+Steam&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA8,M1 ''Transpacific Steam: The Story of Steam Navigation from the Pacific Coast of North America to the Far East and the Antipodes, 1867-1941''], p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration of Japanese directly to the [[United States]] began in 1885, when "student-laborers" landed on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sakata, Yasuo. (1992). ''Fading Footsteps of the Issei,'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these emigrated to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience in order to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home. While they encountered discrimination, they also made opportunities, and many settled in California, and later in Washington and Oregon as well. 

===Canadian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Canadians}}
Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different socio-cultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"&gt;McLellan, Janet.

===Peruvian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Peruvians}}
Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the ''Issei'' Japanese Peruvians comprise a small number. Former Peruvian President [[Alberto Fujimori]] was the ''Nisei'' son of ''Issei'' immigrants from [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], [[Japan]].  Fujimori's political opponents tried unsuccessfully to prove that he was born in Japan. Persons must be native-born Peruvian citizens to qualify for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1065667.stm "Fujimori Secures Japanese Haven,"] BBC News.

=== Generations ===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numbers]] corresponding to the [[generation]] with the Japanese word for generation (''sei'' 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei,'' and ''Sansei'' which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants.&lt;ref name="IkawaFumiko" /&gt; The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (四世) and the fifth is called  ''Gosei'' (五世).  

The ''Issei,'' ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, involvement with non-Japanese, religious belief and practice, and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA59,M1  p. 59.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during World War II has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists. It encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of [[Meiji Japan]] from 1870 through 1911. Newer immigrants carry much different memories of more recent Japan. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt; The significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

In North America, since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.  The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]. Unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities in the world, these Britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.''&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issei====
The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada or the United States, is called ''Issei'' (一世).  In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use, replacing the term "immigrant" (''ijusha'').  This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves.  The term ''Issei'' represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

''Issei'' settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English.  They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings.  The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of ''Issei'' being predominantly friends with other ''Issei.''&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

Unlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

=====''Issei'' women=====
''Issei'' women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Audrey Lynn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPR33,M1  ''Women, Work and Place,'' p. xxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late ''Meiji'' Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA45,M1  p. 45.]&lt;/ref&gt; Substantive evidence of the working lives of ''Issei'' women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA58,M1  p. 58.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual, which accounts for the consistency in the way in which Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA56,M1  p. 56.]&lt;/ref&gt;—and this quality of emotional control was passed to their ''Nisei'' children.

=====Aging=====
The ''[[kanreki]]'' (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese [[rite of passage]] to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei.'' Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this  Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Mary L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/mm006n8332478691/  "A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday."] ''Journal Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology.'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (April, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese American [[photographer]] and former [[social worker]] [[Mary Koga]] documented members of her parents' generation in their twilight years. Her ''Portrait of the Issei in [[Illinois]]'' series shows Koga at ease with these people in a relaxed atmosphere.

==History==
The experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the Japanese society they left behind.  As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.

===Emigrants from Japan===
Japan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, Paul R. (1997). ''Japanese Americans: The Formation and Transformations of an Ethnic Group,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and some [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the [[Meiji era]] in order to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.

After 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. in order to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.&lt;ref name="tamuraxxxvii"&gt;Tamura, Linda. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR37,M1  ''The Hood River Issei: An Oral History of Japanese Settlers in Oregon's Hood River Valley,'' p. xxxvii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1884, emigration of working classes was permitted; and the first issei began to arrive in North and South America soon after.  For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon.  By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon.&lt;ref name="tamuraxxxvii"/&gt;  By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Tamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR38,M1  p. xxxviii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrants in America===
{{main|History of Japanese Americans|Japanese-American life before World War II|Japanese-American life after World War II}}
Few Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan.  This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many ''Issei'' arrived as laborers.  They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.

The Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice.  Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan.  If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=issei&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPP23,M1  ''Rising Sons: The Japanese American GIs Who Fought for the United States in World War II,'' p. xv.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, California's Alien Land Law prohibited non-citizens from owning land in the state, and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive [[alien land laws]].  This included the ''Issei'', Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth.  Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their ''Nisei'' children.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=issei&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA12,M1  p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans' first impression of Issei===
Americans generally viewed the ''Issei'' as a crude, ill-educated lot.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. {{citation needed|reason=No citation is given for Issei being well-educated, the numbers on their education.|date=August 2018}}

Whether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the ''Issei'' almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the ''Issei'' from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were that some young ''Issei'' committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.

===Racial segregation and immigration law===
{{main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States}}
The post-1900 cause to renew the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] became generalized protests against all [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants, including the Issei.&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, Laurie ''et al.'' [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm "Historical overview,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513165141/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} ''Japanese Americans In the Columbia River Basin,'' Washington State University web project.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many Chinese immigrants left the U.S., hostility fell on the ''Issei.'' American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading [[Anti-Japanese sentiment]]. [[White American]]s wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and [[Koreans|Korean]] pupils to join the Chinese students at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] school.&lt;ref name=densho&gt;{{citation| last=Densho and The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University| title=Reading: The Issei immigrants and Civil Rights| url=http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| accessdate=2008-04-25| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417110939/http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| archivedate=2008-04-17| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former [[President of the United States|President]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and as a result, they signed the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.

By 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of ''Nisei'', the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The ''Issei'' were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the ''Issei.''

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] represented the Issei's failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before July 1, 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Kirmura, Yukiko. (1988). [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED344810&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED344810  ''Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii,'' (abstract).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Issei,'' however, were very good at enhancing rice farming on "unusable" land. Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state. The largest ''Issei'' community settled around [[Vacaville, California]], near [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

===Internment===
{{main|Japanese Canadian internment|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Peruvian#World War II}}
When the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (''Nisei'') and their non-citizen parents (''Issei'').&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein, Leonard ''et al.'' (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cOFDhehJ68gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ethnic+Americans&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Pi3leXPmhmGdRB8CMOZjaZWxCGQ#PPA181,M1  ''Ethnic Americans: A History of Immigration,'' p. 181.]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the apology and redress for injustices were enacted by the American Congress and the Canadian Parliament in 1988, most of the ''Issei'' were dead, or too old for it to make any significant difference in lives that had been disrupted.

"'''It was a dark and stormy night'''" is an often-mocked and parodied phrase&lt;ref name="finder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/it-was-a-dark-and-stormy-night.html|title=It was a dark and stormy night|work=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to represent "the archetypal example of a florid, melodramatic style of fiction writing",&lt;ref name = "finder"/&gt; also known as [[purple prose]].

==Origin==
The phrase was first used by [[Washington Irving]] in his 1809 "A History of New York".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Washington|title=The Beauties of Washington Irving, Esq.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjMgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1830|publisher=Richard Griffin &amp; Co.|location=Glasgow|page=261|chapter=A Doleful Disaster of Anthony the Trumpeter}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its status as a catchphrase for bad writing comes from the opening sentence of [[English people|English]] novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s 1830 novel ''[[Paul Clifford]]'':&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul Clifford|last=Lytton|first=Edward Bulwer|publisher=Cassell Pub. Co|year=1830|location=New York|oclc=19091989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents — except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.}}

== Evaluations of the opening sentence ==
''[[Writer's Digest]]'' described this sentence as "the literary posterchild for bad story starters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/famous-first-lines-learn-how-to-start-a-novel|title=Famous First Lines Reveal How to Start a Novel|last=Petit|first=Zachary|date=January 18, 2013|work=Literary Digest|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''[[American Book Review]]'' ranked it as No.&amp;nbsp;22 on its "Best first lines from novels list".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbookreview.org/100bestlines.asp|title=100 Best First Lines from Novels|work=American Book Review|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the great-great-great-grandson of Bulwer-Lytton, [[Henry Lytton-Cobbold]], participated in a debate in the town of [[Lytton, British Columbia]], with Scott Rice, the founder of the International [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]]. Rice accused Bulwer-Lytton of penning "27 novels whose perfervid turgidity I intend to expose, denude, and generally make visible". Lytton-Cobbold defended his ancestor, noting that he had coined many other phrases widely used today such as "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", "[[the great unwashed]]", and "[[the almighty dollar]]", and said it was "rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Literary tragedy' of Bulwer-Lytton's dark and stormy night under debate |author=Alison Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/19/2 |newspaper=Guardian |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later usage==

===Literature===
The ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip character [[Snoopy]], in his imagined persona as the World Famous Author, always begins his novels with the phrase "It was a dark and stormy night."&lt;ref name = "about" /&gt; Cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] made Snoopy use this phrase because "it was a cliché, and had been one for a very long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Thomas C.|title=How to Read Literature Like a Professor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKeOyeZdVKwC&amp;pg=PA74|year=2003|publisher=Harper-Collins|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by Schulz, titled ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, Snoopy,'' and credited to Snoopy as author, was published by [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulz|first=Charles M.|title=My Life with Charlie Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV8NvhEX2LYC&amp;pg=PR18|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opening line in the popular 1962 novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' by [[Madeleine L'Engle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/books/07cnd-lengle.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Madeleine L'Engle, Writer of Children's Classics, Is Dead at 88|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=September 8, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It was a dark and stormy night.&lt;br /&gt;
 In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=L'Engle| first=Madeleine | title=A Wrinkle in Time | location=New York | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year=1962 | oclc=22421788}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

L'Engle biographer Leonard Marcus notes that "With a wink to the reader, she chose for the opening line of ''A Wrinkle in Time'', her most audaciously original work of fiction, that hoariest of cliches&amp;nbsp;... L'Engle herself was certainly aware of old warhorse's literary provenance as&amp;nbsp;... Edward Bulwer-Lytton's much maligned much parodied repository of Victorian purple prose, ''Paul Clifford''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Leonard |authorlink= |title=Listening for Madeleine: A Portrait of Madeleine L'Engle in Many Voices |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0374298971 |page=14}} This is an anthology of multiple biographical essays. The quote is from the introduction by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the importance of establishing the tone of voice at the beginning of fiction, Judy Morris notes that L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'' opens with "Snoopy's signature phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Judy |authorlink= |title=Writing fiction for children: stories only you can tell |url= |accessdate= |year= 2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Joni Mitchell]]'s song "Crazy Cries of Love" on her album ''[[Taming the Tiger]]'' opens with "It was a dark and stormy night". In the December 1998 issue of ''Musician'', Mitchell discusses her idea of using several cliche lines in the lyrics of multiple songs on the album, such as "the old man is snoring" in the title song ''Taming the Tiger''. Her co-lyricist, Don Fried, had read of a competition in ''The New Yorker'' to write a story opening with "It was a dark and stormy night" and was inspired to put it in the song lyrics. Mitchell states {{quote|But the second line is a brilliant deviation from the cliché: "Everyone was at the wing-ding." It's a beautiful out, but that was because it was competition to dig yourself out of a cliché hole in an original way. He never sent it in to ''The New Yorker'', but he just did it as an original exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=196|title=Joni Mitchell Library - Embrace the Tiger: Musician On-Line, December 1998|website=jonimitchell.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christian rock/ska band [[Five Iron Frenzy]] announced their reunion in 2011 by releasing the song "It Was a Dark and Stormy Night," which opens with the line.  The song was included on their 2013 album, ''[[Engine of a Million Plots]]''.

===Board game===
In the board game titled ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night'', contestants are given first lines of various famous novels and must guess their origin. Originally sold independently in bookstores in the Chicago area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bright sunny day for new game: It Was a Dark and Stormy Night |author=Ruth Solomon |url= |newspaper=Libertyville Review |date=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later picked up by the online book reading club Goodreads.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreadgames.com/|title=Goodreadgames.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing contest===
The annual [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] was formed in 1982. The contest, sponsored by the English Department at [[San Jose State University]], recognizes the worst examples of "dark and stormy night" writing. It challenges entrants to compose "the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."&lt;ref name = "about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulwer-lytton.com/about.html|title=About The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest|website=bulwer-lytton.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "best" of the resulting entries have been published in a series of paperback books, starting with ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night'' in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Scott|title=It Was a Dark and Stormy Night: The Best (?) from the Bulwer-Lytton Contest|url=https://www.amazon.com/Was-Dark-Stormy-Night-Bulwer-Lytton/dp/0140075569/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361982929&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=it+was+a+dark+and+stormy+night+1984|year=1984|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0140075564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''Jack o' Lent''' was a tradition in [[England]] in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries involving the abuse and burning of a straw effigy during the season of [[Lent]], ending with its burning on [[Palm Sunday]]. 

The effigy, made of straw or stuffed clothes,&lt;ref name=brand/&gt; was abused and stoned on [[Ash Wednesday]] while being dragged about the [[parish]]. The figure was kept until Palm Sunday, when it was burnt. Its burning was often believed to be a symbolic revenge on [[Judas Iscariot]], who had betrayed [[Christ]]. It is equally likely that the figure represented the hated winter and its destruction prepares the way for spring.&lt;ref&gt;Frood &amp; Graves p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Jack o' Lent is mentioned in [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Four Prentices of London]]'',&lt;ref name=brand&gt;Brand p.101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Merry Wives of Windsor]],'' [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[Nothing Like the Sun]]'', [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' as well as in the 1640s pamphlet, ''[[The Arraignment  Conviction and Imprisonment of Christmas]]''.

'''Jeremy Lent''' (born 1960) is an author whose writings investigate the patterns of thought that have led civilization to its current crisis of sustainability. He is the founder of the non-profit Liology Institute, which is dedicated to a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. He is the author of ''The Patterning Instinct'' and ''Requiem of the Human Soul''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Earlier in his career, Lent was the founder, chairman and CEO of the internet company [[NextCard]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=899887|title=NEXTCARD INC (Form: S-1/A, Received: 04/30/1999 09:49:46)|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Lent was born and raised in [[London]]. He graduated from the [[University College School]] and earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeremylent.com/|title=Website of Jeremy Lent – Author of The Patterning Instinct|website=Jeremy Lent  Author and Integrator|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lent left the UK to live in the United States. In 1986, he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is married and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In addition to his writing, Lent is a practitioner of meditation, [[Qigong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]. He is a Level II certified teacher of Radiant Heart Qigong.

== Career ==
Lent joined Strategic Planning Associates, a strategy consulting company based in Washington, D.C. In 1989, he joined First Deposit Corporation (later renamed [[Providian]]), a direct mail [[credit card]] company in San Francisco. Lent was named [[Chief financial officer|Chief Financial Officer]] of Providian in 1991 and left the company in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.'' October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19512">'''Muscle dysmorphia''' is a subtype of the obsessive mental disorder [[body dysmorphic disorder]], but is often also grouped with [[eating disorders]].&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monaghan-Atkinson&gt;Lee F Monaghan &amp; Michael Atkinson, ''Challenging Myths of Masculinity: Understanding Physical Cultures'' (Surrey: [[Ashgate]], 2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys-pBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=dysmorphia+megarexia p 86].&lt;/ref&gt;  In muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called "'''bigorexia'''", "'''megarexia'''", or "'''reverse [[anorexia]]'''", the delusional or exaggerated belief is that one's own body is too small, too skinny, insufficiently muscular, or insufficiently lean, although in most cases, the individual's build is normal or even exceptionally large and muscular already.&lt;ref name=Phillips2009&gt;Katharine A Phillips, ''Understanding Body Dysmorphic Disorder: An Essential Guide'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=uRTcOYgWj9cC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=muscle+dysmorphia 50–51].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leone-etal&gt;James E Leone, Edward J Sedory &amp; Kimberly A Gray, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1323298 "Recognition and treatment of muscle dysmorphia and related body image disorders"], ''Journal of Athletic Training'', 2005 Oct–Dec;'''40'''(4):352–359.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Muscle dysmorphia affects mostly males, particularly those involved in sports where body size or weight are competitive factors, becoming rationales to gain muscle or become leaner.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  The quest to seemingly fix one's body consumes inordinate time, attention, and resources, as on exercise routines, dietary regimens, and nutritional supplementation, while use of [[anabolic steroids]] is also common.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Other body-dysmorphic preoccupations that are not muscle-dysmorphic are usually present as well.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;

Although likened to [[anorexia nervosa]],&lt;ref name="Monaghan-Atkinson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J Cortese, ''Provocateur: Images of Women and Minorities in Advertising'', 4th edn (London: [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2016), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTaCCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 p 94].&lt;/ref&gt; muscle dysmorphia is especially difficult to recognize, since awareness of it is scarce and persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia typically remain very healthy-looking.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  The distress and distraction of muscle dysmorphia provoke absences from school, work, and socializing.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCallum&gt;Anonymous webpage author, [https://www.mccallumplace.com/muscle-dysmorphia.html "Muscle dysmorphia"], McCallum Place website, visited 21 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Versus other body dysmorphic disorders, rates of suicide attempts are especially high with muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"/&gt;  Muscle dysmorphia's incidence is rising, partly through recent popularization of extreme cultural ideals of men's bodies.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pope-etal&gt;Harrison G Pope Jr, Katharine A Phillips &amp; Roberto Olivardia, ''The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession'' (New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]], 2000) pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jo-LHyyIy_kC&amp;pg=PA156 156], 160,197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A rather newly recognized mental disorder, muscle dysmorphia was first conceptualized by healthcare professionals in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Pope93"&gt;Pope HG, Katz DL &amp; Hudson JI (1993), "Anorexia nervosa and 'reverse anorexia' among 108 male bodybuilders", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''34'''(6):406-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope97"&gt;Pope HG Jr, Gruber AJ, Choi P, Olivardia R &amp; Phillips KA (1997), "Muscle dysmorphia: An underrecognized form of body dysmorphic disorder", ''Psychosomatics: Journal of Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry'' '''38'''(6):548-557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tod16"&gt;Tod D, Edwards C &amp; Cranswick I (2016), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977020 "Muscle dysmorphia: Current insights"], ''Psychology Research and Behavior Management'' '''9''':179–188.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, 50% of peer-reviewed articles on it had been published in the prior five years.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; 

Although muscle dysmorphia was initially viewed as [[anorexia nervosa]]'s inverse—questing not to be small and thin, but to be large and muscular&lt;ref name="Pope93"/&gt;—later researchers fit the subjective experience to [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;  (Some debate continues.)

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognized muscle dysmorphia in 2013 with the fifth edition of the ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.  This ''DSM-5'' classifies it under body dysmorphic disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM"&gt;American Psychiatric Association, ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', Fifth Edition (Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Muscle dysmorphia is absent from the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]''' present edition, the [[ICD-10|tenth]], published in 1992.&lt;ref name="Filho16"&gt;dos Santos Filho CA, Tirico PP, Stefano SC, Touyz SW &amp; Claudino AM (2016), "Systematic review of the diagnostic category muscle dysmorphia", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''50'''(4):322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Although body dissatisfaction has been found in males as young as age six, muscle dysmorphia's onset is estimated  at usually between ages 18 and 20.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe04"&gt;McCabe MP &amp; Ricciardelli LA (2004), "Body image dissatisfaction among males across the lifespan: A review of past literature", ''Journal of Psychosomatic Research'' '''56'''(6):675-685.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to American psychiatry's ''DSM-5'', muscle dysmorphia is indicated by the diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder via "the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular", and this specifier holds even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, too, as is often the case.&lt;ref name="DSM"/&gt;

Psychologists have identified further clinical features of muscle dysmorphia, such as excess engagement in activities to increase muscularity, activities such as dietary restriction, over-exercise, and injection of growth-enhancing drugs.&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;  Persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia generally spend over three hours daily pondering increased muscularity, and feel unable to limit their weightlifting activities.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  As in anorexia nervosa, the reverse quest in muscle dysmorphia can be insatiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mosley PE|date=2009|title=Bigorexia: Bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They closely monitor their bodies and camouflage by wearing multiple clothing layers to appear larger.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

Muscle dysmorphia involves severe distress at having one's body viewed by others.&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt; Occupational and social functioning are impaired, and dietary regimes may interfere.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Patients often avoid activities, people, and places to conceal their perceived deficiency of size or muscularity.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; Roughly half of patients have poor or no insight that these perceptions are unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Cafri08"&gt;Cafri G, Olivardia R &amp; Thompson JK (2008), "Symptom characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity among males with muscle dysmorphia", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''49'''(4):374-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Patient histories reveal elevated rates of diagnoses of other mental disorders, including eating disorders, [[mood disorders]], [[anxiety disorders]], and [[substance use disorder]]&lt;ref name="Cafri08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitzeroth11"&gt;Hitzeroth V, Wessels C, Zungu-Dirwayi N, Oosthuizen P, &amp; Stein DJ (2001), "Muscle dysmorphia: A South African sample", ''Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences'' '''55'''(5):521-523.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as elevated rates of suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

==Prevalence==

Prevalence estimates for muscle dysmorphia have greatly varied, ranging from 1% to 54% of men.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Samples of gym members, weightlifters, and bodybuilders show higher prevalence than do samples from the general population.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;  Rates even higher have been found in users of anabolic steroids.&lt;ref name="Gruber99"&gt;Gruber AJ &amp; Pope HG (1999), "Compulsive weight lifting and anabolic drug abuse among women rape victims", ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' '''40'''(4):273-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Filho16"/&gt; The disorder is rare in women but does occur, and has been noted especially in female bodybuilders who also have experienced sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber99"/&gt;  Crossing cultures, muscle dysmorphia is known to occur in China, South Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="Hitzeroth11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ung00"&gt;Ung EK, Fones CS, &amp; Ang AW (2000), Muscle dysmorphia in a young Chinese male, ''Annals of the Academy of Medicine'' (Singapore) '''29'''(1):135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soler13"&gt;Soler PT, Fernandes HM, Damasceno VO, et al. (2013), "Vigorexy and levels of exercise dependence in gym goers and bodybuilders", ''Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte'' '''19'''(5):343-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutsztein04"&gt;Rutsztein G, Casguet A, Leonardelli E, López P, Macchi M, Marola ME &amp; Redondo G (2004), "Imagen corporal en hombres y su relación con la dismorfia muscular", ''Revista Argentina De Clínica Psicológica'' '''13'''(2):119-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behar10"/&gt;  Yet this may be mediated substantially by exposure to Western ideals of muscularity, as populations less exposed tend to have lower prevalence.&lt;ref name="Yang05"&gt;Yang CJ, Gray P, &amp; Pope HG Jr, (2005), "Male body image in Raiwan versus the west: Yanggang Ahiqi meets the Adonis complex", ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''162'''(2):263-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==

Although muscle dysmorphia's development is unclear, several risk factors have been identified.

*Trauma and bullying: Versus the general population, persons manifesting muscle dysmorphia are more likely to have experienced or observed traumatic events like sexual assault or domestic violence,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber99"/&gt; or to have sustained adolescent bullying and ridicule for perceived deficiencies such as smallness, weakness, poor athleticism, or intellectual inferiority.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwwards16"&gt;Edwards C, Molnar G &amp; Tod D (2017), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/men0000072 "Searching for masculine capital: Experiences leading to high drive for muscularity in men"], ''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity'' '''18'''(4)"361-371.'&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased body mass may seem to reduce the threat of further mistreatment.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivardia01"&gt;Olivardia R (2001), "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the largest of them all? the features and phenomenology of muscle dysmorphia", ''Harvard Review of Psychiatry'' '''9'''(5):254-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sociopsychological traits: Low self-esteem associates with higher levels of body dissatisfaction and of muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"&gt;Grieve FG (2007), "A conceptual model of factors contributing to the development of muscle dysmorphia", ''Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention'' '''15'''(1):63-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased body size or muscularity may seem to enhance the masculine identity.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

*Media exposure: As Western media emphasize physical attractiveness, some marketing campaigns now exploit male body-image insecurities.&lt;ref name="Cohane01"&gt;Cohane GH, &amp; Pope HG Jr (2001), "Body image in boys: A review of the literature", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''29'''(4):373-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangweth01"&gt;Mangweth B, Pope HGJ, Kemmler G, Ebenbichler C, Hausmann A, et al. (2001), "Body image and psychopathology in male bodybuilders", ''Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'' '''70'''(1):38-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope01"&gt;Pope HG Jr, Olivardia R, Borowiecki JJ 3rd &amp; Cohane GH (2001), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11408837 "The growing commercial value of the male body: A longitudinal survey of advertising in women's magazines"], ''Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'' '''70'''(4):189-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leit01"&gt;Leit RA, Pope HG Jr, &amp; Gray JJ (2001), "Cultural expectations of muscularity in men: The evolution of playgirl centerfolds", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''29'''(1):90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the past 20 years, the number of men's-fitness magazines and of partially-undressed, well-muscled men in advertisements have increased.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivardia01"/&gt;  Such media provoke bodily comparisons and pressure individuals to conform,&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt; yet increase the gap between men's perceptions of their own muscularity versus their desired muscularity.&lt;ref name="Leit02"&gt;Leit RA, Gray JJ, &amp; Pope HG Jr (2002), "The media's representation of the ideal male body: A cause for muscle dysmorphia?", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''31'''(3):334-338.&lt;/ref&gt;  In college-aged men, a strong predictor of a muscularity quest is internalization of the idealized male bodies depicted in media.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S &amp; Bridges SK (2010)m The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory, ''Body Image'' '''7'''(1):32-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parent11"&gt;Parent MC &amp; Moradi B (2011), "His biceps become him: A test of objectification theory's application to drive for muscularity and propensity for steroid use in college men", ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''58'''(2):246-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Athletic involvement: Athletes tend to share some psychological factors that may predispose to muscle dysmorphia, factors including high levels of competitiveness, need for control, and perfectionism,&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;  and athletes tend to be more critical of their own bodies and body weight.&lt;ref name="Davis91"&gt;Davis C &amp; Cowles M (1991), "Body image and exercise: A study of relationships and comparisons between physically active men and women", ''Sex Roles'' '''25'''(1-2):33-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes who also fail to achieve performance standards may resort to the extreme body-modifying measures of muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt; Involvement in sports where size, strength, and weight raise competitive advantage or lessen disadvantage, associates with muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Cohane01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung01"&gt;Chung B (2001), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11600802 "Muscle dysmorphia: A critical review of the proposed criteria"], ''Perspect Biol Med'' '''44'''(4):565–574.&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletic ideals reinforce the social ideal of muscularity.&lt;ref name="Grieve07"/&gt;  Conversely, those already disposed to muscle dysmorphia may be more likely to participate in such sports.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment of muscle dysmorphia can be stymied by a patient's unawareness that the preoccupation is disordered or by avoidance of treatment.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Scientific research on treatment of muscle dysmorphia is limited, the evidence largely in [[case reports]] and anecdotes,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; and no specific protocols have been validated.&lt;ref name="Leone-etal"/&gt;  Still, evidence supports the efficacy of [[Family Therapy|family-based therapy]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]], and pharmacotherapy with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt; Also limited is research on [[prognosis]] of the untreated.&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;

==Reclassifications==

Muscle dysmorphia's classification has been widely debated, and alternative ''DSM'' classifications have been proposed.

*Eating disorder: Many of muscle dysmorphia's traits overlap with those of eating disorders,&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffiths15"&gt;Griffiths S, Mond JM, Murray SB &amp; Touyz S (2015), "Positive beliefs about anorexia nervosa and muscle dysmorphia are associated with eating disorder symptomatology", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''49'''(9):812-820.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray13"&gt;Murray SB &amp; Touyz SW (2013), "Muscle dysmorphia: Towards a diagnostic consensus", ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''47'''(3):206-207.&lt;/ref&gt; including focus on body weight, shape, and modification,&lt;ref name="Russell13"&gt;Russell J (2013), Commentary on: "Muscle Dysmorphia: Towards a diagnostic consensus". ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' '''47'''(3):284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas body dysmorphic disorder otherwise usually lacks such dietary and exercise components.&lt;ref name="Murray13"/&gt;  Also, persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia tend to score high on the [[Eating Attitudes Test]] and [[Eating Disorder Inventory]],&lt;ref name="Nieuwoudt12"&gt;Nieuwoudt JE, Zhou S, Coutts RA &amp; Booker R (2012), "Muscle dysmorphia: Current research and potential classification as a disorder", ''Psychology of Sport and Exercise'' '''13'''(5):569-577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behar10"&gt;Behar R &amp; Molinari D (2010), "Muscle dysmorphia, body image and eating behaviors in two male populations", ''Revista Médica de Chile'' '''138'''(11):1386-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; while muscle dysmorphia and anorexia nervosa share diagnostic crossover.&lt;ref name="Murray10"&gt;Murray SB, Rieger E, Touyz SW &amp; De la GG (2010), "Muscle dysmorphia and the DSM-V conundrum: Where does it belong? A review paper", ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'' '''43'''(6):483-491.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, both muscle dysmorphia and eating disorders associate with higher impairment than does body dysmorphic disorder otherwise.&lt;ref name="Pope05"&gt;Pope CG, Pope HG, Menard W, Fay C, Olivardia R, &amp; Phillips KA (2005), "Clinical features of muscle dysmorphia among males with body dysmorphic disorder: ''Body Image'' '''2'''(4):395-400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"&gt;Foster AC, Shorter GW, &amp; Griffiths MD (2015), "Muscle dysmorphia: Could it be classified as an addiction to body image?", ''J Behav Addict'' '''4'''(1):1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And treatment for eating disorders may be effective for muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref name="Greenberg08"&gt;Greenberg ST &amp; Schoen EG (2008), "Males and eating disorders: Gender-based therapy for eating disorder recovery", ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'' '''39'''(4):464-471.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Behavioral addiction: Some researchers seek muscle dysmorphia's reclassification as a [[behavioral addiction]].&lt;ref name="Tod16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell13"/&gt;  Muscle dysmorphia's effort to maintain [[body image]] is enacted through particular activities, such as exercise, diet, and related shopping,&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt; which activities, as in behavioral addiction, are highly valued, modify mood, and may cause interpersonal conflicts.&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;  Also, tolerance to muscle building and dietary restriction can drive escalation of these activities to restore physiological or psychological effects.&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;  Further, abstinence from these activities can provoke withdrawal symptoms, and relapse into excessive engagement is apt to occur.&lt;ref name="Griffiths15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster15"/&gt;

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oral tradition''', or '''oral lore''', is a form of human [[communication]] wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'' (1985), reported statements from present generation which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out, "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannicaot/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ki-Zerbo"&gt;Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: "Methodology and African Prehistory", 1990, ''UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa''; James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-091-X}}, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; "Oral tradition and its methodology" at pages 54-61; at page 54: "Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another.  Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted."&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit [[oral history]], [[oral literature]], [[oral law]] and other knowledge across generations without a [[writing system]], or in parallel to a writing system. Religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as [[Sushruta Samhita]], hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;&lt;ref name=lopez1995p21&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world".&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

{{Quote|
The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate [[Vedic chant|mnemonic techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S. Lopez Jr. |year=1995|title= Authority and Orality in the Mahāyāna|journal= Numen|volume= 42 |number= 1|pages= 21–47|publisher= Brill Academic|jstor= 3270278}}; Quote: The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral tradition, with the first Pali Canon written many centuries after the death of the Buddha.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that the Vedas are not the product strictly of an oral tradition, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbia and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"/&gt; According to Goody, the Vedic texts likely involved both a written and oral tradition, calling it a "parallel products of a literate society".&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez1995p21"/&gt;

In ancient Greece, the oral tradition was a dominant tradition. [[Homer]]'s epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, was largely composed, performed and transmitted orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Gagarin |editor=E. Anne MacKay| title=Signs of Orality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkfRvkgDTOsC |year=1999|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-9004112735|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Kullmann |editor=E.

==Transmission==
[[File:Helsinki-Folk-singer-statue-1750.JPG|thumb|The legendary Finnish storyteller [[Väinämöinen]] with his [[kantele]]]]
Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with [[mnemonic device]]s enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include [[alliteration]], repetition, [[assonance]], and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or [[morae]] - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in [[Sanskrit prosody|Chandas]] found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2013p228"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Scharf|editor=Keith Allan|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164344-6|pages=228–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

| The law itself in oral cultures is enshrined in formulaic sayings, proverbs, which are not mere jurisprudential decorations, but themselves constitute the law. A judge in an oral culture is often called on to articulate sets of relevant proverbs out of which he can produce equitable decisions in the cases under formal litigation before him.&lt;ref name="Longman Publishers USA"/&gt;
|}

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]] provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the [[Law of the Jungle]]. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Oral Traditions|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|website=Indigenous Foundations|accessdate=5 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082618/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[śruti]]s of Hinduism called the [[Veda]]s, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref name=witzel68&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called [[Guru]]kul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''paths'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakarya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver.

===Chronology===
[[File:Filip Visnjic guslar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Filip Višnjić]] (1767&amp;ndash;1834), [[Serbia]]n blind [[gusle|guslar]]]]
The following overview draws upon ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology'', (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); ''Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and ''Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry'' (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Vuk pursued similar projects of "salvage folklore" (similar to [[rescue archaeology]]) in the [[cognate]] traditions of the Southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions which would later be gathered into [[Yugoslavia]], and with the same admixture of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalistic]] interests (he considered all those speaking the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf "Early Scholarship on Oral Traditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529035828/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}: Radloff, Jousse and Murko ''Oral Tradition'' 5:1 (1990) 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[turcology|turcologist]] [[Vasily Radlov]] (1837–1918) would study the songs of the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

===Walter Ong===
In a separate development, the [[media theory|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that [[communication|communicative]] [[Mass media|media]] shape the nature of the content conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marshall McLuhan, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy:  The Making of Typographic Man''.  University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as mentor to the [[Jesuit]], [[Walter Ong]] (1912–2003), whose interests in [[cultural history]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]] would result in ''Orality and Literacy'' (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known ''Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness'' (Cornell, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Fighting for Life:  Context, Sexuality, and Consciousness''.  Cornell University Press, Ithaca &amp; London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by [[Orality#Primary orality|primary orality]], writing, print, and the [[secondary orality]] of the electronic age.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| I style the morality of a culture totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print, 'primary orality'.  It is 'primary' by contrast with the 'secondary orality' of present-day high technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print.  Today primary culture in the strict sense hardly exists, since every culture knows of writing and has some experience of its effects.  Still, to varying degrees many cultures and sub-cultures, even in a high-technology ambiance, preserve much of the mind-set of primary orality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and Literacy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Ong's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of ''Orality and Literacy'' concerns the "[[psychodynamics]] of orality" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and literacy:  the technologizing of the word'', pp. 31-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Miles Foley===
In advance of Ong's synthesis, [[John Miles Foley]] began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field [http://illumination.missouri.edu/spr05/fol1.htm] when he compiled ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research'' in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]. He also both established both the journal ''Oral Tradition'' and founded the ''Center for Studies in Oral Tradition'' (1986) at the [[University of Missouri]]. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the [[bard]] and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography  would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate [[Linguistics]] fields (primarily [[Ancient Greek]], Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian).  Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley's key works include ''The Theory of Oral Composition'' (1988);&lt;ref&gt;John Miles Foley.  ''The Theory of Oral Composition:  History and Methodology''.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immanent Art'' (1991); ''Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song'' (1993); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (1995); ''Teaching Oral Traditions'' (1998); ''How to Read an Oral Poem'' (2002). His [http://www.pathwaysproject.org/pathways/show/HomePage Pathways Project] (2005-2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the [[Internet]].

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography." NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated,&lt;ref&gt;A. Orchard, 'Oral Tradition', ''Reading Old English Texts'', ed. K O'Brien O'Keeffe (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 101-23&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the "formulaic system"&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "Old English Formulas and Systems" ''English Studies'' 48 (1967):193-204. responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the "hard Parryist" position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry" ''Arion'' 4 (1965):295-311). Fry's model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance&lt;/ref&gt; with structural "substitution slots" for [[syntax|syntactic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[narrative]] necessity (as well as for artistic invention).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke "Verba volent, scripta manent: Oral Tradition and the Non-Narrative Genres of Old English Poetry."  Diss. Univ. of Missouri at Columbia.  DAI 52A (1991), 2137  pp. 202, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated models such as Foley's "word-type placement rules" followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic. Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 30, 31, 202n22, 207 n36, 211n43&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as "[[ring composition]]",&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "The Singer of Tales in Performance. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 55, 60, 89 108, 122n40&lt;/ref&gt; "responsion"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Alexandra Hennessey. "Oral -Formulaic Research in Old English Studies:II" ''Oral Tradition'' 3:1-2 (1988) 138-90, p. 165) Olsen cites Foley's "Hybrid Prosody and Old English Half-Lines" in ''Neophilologus'' 64:284-89 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[type-scene]]" (also called a "theme" or "typical scene"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Singer of Tales in Performance''. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 2, 7, 8n15, 17 et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples include the "Beasts of Battle"&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis P.  "The Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry."  ''Speculum'' 28 (1953):  446-67&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cliffs of Death".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "The Cliff of Death in Old English Poetry." In ''Comparative Research in Oral Traditions:  A Memorial for Milman Parry'', ed. John Miles Foley.  Columbus:  Slavica, 1987, 213-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like "the arming sequence;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zumthor|Zumthor, Paul]] "The Text and the Voice." Transl. Marilyn C. Englehardt. ''New Literary History'' 16 (1984):67-92&lt;/ref&gt; "the hero on the beach";&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Crowne, "The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 61 (1960), 371.&lt;/ref&gt; "the traveler recognizes his goal")&lt;ref&gt;Clark, George. "The Traveller Recognizes His Goal." ''Journal of English and Germanic Philolog''y, 64 (1965):645-59.&lt;/ref&gt; would show evidence of global distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  "The Arming Motif in the Iliad".  ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of [[diglossia]] ([[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]. "The Implications of Literacy. Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Bäuml]],&lt;ref&gt;Bäuml, Franz H. "Varieties and Consequences of Medieval Literacy and Illiteracy", in ''Speculum'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (1980), pp.243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eric Havelock]]).&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, Eric Alfred. ''Preface to Plato''. "Vol. 1 A History of the Greek Mind", Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the terms and concepts of "[[orality]]" and "[[literacy]]" came to be replaced with the more useful and apt "[[traditionality]]" and "[[textuality]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke. "Agon and Gnomon: Forms and Functions of the Anglo-Saxon Riddles" in ''De Gustibus: Essays for Alain Renoir''. Ed John Miles Foley. NY: Garland, 1992 110-150&lt;/ref&gt; Very large units would be defined ([[The Indo-European Return Song]])&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Immanent Art'' Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 15, 18, 20-21, 34, 45, 63-64, 64n6, 64-68,, 74n23, 75, 76, 77n28, 78, 80, 82, 82n38, 83, 87-91, 92, 93, 94, 102, 103, 104n18, 105, 109, 110n32&lt;/ref&gt; and areas outside of [[epic poetry|military epic]] would come under investigation: women's song,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Weigle|Weigle, Marta]]. "Women's Expressive Forms" in Foley, John Miles, ed. "Teaching Oral Traditions" NY:MLA 1998. pp. 298-&lt;/ref&gt; [[riddle]]s&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; and other genres.

The methodology of oral tradition now conditions a large variety of studies, not only in [[folklore]], [[literature]] and [[literacy]], but in [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Robb. "Greek Oral Memory and the Origins of Philosophy." ''The Personalist: An International Review of Philosophy'', 51:5-45.;
A study of the AG oral mentality that assumes (1) the existence of composition and thinking that took shape under the aegis of oral patterns, (2) the educational apparatus as an oral system, and (3) the origins of philosophy as we know it in the abstract intellectual reaction against the oral mentality. The opening section on historical background covers developments in archaeology and textual criticism (including Parry's work) since the late nineteenth century, with descriptions of and comments on formulaic and thematic structure. In "The Technique of the Oral Poet" (14-22), he sketches both a synchronic picture of the singer weaving his narrative and a diachronic view of the tradition developing over time. In the third part, on the psychology of performance, he discusses "the prevalence of rhythmic speech over prose; the prevalence of the event' over the abstraction'; and the prevalence of the paratactic arrangement of parts... over alternative schema possible in other styles" (23). In sympathy with Havelock (1963), he interprets Plato's reaction against the poets as one against the oral mentality and its educative process.&lt;/ref&gt; [[communication theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Communication Studies as American Studies" Daniel Czitrom  ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 42, No. 4 (Dec., 1990), pp. 678-683&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nimis, Stephen A.

This paper has to do with the challenges of globalization in modern Nigeria and the process of "culture education," a terminology used to emphasize the peculiar means and methods of instruction by which a society imparts its body of values and mores in the pursuance and attainment of the society's collective vision, aspirations, and goals. Within this framework, this paper examines the legacies of imperialism and colonization within the Nigerian educational system––particularly in reference to the teaching of folklore and oral tradition––including the destruction of indigenous knowledge systems and the continuing lack of adequate resources in African universities. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for a more fully synthesized indigenous and formal Nigerian educational system as a method of addressing postcolonial rupture.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as [[Homeric question|"unitarians" and "analysts"]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, scholars who believed [[Homer]] to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual "author function," a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick M. Combellack]],  "Milman Parry and Homeric Artistry" ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1959), pp. 193-208 . p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as "unprovable"&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R.B. Homer: Odyssey Books XIX &amp; XX,, Cambridge UP 1992 remarks on oral-formulaic diction, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, Leon. "Hearing Is Seeing: Thoughts on the History of Music and the Imagination." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 1995 79(4):581-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_folklore_research/v043/43.3oring.html Elliot Oring cites Bruchac, Joe Storytelling: Oral History or Game of 'Telephone'?"] ''American Folklore Society Newsletter'' 19/2:3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |title=Christopher Butler cites Bart Ehrman, ‘Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why’ |publisher=Christopherbutler.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105051417/http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |title=chapter4.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082630/http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great [[Epic poetry|epics]] to children's party games like "[[telephone (game)|telephone]]" or "[[Chinese whispers]]".  While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus improved the quality, stability and [[integrity]] of content transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Great Britain: Bantam, 2006 p. 118 -- Dawkins contradicts this view, however, on p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the "Hero on the Beach" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin, [[Middle English poetry]], and even an [[Iceland]]ic prose [[saga]]. J.A. Dane, in an article&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J.A. "Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme  The Hero on the Beach." ''Neophilologus'' 66:443-449&lt;/ref&gt; characterized as "polemics without rigor"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the appearance of the theme in [[Ancient Greek]] poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of "an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet."

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord's ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'', and even ''[[Beowulf]]'', influenced nearly all of the articles written on [[Homer]] and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published ''The Songs of Homer'', questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Geoffrey S. ''The Songs of Homer.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. pp88 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Parry]], in his 1966 work "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Adam. "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?"''Yale Classical Studies.''20 (1966), pp.. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with "Homer as Oral Poet", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a "pivotal" contribution, [[Larry Benson]] introduced the concept of "written-formulaic" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites "The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334-41&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dimock. "From Homer to Novi Pazar and B ack." ''Arion'', 2, iv:40-57. Reacts against the Parry-Lord hypothesis of an oral Homer, claiming that, although Lord demonstrated that the oral poet thinks in verse and offered many explanations of the various facets of the Homeric Question by recourse to the Yugoslav analogy, the difference between Homer and other, literate poets is one of degree rather than kind. Wants to rescue Homer's art from what he sees as the dangers inherent in the oral theory model.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most prominent and steadfast opponent of oral traditional theory on these grounds was [[Arthur Brodeur]], in, e.g., ''The Art of Beowulf''. Berkeley: University of California Press. 3rd printing 1969; "A Study of Diction and Style in Three Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poems." In ''Nordica et Anglica''. Ed. Allan H. Orrick. The Hague: Mouton. pp. 97-114; "Beowulf: One Poem or Three?" In ''Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies in Honor of Francis Lee Utley''. Ed. Jerome Mandel and Bruce A. Rosenberg. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, ""there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP, 1988." p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pivot language''', sometimes also called a '''bridge language''', is an [[artificial language|artificial]] or [[natural language]] used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the [[combinatorial explosion (communication)|combinatorial explosion]] of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;), rather than quadratic &lt;math&gt;\left(\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}}=\frac{n^2-n}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.

The disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when [[Hernán Cortés]] communicated with [[Mesoamerican]] Indians, he would speak Spanish to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who would speak [[Mayan language|Mayan]] to [[Malintzin]], who would speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] to the locals.

== Examples ==
{{See also|Interlingual machine translation}}
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are often used as pivot languages.  [[Interlingua]] has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Linguaphobos? Non in le UE". [Linguaphobes? Not in the EU]. ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 2006, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Esperanto]] was proposed as a pivot language in the [[Distributed Language Translation]] project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website [http://www.majstro.com/ Majstro.com].  The [[Universal Networking Language]] is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.

== In computing ==
{{see also|Intermediate language|Data conversion#Pivotal conversion}}
Pivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems.  For example, the [[internet protocol]], [[XML]] and [[high level language]]s are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.

[[Unicode]] was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.

== In machine translation (MT) ==
Current statistical machine translation ([[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]) systems use [[parallel corpora]] for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.

Pivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p &amp; p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation ([[RBMT]]) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.

Three basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) ''triangulation'', which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) ''[[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer]]'', which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) ''synthesis'', which builds a corpus of its own for system training.

The '''triangulation''' method (also called ''phrase table multiplication'') calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The '''transfer''' method (also called ''sentence translation strategy'') simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The '''synthetic''' method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.

A direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.

All three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the ''synthetic'' technique  doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.

The key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">A '''proverbial phrase''' or a '''proverbial expression''' is type of a conventional [[saying]] similar to [[proverb]]s and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed [[Expression (language)|expression]], while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arvo Krikmann]] "the Great Chain Metaphor: An Open Sezame for Proverb Semantics?", ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium:Yearbook of International Scholarship]], 11 (1994), pp. 117-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar construction is an [[idiom]]atic phrase. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a distinction between idiomatic phrase and proverbial expression. In both of them the meaning does not immediately follow from the phrase. The difference is that an idiomatic phrase involves [[figurative language]] in its components, while in a proverbial phrase the figurative meaning is the extension of its [[literal meaning]]. Some experts  classify proverbs and proverbial phrases as types of [[idiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicography: Critical Concepts (2003) R. R. K.

==Germany==
The 1840s were a decisive decade which culminated in the events of 1848 which defined a generation of Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQGMYLJRdXoC|chapter=ch. 3 A Revolutionary Generation|title=A history of modern Germany since 1815|author=Frank B.

==Israel==
The [[Second Aliyah]] generation was arguably the most important and influential [[aliyah]]. It took place between 1904 and 1914, during which approximately 40,000 Jews immigrated into Ottoman Palestine, mostly from Russia and Poland, some from Yemen. They were the generation that created the social, political and cultural foundations of the [[State of Israel]].

==Romania==
In [[Romania]], people who were born in 1989 are called the Revolution Generation, in reference to the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989 that ended the brutal Communist regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and brought [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] to Romania.

==United States of America==
Evarts Boutell Greene dated the generation of the [[American revolution]] as being from 1763 to 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYp2AAAAMAAJ|title=The revolutionary generation, 1763-1790|author=Evarts Boutell Greene|year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslavia==
The generation that came of age during or immediately after World War II and subsequent rise of communism. It is a generation marked by greater social mobility in comparison to previous period of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which permitted the large section of population to obtain education. It was also marked by rapid urbanization and industrialization of the country, with a big population shift from rural to urban areas.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to [[Orson Scott Card]] and others, "showing" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''spoken language''' is a [[language]] produced  by articulate sounds, as opposed to a [[written language]]. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An '''oral language''' or '''vocal language''' is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a [[sign language]], which is produced with the hands and face. The term "spoken language" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as "spoken", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Nora Groce (1985) ''Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hoemann (1986) ''Introduction to American sign language''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks &amp; Kempe (2012) ''Language Development''&lt;/ref&gt;

In spoken language, much of the meaning is determined by the context. That contrasts with written language in which more of the meaning is provided directly by the text. In spoken language, the truth of a proposition is determined by common-sense reference to experience, but in written language, a greater emphasis is placed on logical and coherent argument. Similarly, spoken language tends to convey subjective information, including the relationship between the speaker and the audience, whereas written language tends to convey objective information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Spoken and written language: exploring orality and literacy|year=1982|publisher=ABLEX Pub.

The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the field of [[linguistics]] the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S., &amp; Bloom, P. (1990). Natural language and natural selection. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 13, 707–784.&lt;/ref&gt; However some linguists, such as those of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague school]], argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron, P. G., &amp; Joshi, R. M. (2006). Written language is as natural as spoken language: A biolinguistic perspective. ''Reading Psychology'', 27(4), 263–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both vocal and sign languages are composed of [[word]]s. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], and often [[tone (phonology)|tone]]. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, orientations, locations movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called [[phoneme]]s. In both vocal and sign languages, words are [[grammar|grammatically]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] linked into [[phrase (grammar)|phrase]]s, [[clause (grammar)|clause]]s, and larger units of [[discourse]].

Hearing children acquire as their [[first language]] the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted) signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children.

A '''standard language''' or '''standard variety''' is either as a language [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.{{sfn|Finegan|2007|p=14}}
Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.
Standardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.
A standard [[written language]] is sometimes termed by the [[German language|German]] word ''Schriftsprache''.

A [[pluricentric language]] has multiple interacting standard varieties.{{sfn|Stewart|1968|p=534}}{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=1}}
Examples include [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].{{sfn|Clyne|1992|pp=1–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monocentric languages, such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have only one standardized version.{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=3}}

== Standardization ==

A standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.
This may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.
Alternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
A fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.
It may be codified in normative [[dictionaries]] and [[linguistic description|grammar]]s, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
Whether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'') or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=276}}
A fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or ''[[ausbau]]''.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
This variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Through this process, the standard variety acquires [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and a greater functional importance than local varieties.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}
Those varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In some cases, such as [[Standard English]], this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.
In others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]], and can proceed much more quickly.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Language standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of [[nation states]], as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|p=122}}
Different national standards derived from a [[dialect continuum]] may be regarded as different languages, even if they are [[mutually intelligible]].{{sfn|Stewart|1968}}{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
The [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], are often cited as examples.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

In other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|pp=123–124}}
In response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.
Thus after [[Norway]] became independent at the start of the 20th century, the [[Bokmål]] standard based on the speech of [[Oslo]] was felt to be too similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] by [[Ivar Aasen]], who developed a rival [[Nynorsk]] standard based on western varieties.
Similarly, when a standard was developed in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Yugoslav republic of Macedonia]] from local varieties within a continuum with [[Serbia]] to the north and [[Bulgaria]] to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].
Now known as [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is the national standard of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.{{sfn|Trudgill|1992|pp=173–174}}

==Examples==
{{see also|List of language regulators}}

===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] consists of hundreds of [[varieties of Chinese|local varieties]], many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Min Chinese|Min]].
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] and far removed from any contemporary speech.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=108–109, 245}}
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (literally "speech of officials").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133, 136}}

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on Mandarin dialects.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}
In the 1930s, [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=135}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (where it is called ''Pǔtōnghuà''  "common speech") and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan (as ''Guóyǔ'' "national language"), and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]] (as ''Huáyǔ'' "Chinese language").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=136–137}}
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=247}}

===Dutch===
Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. A process of standardisation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different [[Middle Dutch]] dialect. The dialects of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. In 1585 Antwerp [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fell]] to the Spanish army: many from the [[Southern Netherlands]] fled to the [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] (that [[Act of Abjuration|declared itself independent]] from Spain), especially to the [[County of Holland|province of Holland]], where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ | title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Smith|1996}} The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.{{sfn|Blake|1996}} The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}} Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent, such as [[General American]], [[General Australian]], etc.{{sfn|Smith|1996}}

===Greek===
The standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardised [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu".&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel|year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is official standard of the [[Irish language]]. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects.

===Italian===
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is derived from the [[Tuscan dialect]], specifically from its [[Florentine dialect|Florentine variety]] &amp;mdash; the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome|Roman dialect]]); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, {{angbr|s}} represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled {{angbr|r}} is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]). European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/ʁ/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbo-Croatian===
Four standard variants of the [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric Serbo-Croatian]] are spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all have the [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|same dialect]] basis ([[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian]]).&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |authorlink=Dalibor Brozović |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=347–380 |chapter=Serbo-Croatian as a pluricentric language |chapterurl=https://books.google.hr/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=serbo-croatian+pluricentric&amp;hl=hr#v=onepage&amp;q=serbo-croatian%20pluricentric&amp;f=false |series=Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin &amp; New York |year=1992 |oclc=24668375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kristophson, Jürgen |title=Vom Widersinn der Dialektologie: Gedanken zum Štokavischen |trans-title=Dialectological Nonsense: Thoughts on Shtokavian |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |year=2000 |issn=0044-2356 |id={{ZDB|201058-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Badurina |editor1-first=Lada |editor2-last=Pranjković |editor2-first=Ivo |editor2-link=Ivo Pranjković |editor3-last=Silić |editor3-first=Josip |title=Jezični varijeteti i nacionalni identiteti |publisher=Disput |pages=83–108 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Policentrični standardni jezik |trans-chapter=Polycentric Standard Language |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Zagreb |year=2009 |isbn=978-953-260-054-4 |oclc=437306433 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5Mtzox?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |accessdate=5 April 2013 |df= }} [http://data.onb.ac.at/rec/AC07252152 (ÖNB)].&lt;/ref&gt;, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|different languages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Tarka Sastra''' is a science of dialectics, logic and reasoning, and art of debate that analyzes the nature and source of knowledge and its validity. Sastra in [[Sanskrit]] means that which gives teaching, instruction or command. Tarka means debate or an argument. According to one reckoning, there are six sastras. Vyakarana is one of them. Four of the sastras are particularly important Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Tarka, and Vedanta.

The sastra has concepts called "[[purva paksha|poorva paksha]]" and "apara paksha". When one raises a point (poorva paksha) the other one criticizes it (apara paksha). Then the debate starts. Each one tries to support his point of view by getting various references. The meaning of the word tarka also is specific, in that it does not imply a pure logical analysis but a complex activity of discourse guided by strict definitions and goals so as to have. This concept is referred in [[Bhagawad Gita]] as "vAdaH pravadatAmasmi" (vibhooti yOga).

Tarkasamgraha which is the foundational text of logic and discourse was al the text followed as a Guidelines for discourses. Tarka may be translated as "hypothetical argument." Tarka is the process of questioning and cross-questioning that leads to a particular conclusion. It is a form of supposition that can be used as an aid to the attainment of valid knowledge.

There are several scholars well-versed in Tarka Sastras – [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820 CE), Ramanujacharya,Madhwacharya, [[Uddyotakara|Uddyotkar]] (Nyayavartik, 6th-7th century), [[Vācaspati Miśra]] (Tatparyatika, 9th century), [[Udayanacharya]] (Tatparyaparishuddhi, 10th century), [[Jayanta Bhatta]] (Nyayamanjari, 9th century), Vishwanath (Nyayasutravrtti, 17th century), and Radhamohan Goswami (Nyayasutravivaran, 18th century), [[Kumaran Asan]]. [[Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri]] and [[Sengalipuram Anantarama Dikshitar]] were specialized in Vyakarana, Mimamsa and Tarka Sastra. Also, Krishna Sastri excelled all those scholars of his contemporary period in Tarka Sastra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10207">'''Virgin boy eggs''' are a traditional dish of [[Dongyang, Zhejiang]], [[China]] in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten. Named "tong zi dan" ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 童子蛋; [[pinyin]]: ''Tóngzǐdàn''), the dish translates literally to "boy egg" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's "local [[intangible cultural heritage]]".&lt;ref name="tofu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministryoftofu.com/2011/03/boy-urine-soaked-eggs-listed-as-local-specialty-intangible-cultural-heritage/ |title=Boys’ urine-soaked eggs listed as local specialty, intangible cultural heritage &amp;#124; Ministry of Tofu 豆腐部 |publisher=Ministryoftofu.com |date=March 11, 2011 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dish is a long-standing tradition of Dongyang and its practices date back centuries. In general, China has had a long history of food preservation methods. [[Tea eggs]] were originally developed to preserve the food for long periods of time. While the boy eggs may not have necessarily had the same origin, their development comes from a similar cultural background.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; There is no good explanation for why it must be boys' urine, specifically. It has simply been so for centuries.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/virgin-boy-eggs_n_1387312.html |title=‘Virgin Boy Eggs’ Cooked In Urine Are Spring Delicacy In Dongyang, China |last1=Chan |first1=Royston |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is historically believed in the region that urine has various health benefits and was commonly ingested in ancient times.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/29/10922289-urine-soaked-virgin-boy-eggs-are-a-springtime-taste-treat-in-china |title=Urine-soaked 'virgin boy eggs' are a springtime taste treat in China |last1=Song |first1=Aly |date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=nbcnews |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; In such times, eggs were one of the only nutritional food items available to peasants and farmers. Due to Zhejiang's hilly and riverside landscapes, agriculture has been a staple in the region's culture for centuries. Although rice was the most widely grown crop, most peasants raised their own pigs and poultry on their land as well.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/117333 |title=Zhejiang |last1=Fu Hung |first1=Frederick |last2=Falkenheim |first2=Victor C. |date=March 27, 2013 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the eggs' availability to the common person and, with the supposedly added benefit of urine at the time, the virgin boy eggs grew in popularity. The dish's traditional nature stems from the historical tendency of [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food culture]] to place more care on the detailed history of a specific food. Virgin boy eggs are one example of how Chinese food culture attaches more importance to the anecdotes relating to food, such as its time of invention or the significant historical figures related to the food's invention.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1346774351|title=Functionalism Theory Applied in C-E Translation of Chinese Food Culture Text |last1=Yue |first1=Siwei |publisher=ACADEMY PUBLISHER |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs historically from the western food culture which places more importance on a dish's ingredients and the skills necessary for its preparation. Although the exact history is somewhat obscure to most official sources, the long-standing trend of Chinese food explains the people of Dongyang's loyalty to a traditional dish to which many others find an aversion.

==Preparation==
The dish is prepared by first soaking the eggs in the urine of young boys. The urine is sourced locally by each vendor. Then, the mixture is heated over a stove. After boiling, the egg shells are cracked around the entire surface of the egg. Afterwards, the eggs are placed back into the urine. The used urine is then replaced with fresh urine and the process is repeated. The soaking process allows the eggs to  become [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in the urine as they are left to simmer. The entire process is generally a day-long endeavor.&lt;ref name="tofu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; According to some recipes, different herbs may also be added to the marinade. When finished, the eggs whites have a pale golden hue and the yolks turn green.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/world/what-in-the-world/china-dongyang-eggs-urine.html?partner=bloomberg |title=Recipe for a Chinese Ritual Dish: Eggs, Time and Plenty of Urine |last1=Levin |first1=Dan |date=July 22, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin boy eggs are similar to [[century eggs]] in their curing process and historical roots, although century eggs have become much more popularly widespread and do not use urine.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Modern culture==
Virgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, "The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it. It stinks.”&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; In general, virgin boy eggs remain highly acclaimed by the people of Dongyang for both its taste and even its "fragrant" smell.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

==Health effects and folk medicine==
[[Urophagia]] has been a significant part of Chinese medicine for much of its history. In ancient times, urine was used as a means of enhancing the effects of medicine, although today, the practice is widely viewed as unsanitary by many. It is widely speculated, however, that when urine dries it crystallizes resulting in a substance similar to the Chinese medicine, [[ren zhong bai]].
