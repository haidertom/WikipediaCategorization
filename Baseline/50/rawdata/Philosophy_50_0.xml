'''Aesthetic relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] of [[beauty]] are [[relativism|relative]] to differences in perception and consideration, and [[intrinsic|intrinsically]], have no absolute [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] 

==Overview==
Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical [[relativism]], which denies any absolute standards of [[truth]] or [[morality]] as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in [[postmodern]] theory is a fragment by [[Nietzsche]], entitled "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.")

For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the women in the paintings of [[Rubens]] would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, [[body modification]] among "[[primitive culture|primitive]]" peoples is sometimes regarded as [[grotesque]] by Western society. 

Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the "external world", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his "radical scepticism" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.

Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose "nativist" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).

The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

The '''world soul''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ψυχὴ κόσμου ''psuchè kósmou'', [[Latin]]: ''anima mundi'') is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living things on the planet, which relates to our world in much the same way as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the human body.   [[Plato]] adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most [[Neoplatonic]] systems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', 30b–c, 33b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of [[eastern philosophy]] in the [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Buddha-Nature]] in [[Mahayana Buddhism]],{{fact|date=May 2016}} and in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|School of Yin-Yang]], [[Hundred Schools of Thought#Taoism|Taoism]], and [[Neo-Confucianism#World view|Neo-Confucianism]] as ''[[qi]]''.

Other resemblances can be found in the thoughts of [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] philosophers like [[Paracelsus]], and by [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Friedrich Schelling]] and in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"/"Mind"). [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] published "The Over-Soul" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a ''universal soul''. There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by [[Gaia Theory|Gaia theorists]] such as [[James Lovelock]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of "[[Chokhmah]] Ila'ah," the all-encompassing "Supernal Wisdom" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps "channeled") by a perfect [[tzaddik]] (holy man).&lt;ref&gt;Likutey Moharan I, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tzaddik attains "[[cosmic consciousness]]" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], '''aparigraha''' ({{lang-sa|अपरिग्रह}}) is the [[virtue]] of [[Non-possession|non-possessiveness]], non-grasping or non-greediness.&lt;ref name=artidhand&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigrah is the opposite of ''parigrah'', and refers to keeping the desire for possessions to what is necessary or important, depending on one's life stage and context. The [[precept]] of ''aparigraha'' is a self-restraint ([[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]) from the type of [[greed]] and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Lauricella (2013), Judging by the way animals are treated: Gandhi as a manifestation of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Gandhi Marg Quarterly, 35(4): 655–674&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of [[dāna]] (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;SC Jain (2012), Spiritual Guidance in Achieving and Sustaining Organizational Excellence, Purushartha: A Journal of Management Ethics and Spirituality, 4(2): 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Kazanas (2013), Vedic Tradition and Civilization, in On India: Self-Image and Counter-image (Editor: AN Balslev), SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-8132110927}}, pages 27-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Aparigraha is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] in Sanskrit, made of "''a-''" and "''parigrah''". The prefix "''a-''" means "non-", so "''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;parigrah''" is the opposite of "''parigrah''", so ''aparigraha'' is speech and actions that oppose and negate ''parigraha.''

The word ''parigrah'' means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others.&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt; The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes.&lt;ref name=kjain&gt;K Jain, Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 30, Issue 11, pages 139-146&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first ''[[tirthankara]]'' in [[Jainism]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-YnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;dq=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEuaq_ofnaAhUVTI8KHUgCDagQ6AEIQjAG&lt;/ref&gt;

Monier-Williams states that the word ''"parigraha"'' has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, ''Parigraha'', A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 593&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Brahmana]]s and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt; In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt;

The virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as "abstaining from accepting gifts",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm The Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali] Verse 2.30&lt;/ref&gt; "not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person", and "not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted".&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/178/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 178-182&lt;/ref&gt; The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness,&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Mathur et al (2010), New Horizons in Indian Management, {{ISBN|978-8178357119}}, page 280&lt;/ref&gt; and non-[[compulsive hoarding|possessiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers | author = Nancy Gerstein | page = 140 | year = 2005 | publisher = Pendragon | isbn = 978-0-9722809-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of "letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Taylor (2008), End-of-Life Yoga Therapy: Exploring Life and Death, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF YOGA THERAPY, No. 18, pages 97-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Jainism}}
Aparigraha is one of the virtues in [[Jainism]]. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'') and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (''parimita-parigraha'') and limiting one’s desires (''iccha-parimana'').&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt;

In Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml Aparigraha - non-acquisition], Jainism, BBC Religions&lt;/ref&gt; Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy.&lt;ref name=mjwcr&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof (Editors), Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761927297}}, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt; Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life.&lt;ref name=valueeduc&gt;MR Mehta (in Editor: P. Kapur), Value Education, Volume 1, {{ISBN|81-7835-566-3}}, pages 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]], Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt;
==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]] (II.30), ''aparigraha'' is listed as the fifth [[Yamas]] or code of self-restraint, after with  [[Ahimsa]] (nonviolence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), [[Asteya]] (not stealing), and [[Brahmacharya]] (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein and Jeanine Miller (1997), The Essence of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-0892817382}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः ॥३०॥

Non-violence, Non-falsehood, Non-stealing, Non-cheating (celibacy, chastity), and Non-possessiveness are the five Yamas. (30)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/ Yoga Sutra], Sadhana Pada, [[sutra]] 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (''yamas'', "the don'ts") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (''niyamas'', "the dos") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten ''yamas'' and ''niyamas'', these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clarke (2014), Handbook of Research on Development and Religion, Elgar Reference, {{ISBN|978-0857933577}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Hornett (2013), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and the forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer, {{ISBN|978-3642324444}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-69&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wood states,&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; ''aparigraha'' is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in "acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://yogainternational.com/article/view/non-possessiveness-let-go-of-what-keeps-you-from-moving-forward Non-Possessiveness: Let Go of What Keeps You From Moving Forward] Irene Petryszak, Yoga International (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अपरिग्रहस्थैर्ये जन्मकथंतासंबोधः ॥३९॥

With constancy of ''aparigraha'', a spiritual illumination of the how and why of motives and birth emerges. (39)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.39&lt;ref name=jw2&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/186/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Restraint from possessiveness and greed, or ''aparigraha'', leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of [[Sādhanā]], path of spiritual existence.&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; In outer world, ''aparigraha'' manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.&lt;ref&gt;KM George (2014), Toward a Eucharistic Missiology, International Review of Mission, 103(2), 309-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to charity and conservation==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Shonil A. Bhagwat, Yoga and Sustainability, The Journal of Yoga, Fall/Winter 2008, Volume 7, Number 1, pages 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.&lt;ref&gt;C. Betal (2008), CONSERVATION OF ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH YOGIC LIFESTYLE, Journal of Environmental Research And Development Vol, 2(4), pages 905-911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DK Taneja (2014), Yoga and health, Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39(2), pages 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.

==Difference from Asteya ==
[[Asteya]] is also one of the five vows taken by [[Jain]] ascetic monks to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Jainism+asteya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp8Mb9ovnaAhVL6Y8KHTyVCHkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jainism%20asteya&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Farhi (2011), Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit: A Return to Wholeness, MacMillan, {{ISBN|978-0805059700}}, pages 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120827462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Apeiron''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ɒ|n}}; {{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "(that which is) unlimited," "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/peiros2|ἄπειρον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ''a-'', "without" and {{lang|grc|πεῖραρ}} ''peirar'', "end, limit", "boundary",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pei{{=}}rar|πεῖραρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ionic Greek]] form of {{lang|grc|πέρας}} ''peras'', "end, limit, boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/ras|πέρας|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is akin to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''piramon'', meaning "boundary, circumference, surrounding".

==''Apeiron'' as an origin==
The ''apeiron'' is central to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]], a 6th-century BC [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] whose work is mostly lost.  From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (''[[arche]]'') is eternal and infinite, or boundless (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b, 23sq.&lt;DK12,A16.&gt;, Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6, 1 sq. &lt;DK 12 A11, B2.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' generated the [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world ([[cf.]] [[Heraclitus]]). Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and then it is destroyed by going back to ''apeiron'', according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Phys.'', p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK 12 A9,B1.&gt;, p. 150, 24sq.&lt;DK 12 A9.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that infinite worlds are generated from ''apeiron'' and then they are destroyed there again.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius I 3,3&lt;Pseudo-Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition and by his teacher [[Thales]] (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World Publishing Co. Cleveland and New York. pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word ''nomos'' (law) may originally have meant ''natural law'' and used later to mean man-made law.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeferry  (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700-500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted ''apeiron'' as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing [[mythical]] way of thought to the newer [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek [[city states]] during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernant (1964) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Paris. p. 128; J. P. Vernant (1982) '' The origins of Greek thought''. Ithaca, Cornell University Press. pp. 118, 128. {{ISBN|0-8014-9293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC) the first [[Greek primordial deities|primordial god]] is [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between [[Tartarus]] and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod''. Transl. H. G. Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 [http://www.sacred-tests.com/cla/hesiod/theogony/htm online]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony|last = Cornford|first = Francis|publisher = |year = 1950|isbn = |location = |pages = 95–116|work = The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can name it also [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] (having no bottom).

Alternately, Greek [[philosopher]] [[Thales]] believed that the origin or first principle was water. [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (6th century BC) probably called the water also ''Chaos'' and this is not placed at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |page=57| isbn =978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology [[Enuma Elish]] describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201}} p 58,59 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Hindu]] cosmogony which is similar to the [[Vedic]] ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.

Hesiod made an abstraction, because his original ''chaos'' is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechishe Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale. Stuttgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea). A fragment from [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 21 B 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shows the transition from ''chaos'' to ''apeiron'': "The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world of Parmenides|author=Karl.R.Popper|year=1998|publisher=Rootledge.New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&amp;pg|isbn=9780415173018}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Either ''apeiron'' meant the "spatial indefinite" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |pages=10, 110 |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas may have been influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]]:{{Quote|[...] for they [the Pythagoreans] plainly say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philolaus]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making ''apeiron'' the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap  between the existing ''mythical'' and the new ''rational'' way of thought (''rationalism''). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Mossé]] (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle.'' Edition du Seuil. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b 23sq.&lt;DK 12 A 16.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius,&lt;DK 11 A1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "What is divine? What has no origin, nor end." This probably led his student to his final decision for ''apeiron'', because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83 |isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the world==
The ''apeiron'' has generally been understood as a sort of [[Substance theory|primal chaos]]. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author= Patricia Curd |year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=77|isbn=978-0-691-01182-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Strom.'' 2, fr.179 Sandbach &lt;DK 12 A 10.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first animals were generated in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius V 19,4 &lt;DK 12 A 30.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6,6 &lt;DK 12 A 11.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.

==Interpretations==
In the commentary of [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:
{{Quote|Whence things have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained [Greek: ''kata to chreon'' means "according to the debt"]. For they give ''justice'' and ''compensation'' to one another for their ''injustice'' according to the ordering of time.}}
This fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms,&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius in Phys. p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK12a9,B1&gt;
{{Quote|Anaximander from Miletus, son of Praxiades student and descendant of Thales, said that the origin and the element of things (beings) is apeiron and he is the first who used this name for the origin (arche). He says that the origin is neither water, nor any other of the so-called elements, but something of different nature, unlimited. From it are generated the skies and the worlds which exist between them. Whence things (beings) have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained. For they give justice and compensation to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time, as he said in poetic terms. Obviously noticing the mutual changes between the four elements, he didn't demand to make one of them a subject, but something else except these. He considers that genesis takes place without any decay of this element, but with the generation of the opposites by his own movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess ''Justice'' ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]), appears to keep the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. Cleveland and New York. p. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word ''dike'' (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[adikia]]'' (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb "law and order" (''[[Eunomia (goddess)|eunomia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700–500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' ''eunomia'' is contrasted with ''[[hubris]]'' (arrogance).&lt;ref&gt;''Homer: Odyssey.'' 17.487&lt;/ref&gt; Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a ''city-state''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:
{{Quote|Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and there its destruction happens. Infinite worlds are generated and they are destructed there again. And he says (Anaximander) why this is ''apeiron''. Because only then genesis and decay will never stop.|Aetius I 3,3&lt;Ps.Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;}}
Therefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about ''apeiron'' and this is also noticed by [[Aristotle]]:
{{Quote|The belief that there is something ''apeiron'' stems from the idea that only then genesis and decay will never stop, when that from which is taken what is generated is ''apeiron''.|Aristotle, ''Physics'' 203b 18–20 &lt;DK 12 A 15.&gt;}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche (1962) ''Philosophy in the tragic age of the Greeks.''. Washington DC: Regnery, Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including [[Martin Heidegger]].

[[Werner Heisenberg]], noted for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]], arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same "primordial substance". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague [[Max Born]] called this substance ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&amp;pg=PA546|title= A Cultural History of Physics|last=Simonyi|first=Károly|author-link=Károly Simonyi|date=April 7, 2012|website=Chapter 5.5.10 ''Back to the Apeiron?''|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn= 9781568813295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in other fields, e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1946) ''History of Western Philosophy'' NY. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Bowra]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and N. York. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term ''apeiron'', but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.

There are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. ''Apeiron'' is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant "nothingless". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from ''apeiron'' must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechische Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale Stutgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The idea that the fact of existence by itself carries along an incurable guilt is Greek (''Theognis'' 327) and anybody claims that surpasses it, commits arrogance and therefore he becomes guilty. The first half of the 6th century is a period of great social instability in Miletus, the city state where Anaximander lives. Any attempt of excess leads to exaggerations and each exaggeration must be corrected. All these have to be paid according to the debt. The things give justice to one another with the process of time.}}
Justice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la Grece 1. D'Homere a Heracklite. Seminaires 1982-1983. La creation humain II''. Edition du Seuil. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Greek and Western thought==
We may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with ''apeiron'' is metaphysical (and can lead to [[monism]]), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Sullivan (1985) ''The four seasons of Greek philosophy''. Efstathiadis group. Athens. pp. 28–31 (Edition in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[paradox]] existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (''hubris'' or ''adikia'') could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (''[[Dike (mythology)|dike]]'') would destroy him to reestablish the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) The Greek experience. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. pp. 63, 89&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la grece 1. D'Homere a Heraclite. Seminaires 1982–1983. La creation Humain II''. Editions du Seuil. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philolaus]] (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ({{lang-grc|ἄπειρα}} ''apeira'', plural of ''apeiron'') and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (''apeiron'') and the limited.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK B1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar is mentioned by [[Plato]]: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Philebus]] 16c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: "God ordained that all men shall die", "Death is a common debt". The Greek word ''adikia'' (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits [[hubris]]. The relative English word ''arrogance'' (claim as one's own without justification; {{lang-la|arrogare}}), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: "Nothing in excess."

==Other pre-Socratic philosophers' ideas about ''apeiron''==
Other [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the ''apeiron''. For the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular, [[Philolaus]]), the universe had begun as an ''apeiron'', but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.  For [[Anaxagoras]], the initial ''apeiron'' had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same ''apeiron'', all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This can involve concepts championed by [[Ordinary-language philosophy|ordinary language]] philosophers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Heidegger, and others.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Architectural design values''' make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the [[Timeline of architecture|pluralism in design]] outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.

Different design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.

==Aesthetic design values==
The expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], [[Deconstructivism]], [[Post-structuralism]], [[Neoclassicism]], New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc.&lt;ref&gt;KRIEGER, P. (2004) Contextualism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STEER, L. M. (2004) Supermodernism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLORES"&gt;FLORES, C. A. H. (2004) Symbolism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking,&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.

These aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt;

A number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.

Aesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.

===Artistic aspects and self-expression===
It is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing.&lt;ref name="Gelernter"&gt;Gelernter, M. (1995). Sources of architectural form: a critical history of Western design theory. Manchester, Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like [[Expressionism]] and the [[Avant-garde]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Fedders, K. (2004). Archigram. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heynen, H. (2004). Avant-garde. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 97 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.

===The spirit of the time design value===
This design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The [[Zeitgeist|Spirit of the Times]] denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1965). Of the standard of taste: and other essays. Indianapolis, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, [[collective consciousness]] and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some  extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.&lt;ref name="BROLIN"&gt;Brolin, B. C. (2000). Architectural ornament: banishment and return. New York, Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structural, functional and material honesty design value===
Structural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc.&lt;ref name="BROLIN" /&gt; Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “[[form follows function]]”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;KAUFMANN, E. (1955) Architecture in the age of reason; baroque and postbaroque in england, italy, and france, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for.&lt;ref&gt;NESBITT, K. (1996) Theorizing a new agenda for architecture: an anthology of architectural theory 1965-1995, New York, Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;WHITELEY, N. (1993) Design for society, London, Reaktion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The simplicity and minimalism design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Minimalism|simple forms]], i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;TOY, M. (1999) EDITORIAL. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RUBY, I. &amp; RUBY, A. (2003) Essential, Meta-, Trans-. The Chimeras of Minimalist Architecture. IN RUBY, I. (Ed.) Minimal architecture. Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.&lt;ref&gt;SILVESTRIN, C. (1999) Royal Academy and AD International Forum, Something or Nothing: Minimalism in Art and Architecture 8. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and organic design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Natural building|nature]] (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs.&lt;ref&gt;ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS, H. (2003) Zoomorphic : new animal architecture, London, Laurence King Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;PEARSON, D. (2001) New organic architecture: the breaking wave, Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;

===The classic, traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value===
This value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004"&gt;BEATLEY, T. &amp; WHEELER, S. M. (2004) The sustainable urban development reader, London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is also linked to [[Vernacular architecture|regional differences]] i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ"&gt;GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ, V. (2004) Regionalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The regionalism design value===
This design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ" /&gt; In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;ABEL, C. (1997) Architecture and identity: towards a global eco-culture, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;LEFAIVRE, L. &amp; TZONIS, A. (2003) Critical regionalism: architecture and identity in a globalized world, Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social design values==
Many architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population.&lt;ref&gt;SYMES, M., ELEY, J. &amp; SEIDEL, A. D. (1995) Architects and their practices: a changing profession, Oxford, Butterworth Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.

It should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. [[Social design]] values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;JOHNSON, D. L. (2004) Rationalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.

===The social change design value===
This design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;ZIPF, C. W. (2004) Arts and crafts movement. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HUGHES, R. (1991) The shock of the new art and the century of change, London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs.&lt;ref&gt;HATCH, C. R. (1984) The scope of social architecture, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.&lt;ref name="SANOFF"&gt;SANOFF, H. (2000) Community participation methods in design and planning, New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The consultation and participation design value===
This design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve [[Participatory design|stakeholders in the design process]].&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt; This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:
#Meeting social needs and an effective use of resources.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;
#Influencing in the design process as well as awareness of the consequences etc.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PREISER, W. F. E., WHITE, E. T. &amp; RABINOWITZ, H. Z. (1988) Post-occupancy evaluation, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing relevant and up-to-date information for designers.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ZIMRING, C. M. &amp; REIZENSTEIN, J. E. (1981) A Primer on [[post occupancy evaluation]]: uses and techniques of an increasingly valued tool. Architecture (AIA Journal), 70, 52 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crime prevention design value===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels,&lt;ref&gt;PRESS, M., COOPER, R. &amp; EROL, R. (2001) Design as a tool for social policy: the case of 'design against crime'. The Fourth European Academy of Design Conference. Aveiro Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: 
#Defensible space.&lt;ref&gt;NEWMAN, O. (1972) Defensible space: crime prevention through urban design, New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN"&gt;COLQUHOUN, I. (2004) Design out crime: creating safe and sustainable communities, Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Crime prevention through environmental design.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;
#Situational crime prevention.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEKERLE, G. R. &amp; WHITZMAN, C. (1995) Safe cities: guidelines for planning, design, and management, New York ; London, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'Third world' design value===
This is based on an eagerness to help developing countries [[Architecture for Humanity|through architecture]] and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the [[Third World]]).&lt;ref&gt;SERAGELDIN, I. (1997) The architecture of empowerment a survey. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STRASSMANN, P. W. (1998) Third world housing. IN VAN VLIET, W. (Ed.) The Encyclopedia of housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;YUNUS, M. (1997) Foreword. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ÖZKAN, S. (1997) Architecture to change the world? IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental design values==
The 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THOMPSON, I. H. (2000) Aesthetic, social and ecological values in landscape architecture: a discourse analysis. Ethics, place and environment, 3, 269-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2012}} that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on [[environmental design]] has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental [[high-tech architecture]], and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D"&gt;CUFF, D. (2000) Epilogue. IN KOSTOF, S. (Ed.) ''The Architect : chapters in the history of the profession''. Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce "eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability".&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.

The environmental design values category consists of three design values.

===Green and sustainability===
This value is based on a belief that a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;MCDONALD, M. K. (2004) Sustainability and sustainable architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture''. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2002) Sustainable architecture: low tech houses, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2003) Sustainable architecture: high tech housing, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WINES, J. &amp; JODIDIO, P. (2000) Green architecture, Köln, Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-use and modification===
This is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates.&lt;ref&gt;KALNER, S. (2004) Adaptwe re-use. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999"&gt;POWELL, K. (1999) Architecture reborn: the conversion and reconstruction of old buildings, London, Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a [[Sick building syndrome|healthy living environment]].&lt;ref name="FRANK"&gt;FRANK, L. D., ENGELKE, P. O. &amp; SCHMID, T. L. (2003) Health and community design: the impact of the built environment on physical activity, Washington, DC, Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BARTON, H., TSOUROU, C. &amp; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. REGIONAL OFFICE FOR, E. (2000) Healthy urban planning: a WHO guide to planning for people, London, Published on behalf of the World Health Organization Regional.&lt;/ref&gt; Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures.&lt;ref name="FRANK" /&gt; Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.&lt;ref&gt;BAKER-LAPORTE, P., ELLIOTT, E. &amp; BANTA, J. (2001) Prescriptions for a healthy house: a practical guide for architects, builders, and homeowners, Santa Fe, InWord Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional design values==
Within both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.

This design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as [[Classicism]], Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.

The Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.

===The tradition based design value===
This relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs.&lt;ref&gt;AMUNDSON, J. A. &amp; MILLER, C. C. (2004) Classicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this design value there are three main strategies:
#Critical traditionalist/regionalist i.e. interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them in an abstracted modern vocabulary.&lt;ref name="TILMAN"&gt;TILMAN, J. T. (2004) Historicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Revivalists i.e. adhering to the most literal traditional form.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;
#Contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings “demands” it.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;

===The design value of restoration and preservation===
This is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;ROSS, M. (1996) Planning and the heritage: policy and procedures, London, E &amp; FN Spon.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TOMLAN, M. A. (2004) Historic preservation. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; These are: 
#An archaeological perspective (i.e. preserving buildings and products of historical interest).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#An artistic perspective i.e. a desire to preserve something of beauty.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#A social perspective (i.e. a desire to hold on to the familiar and reassuring).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

===The vernacular design value===
This value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;OLIVER, P. (2004) Vernacular Architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Primitivism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; The design value of [[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular]] includes key concept such as: 
#Reinvigorating tradition (i.e. evoking the vernacular).
#Reinventing tradition i.e. the search for new paradigms.
#Extending tradition i.e. using the vernacular in a modified manner.
#Reinterpreting tradition i.e. the use of contemporary idioms.&lt;ref&gt;RUDOFSKY, B. (1964) Architecture without architects: a short introduction to non-pedigree architecture, New York, Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-based design values==
This design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (1992) Discrimination by design: a feminist critique of the man-made environment, Urbana, University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEISMAN"&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (2000) Prologue: 'women's environmental rights: a manifesto'. IN BORDEN, I., RENDELL, J. &amp; PENNER, B. (Eds.) Gender space architecture: an interdisciplinary introduction. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design,&lt;ref&gt;ATTFIELD, J. (1989) Form/female follows function/male: Feminist critiques of design. IN WALKER, J. A. &amp; ATTFIELD, J. (Eds.) Design history and the history of design. London, Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; which are: 
#Gender differences related to critique and reconstruction of architectural practice and history.&lt;ref name="MORTON"&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Feminist Theory. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The struggle for equal access to training, jobs and recognition in architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;
#The focus on gender based theories for the built environment, the architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;

Designers that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment.&lt;ref name="WEISMAN" /&gt; It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.

==The economic design value==
Many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;PYE, D. (1978) The nature and aesthetics of design, London, Barrie &amp; Jenkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACKSON, L. (Ed.) (1992) Strategic study of the profession: phase 1: strategic overview, London, Royal Institute of British Architects.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'.&lt;ref&gt;BLAU, J. R. (1984) Architects and firms: a sociological perspective on architectural practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours.&lt;ref name="CUFF"&gt;CUFF, D. (1991) Architecture: the story of practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: 
#Best design works comes from offices or individual designers which are willing to put in overtime (sometimes unpaid) for the sake of the design outcome.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Good architecture and design is rarely possible within fees offered by clients.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Architects and designers should care enough about buildings or products to uphold high design standards regardless of the payment offered.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;

The 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.

==The novel design value==
It is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.&lt;ref&gt;PORTER, D. (2000) Why do architects wear black? thinking beyond the trap. IN TOFT, A. E. (Ed.) Ethics in architecture : architectural education in the epoch of virtuality. [Leuven], European Association for Architectural Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as [[Modernism]], with is emphasis on “starting from zero”.&lt;ref&gt;WOLFE, T. (1981) From bauhaus to our house, London, Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges.&lt;ref&gt;LAWSON, B. (1997) How designers think: the design process demystified, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ROWE, P. G. (1987) Design thinking, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CROSS, N. (2004) Expertise in design: an overview. Design Studies, 25, 427 - 441.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.

The design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not.&lt;ref&gt;COLLINS, P. (1971) Architectural judgement, London, Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.

==Mathematical and scientific design values==
A movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of [[Christopher Alexander]] in the 1960s, ''[[Notes on the synthesis of form]]''. Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's [[Space syntax]] and Michael Batty's work on [[Spatial analysis]]. In architecture, the four-volume work [[The Nature of Order]] by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example [[A Theory of Architecture]]  is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia.  This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.

Social and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and in by [[Nikos Salingaros]] and others in the book "Biophilic Design".

== History and ideas ==
In the PL7, Zio Nirchio ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Plato in Twelve Volumes'' cit. by PL7, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969. {{ISBN|0-674-99262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] saw the function of the [[actor]] as bogus, presenting a dangerous illusion of reality, and masking the truth of existence by the pretence of acting. [[Aristotle]], in ''[[The Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Aristotle in 23 Volumes'', Vol. PL7, translated by W. H. Fyfe. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1932. {{ISBN|0-674-99563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing ''pity and fear'' (in his view the essence of [[tragedy]]) on stage, an audience could experience a [[catharsis]] of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.

Since then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. [[Tolstoy]] was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In ''[[What is Art?]]'' he castigated now-[[Western canon|canon]]ical artists such as [[Shakespeare]], [[Goethe]] and [[Wagner]] for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.

Since the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of '[[the Arts]]' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. [[John Ruskin]] accused [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] of "flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience",&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Adam.  "A Sense of Justice: Whistler, Ruskin, James, Impressionism", ''Victorian Studies'' Volume 42, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt; and several of the ballets of [[Diaghilev]] scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.

Whistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most [[Lady Chatterley's Lover#Controversy|famous legal clashes]] between art and morality occurred when [[Penguin Books]] were taken to court over their publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Chatterley's Trial'', Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-102232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] successfully sued a magazine, ''[[Gay News]]'', under [[blasphemous libel]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[popular culture]], [[pornography]] (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the [[objectification]] of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called ''[[Copycat crimes|copycat]]'' acts in reality. An example of this was the [[Hungerford Massacre]], where a gunman was alleged by the [[tabloid press]] to have been influenced by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' series of films starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].

In September 2001, shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center Attack]], the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] said of the atrocity that it was "Lucifer's greatest work of art."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/documentation_stockhausen.htm The Stockhausen Affair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockhausen.org/message_from_karlheinz.html Stockhausen's response&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necessaryprose.com/badart.htm Bad Art: The Iraq War out of Context&lt;/ref&gt;

In purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to [[supervenience]]. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.

'''Asceticism''' is a term derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ἀσκέω, meaning "to practise strenuously," "to exercise." Athletes were therefore said to go through [[ascetic]] training, and to be ascetics.

In this usage the twofold application—to the mode of living and the results attained—which marks the later theological implication of the term is clearly discernible. From the arena of physical contests the word easily passed over to that of spiritual struggles,  and pre-[[Christian]] writers speak of the "askesis" of the soul or of virtue—the discipline of the soul, or the exercise in virtue. But the physical idea, no less than the moral, underlies the meaning of the term in medieval Christian parlance. The monastery, as the place where the required life of abstemiousness is lived under rigorous regulation and discipline, becomes the "asketerion," a word which to the classical Greek conveyed only the notion of a place reserved for physical exercise; while the monks were the "ascetikoi," the ascetics, under discipline attaining unto the perfect practise.

==Torture of the flesh==
Asceticism is indigenous to the religions which posit as fundamental the wickedness of this life and the corruption under sin of the flesh. [[Buddhism]], therefore, as well as [[Christianity]], leads to ascetic practices. Monasteries are institutions of Buddhism no less than of [[Catholic]] Christianity. The assumption, found in the views of the [[Montanists]] and others, that concessions made to the natural appetites may be pardoned in those that are of a lower degree of holiness, while the perfectly holy will refuse to yield in the least to carnal needs and desires, is easily detected also in some of the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The ideal of holiness of both the Buddhist and the Christian saint culminates in poverty and chastity; i.e., celibacy. [[Fasting]] and other disciplinary methods are resorted to curb the flesh.

Under a strict construction of the meaning of Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be extended to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with something of value, the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The [[Levitical]] code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are the truest expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.

Fasting, which plays so essential a part in the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only in the development of the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. [[Isaiah]] (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the [[Hafṭarah]] for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.

==Fasting==
Nevertheless, fasting among the Jews was resorted to in times of great distress. The [[Book of Esther]], of late date, illustrates this for the period included in the Biblical canon. Rabbinical sources prove the growing tendency to abstain from drink and food whenever memories of disaster marked the days of the synagogal calendar, or instant danger threatened the community. In the scheme of the synagogue the one fast-day of the Bible received no less than twenty-two as companions (compare [[Fasting in Judaism]]).

Still, it may be doubted whether this multiplication of fast-days can be taken as a sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of [[Robertson Smith]] (''The Religion of the Semites,'' p.&amp;nbsp;413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal on the eve of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).

==Ascetics in Talmud==
Among the Rabbis some are mentioned as great and consistent fasters. [[Rabbi Zeira]] especially is remembered for his fondness of this form of piety. Yet to make of him an ascetic would be inaccurate. He fasted that he might forget his [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]] method of teaching before emigrating to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[B. M.]] 85a). The story continues that he abstained from drink and food for the period of one hundred days, in order that hell-fire might later have no power over him. [[Simon ben YoḦai]] is depicted as an ascetic in the traditions preserved in rabbinical literature. But exposed to persecutions under the [[Hadrian]] régime, and often in danger of his life, his whole mind was of an exceptionally somber turn for a Jewish teacher. Moreover, his ascetic practices were not inspired by a consciousness of the futility of this life and its sinfulness, but by the anxiety to fulfill to the letter the Law, to "ponder on the Torah day and night". He begrudged the hours necessary for the care of the body as so many precious moments stolen from the study of the holy Law. He envied the generation of the desert who had been fed on heavenly manna, and were thus absolved from the care for their daily bread; an echo of this sentiment may be detected in the petition of [[Jesus]] for daily bread (on Simon b. YoḦai, see [[W. Bacher]], ''Ag. Tan.'' ii. 70-149).

Still, with all these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not encourage ''individual'' fasting. The ''community'' in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, and it was the duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people ([[Ta'an.]] 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the [[Nazirite|Nazir]]'s (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice ([[Num.]] vi. 11). [[Rabbi Zeira]] would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy ([[Yer.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Ber.]] ii. 5d).

The attempt has been made to explain the Biblical [[Nazarites]] as forerunners of monastic orders addicted to the practice of ascetic discipline. [[Pentateuchal]] legislation concerning them shows them to have been merely tolerated. Modern criticism explains their peculiarities as arising from motives other than those that determine the conduct of ascetics. The Biblical Nazirs, forerunners of the [[Nebi'im]] (Prophets), were Protestants against the adoption of the customs and the religious rites of the [[Canaanites]]. In their dress and mode of life they emphasized their loyalty to [[Yahweh|YHVH]], enthroned on the desert mountain. Wine and the crown of hair were sacred to the gods of the land. Their very appearance emphasized their rejection of the new deities. And in later days the number of those that took the Nazarite vow was exceedingly small. One is inclined to the opinion that no case occurred in which the Pentateuchal provisions became effective.

==Essenes not ascetics==
Nor may the [[Essenes]] be classed among the order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to lend support to the theory that would class them as such, their fundamental doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.

A stronger case against the theory that Judaism is a very uncongenial soil for the growth of Asceticism might be made out by an appeal to the later Jewish mystics, the [[Ḥasidim]] and [[Kabbalah|Cabalists]] of various forms, all ecstatic fantastics, and—this is a point that must not be overlooked—more or less strongly under the influence of distinctly non-Jewish conceits.  See below, [[#Examples of Jewish asceticism|Examples of Jewish Asceticism]].

Looking upon this life as essentially good, according to [[Gen.]] i. 31; upon the human body as a servant of the spirit, and therefore not corrupt; upon the joys of earth as God-given and therefore to be cherished with gratitude toward the divine giver; having a prayer for every indulgence in food and drink; a benediction for every new experience of whatever nature, gladsome or sad—the Jew partook with genuine zest of the good cheer of life, without, however, lapsing into frivolity, gluttony, or intemperance. His religion, that taught him to remember his dignity as one made in the image of God, and to hold his body in esteem as the temple of God's spirit within, a dwelling of the Most Holy, "a host," as [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] put it, "for the guest, the soul," kept the Jew equidistant from the pole of self-torturing pessimism, from the mortification of the flesh under the obsession of its sinfulness and foulness, and from the other pole of levity and sensuousness.

Never intemperate in drink or food, he sought and found true joy in the consecration of his life and all of its powers and opportunities to the service of his God, a God who had caused the fruit of the vine to grow and the earth to give forth the bread, a God who created the light and sent the darkness, a God who, as a [[Talmudical]] legend—one of the many with [[Elijah]] for their subject—has it, reserves paradise "for them that cause their fellows to laugh" ([[Ta'an.]] 22a). The most beautiful saying of the rabbis about Asceticism is: "Man will have to give account in the future for every lawful enjoyment offered to him which he has ungratefully refused" ([[Abba Arika|Rab]] in [[Yer.]] [[Ḳid.]], at the close); compare [[TanḦ.]], end, "The wicked in his life is considered as one dead," etc.

==Examples of Jewish asceticism==
While the dominant note of [[Judaism]] is optimism, faith in a God who delights in the happiness of His creatures and expects their grateful appreciation of His bounties—see [[Abstinence in Judaism]]—there have, nevertheless, been prevalent in Jewish life certain ascetic tendencies of which the historian must take account.

===Shammaites and Hillelites===
The two great rabbinical schools of the first pre-Christian century, the [[Shammaites]] and the [[Hillelites]], debated the question whether life was worth living or not—"ṭob le-adam shenibra mishelo nibra" ([[Moed|Er.]] 13b), and there was an unmistakable element of austerity in the teaching of many a Shammaite that favored asceticism (compare [[II Esdras]] iv. 12). While one teacher would say, "The Shekinah rests on man only amid cheerfulness that comes from duty well performed" ([[Pes.]] ii. 7a), another held the view that "there should be no unrestrained laughter in this world" ([[Berakhot (Talmud)|Ber.]] 31a).

But it was particularly with the view of fitting the soul for communion with God, or for the purpose of keeping the body sufficiently pure to allow it to come into contact with sacred objects, that many strove to avoid things that either cause intoxication or [[Levitical]] impurity, the drinking of wine ([[Lev.]] x. 9; [[Num.]] vi. 3; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] ii. 12; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] xiii. 14), or sexual intercourse, which was forbidden to the [[people of Israel]], in preparation for the [[Sinai Revelation]] ([[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] xix. 15), and to [[Moses]] during the life of communion with God ([[Deut.]] ix. 9, 18; [[I Sam.]] xxi. 5; [[Shab.]] 87a).

According to this principle the life of the ancient Ḥasidim or Perushim ([[Pharisees]]) and Ẓenu'im ([[Essenes]]) was regulated. At the same time these devotees of holiness, making "askesis" (the practise of fortitude) their special object of life,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philo]], ed. [[Thomas Mangey]], ''De Vita Contemplativa,'' ii. 475, 477, 482.&lt;/ref&gt; were naturally led to view sensual life as contaminating. [[F. C. Conybeare]]&lt;ref&gt;''About Philo's Contemplative Life,'' p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; says: "Philo's ideal was to die daily, to mortify the flesh with fasting; he only insisted that the seclusion from social life should take place at the age of fifty, the time when the Levites retired from the active duties of the Temple service".&lt;ref&gt;See all the passages in Conybeare, l.c. pp. 265-273, 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was exactly the view of the Essenes and [[Therapeutæ]] also, in whatever connection they stood to Jonadab ben Rechab and the Kenites (see [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mek.]], [[Yitro]], 2, regarding "the water-drinkers" (shote mayim), as some of these are called). [[Banus]], the eremite saint with whom [[Josephus]] passed three years of his life (Josephus, ''Vita,'' § 2), was certainly an ascetic. Likewise were [[John the Baptist]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] iii. 4 and parallels) and the early Christians, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] included, insofar as they shunned marriage as a concession to the flesh (Matt. xix. 10-12; [[I Cor.]] vii. 28-38), imbued with ascetic views. It was exactly in opposition to this tendency, so marked in early [[Christianity]], that the [[Talmudists]] denounced fasting and penitence ([[Ta'anit]] 11a, b) and accentuated the duty of cheerfulness in the [[Elijah]] legend (Ta'anit 22a). Upon the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the year 70, a veritable wave of asceticism swept over the people, and in tribute to the national misfortune various ascetic rules were instituted (see [[Bava Batra|B. B.]] 60b; [[Tosefta]] [[Soṭah]], end; [[II Esdras]] ix. 24; compare [[W. Bacher]], ''Agada der Tannaiten,'' i. 164).

===Mysticism and asceticism===
Still, mysticism, which goes hand in hand with asceticism, always had its esoteric circles. [[Judah ha-Nasi]], called "the saint," was an ascetic ([[Ket.]] 104a). Mar, the son of [[Ravina II|Rabina]], fasted throughout the whole year with the exception of the holy days and the eve of the [[Yom Kippur|Atonement Day]] ([[Pes.]] 68b). For the sake of communing with the upper world, the lower one was despised by the elect few who preserved the tradition of the [[gnosis]] and the apocalyptic mysteries.

So did the followers of [[Obadiah Abu-Isa]], the Isawites, and of [[Judah Yudghan]], the Yudghanites, at the close of the 7th century and at the beginning of the 8th, the forerunners of the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], and many prominent Karaites themselves lead ascetic lives; abstaining from meat and wine, and spending much of their time in meditation and devotion, partly in order to obtain a deeper knowledge of the [[Scriptures]], partly as mourners over [[Jerusalem]] (see Shahrastani, ''Book of Religions and Philosophical Sects,'' Haarbrücker's translation, i. 254-257; [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' iii. 417 et seq., 446 et seq.; [[Isaak Markus Jost|Jost]], ''Gesch. des Judenthums,'' ii. 350 et seq.).

To some extent, therefore, all the mystics of the [[Middle Ages]] were Ascetics, assuming or accepting for themselves the title of "Nazarites," or being called by their contemporaries "saints." This is especially true of [[Abraham ben David of Posquières]] and his circle in the 13th century, whose relation to the beginnings of the [[Kabbalah|Kabala]] can hardly be denied. Further, the currents of thought which, emanating from India, created [[Sufism]] in Persian and Mohammedan circles in the 12th and 13th centuries, exerted considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers, as may be learned from [[BaḦya]], whose ethical system, ''Ḥobot ha-Lebabot,'' oscillates between asceticism and Jewish optimism, with a decided leaning to the former (see below).

===Asceticism in Bachya===

=== Abraham ben Ḥiyya ===
Even such thinkers as opposed the ascetic view could not extricate themselves entirely from the meshes of [[Neoplatonic]] mysticism, which beheld in the flesh or in matter the source of evil. Thus [[Abraham ben Ḥiyya]] strongly refutes the Neoplatonic conception of evil as being identical with matter, and maintains against [[BaḦya]] that indulgence in fasting and other modes of penitence is not meritorious, since only he who is ruled by his lower desires may resort to asceticism as the means of curbing his passion and disciplining his soul, whereas the really good should confine himself to such modes of abstinence as are prescribed by the Law.

Nevertheless, Abraham b. Ḥiyya claims a higher rank for the saint who, secluded from the world, leads a life altogether consecrated to the service of God. He goes even so far as to advocate the state of celibacy in such cases, referring to the example of [[Moses]]—who had to abandon intercourse with his wife when receiving the laws on [[Sinai]]—to the majority of the prophets (who were, as he thinks, unmarried), and to [[Ben Azzai]] (according to [[Yeb.]] 63b). Like BaḦya, he considers that the ascetic, while leading a purer and holier life, requires less legal restraint (see his ''Hegyon ha-Nefesh,'' ed. Reifman, 16a, 32a, 37a; Rosin, ''Ethik des Maimonides,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 16; [[Moritz Güdemann]], in ''Monatsschrift,'' 1900, pp.&amp;nbsp;196–216).

Of Asher, the son of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] in [[Lunel]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]] (''Travels,'' ed. Asher, 3b) relates as eye-witness that he was an ascetic ("parush") who did not attend to any worldly business, but studied day and night, kept fasts, and never ate meat. His brother Jacob bore the title of [[Nazarite]], having also been an ascetic abstaining from wine (see [[Zunz]]'s note in Asher's ''Benjamin of Tudela,'' ii. 11, 12; [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' vi. 240, 241).

Also the whole family of [[Judah the Ḧasid of Regensburg]], of the 12th century, his father, Samuel, and his grandfather, Kalonymus of Speyer, grandson of Eliezer the Great of Worms, seem to have been a family of Ascetics (see [[H. J. Michael]], ''Or ha-Ḥayyim,'' Nos. 433, 990, 1174, 1200).

The subsequent development and growth of the [[Kabbalah|Kabala]] produced other forms of asceticism. In fact, the Ḥasid and the Ẓanua' of the medieval apocalyptic literature being a survival of [[Essenism]], ablutions and fasting were resorted to by the adepts of the Cabala as means of attaining communion with the upper world. Some of these [[Ḥasidim]] would spend the whole week—without or with interruption, according to their physical endurance—in fasting, rendering only the Sabbath a day of comfort and joy. The object of their penitences and fastings was to bring about the time of divine favor, the [[Jewish Messiah|Messianic]] era. Every Messianic movement had therefore Ascetics as leaders, such as were the [[Shabbethaians]] (see [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' iii. 307) and others (see [[Abraham ben Samuel Cohen of Lask]]). Others would refrain from eating animal food—'eber min ha-Ḥay—and, like the [[Buddhists]] or the [[Pythagoreans]] of old, live on vegetarian diet. The same is related by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] of the [[Dosithean]] sect.

=== Moses Maimonides ===
Against all these ascetic views and tendencies [[Maimonides]] raised his powerful voice, and his sober view maintained the upper hand. He admits the wholesome influence on those needing much discipline of the soul of fasting and vigils, of sexual and social abstemiousness, the self-torture of the hermit, and of the penitent who dwells in deserts and uses only coarse haircloth for the covering of his flesh; but he declares the constant use of what can at best be only a remedial measure in abnormal and unsound conditions of life to be a great folly and injurious extravagance.

Maimonides, while adopting the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] maxim of the golden middle way in all things, finds in the various restrictions of the dietary and marriage laws of the Torah a legislative system of training the people to a sobriety which makes superfluous such asceticism as the monks and the saints of other nations indulge in; nay, sinful indeed, according to the rabbinical interpretation of [[Num.]] vi. 11, which says that the priest shall "make an atonement for him [the Nazir] for that he has sinned against the person [in making his vow of abstinence]" (see [[Ned.]] 10a; Maimonides, ''Yad,'' De'ot, iii. 1, vi. 1).

Jewish hermits, living in a state of celibacy and devoting themselves to meditation, are still (circa 1906) found among the [[Falashas]]. They claim that [[Aaron]] the high priest was the first [[Nazarite]] who from the time of his consecration separated from his wife to live only in the shadow of the tabernacle. Accordingly, they join the monastic order after they have been married and have become fathers of children ([[Halévy]], ''Travels in Abyssinia,'' p.&amp;nbsp;230). According to Flad (''Abyssinische Juden,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;32 et seq.), the order founded by [[Abba Sabra]] (Halévy, ''Abba Sura'') consists altogether of eunuchs. This would indicate non-Jewish influence, of which the Falashas show many traces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">In [[healthcare]], '''Carper's fundamental ways of knowing''' is a typology that attempts to classify the different sources from which knowledge and beliefs in professional practice (originally specifically [[nursing]]) can be or have been derived.  It was proposed by Barbara A. Carper, a professor at the College of Nursing at [[Texas Woman's University]], in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carper Barbara A | year = 1978 | title = Fundamental Patterns of Knowing in Nursing | url = | journal = Advances in Nursing Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–24 | pmid = 110216 | doi=10.1097/00012272-197810000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Jasper (2003), ''Beginning reflective practice''. Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|0-7487-7117-4}}; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FKroWQSJ7z4C&amp;pg=PA93 93]–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The typology identifies four fundamental "patterns of knowing":
;Empirical: Factual knowledge from [[science]], or other external sources, that can be [[empirical]]ly verified.
;Personal: Knowledge and attitudes derived from personal [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-understanding]] and [[empathy]], including imagining one's self in the patient's position.
;Ethical: Attitudes and knowledge derived from an [[applied ethics|ethical]] framework, including an awareness of [[morality|moral]] questions and choices.
;Aesthetic: Awareness of the immediate situation, seated in immediate practical action; including awareness of the patient and their circumstances as uniquely individual, and of the combined wholeness of the situation. (Aesthetic in this sense is used to mean "relating to the here and now", from the Greek αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai''), meaning "I perceive, feel, sense";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aesthetic Aesthetic], [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; the reference is ''not'' to the [[aesthetics|consideration of beauty, art and taste]]).

The emphasis on ''different'' ways of knowing is presented as a tool for generating clearer and more complete thinking and learning about experiences, and broader self-integration of classroom education.  As such it helped crystallize Johns' (1995) framework for reflective investigation to develop [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22020226.x |last1=Johns |first1=C |title=Framing learning through reflection within Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=226–34 |year=1995 |pmid=7593941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typology has been seen as leading a reaction against over-emphasis on just empirically derived knowledge, so called "scientific nursing", by emphasising that attitudes and actions that are perhaps more personal and more intuitive are centrally important too, and equally fit for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Heath (1998), [http://www.uic.edu/classes/mhpe/mhpe494dcme/Heath-reflection%20&amp;%20knowing%20in%20Nursing.pdf Reflection and patterns of knowing in nursing]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331092953/http://www.uic.edu/classes/mhpe/mhpe494dcme/Heath-reflection%20%26%20knowing%20in%20Nursing.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}, ''Journal of Advanced Nursing'', '''27''', 1054–1089. {{doi|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.00593.x}} {{PMID|9637334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenna H, Cutliffe J, McKenna P (1999), [http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/documents/v14w16p3942.pdf Evidence-based practice: demolishing some myths] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315174339/http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/documents/v14w16p3942.pdf |date=March 15, 2012 }}.

Some philosophers {{who|date=September 2016}} believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass-energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say).  There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists.  The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics.  Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon [[counterfactual definiteness]], that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B.  It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects [[counterfactual definiteness]] for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).

The '''Centre de Recherche en Épistémologie Appliquée''' (CRÉA, Paris) — the Center for Research in Applied [[Epistemology]] — conducts research in humanities and the social sciences.  It was founded in 1982 as a center for [[cognitive science]] and epistemology as part of the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris.

From the beginning it focused on two areas:
# modeling the self-organization of [[complex system]]s related to cognition, economics and social phenomena, and
# the [[philosophy of science]], in particular the epistemology of cognitive science.

Over 20 researchers, as well as post-doctoral fellows, Ph.D. students, and visiting scholars work on interdisciplinary topics related to cognitive science, including [[cognitive neuroscience]] and cognitive economics, [[cognitive linguistics]], epistemology, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and on [[mathematical model]]s related to [[dynamic systems theory]], [[control theory]], and [[logic]].  They explore both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

An '''epiphenomenon''' (plural: '''epiphenomena''') is a secondary [[phenomenon]] that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two [[word sense|senses]],&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one that [[connotation|connotes]] known [[causality|causation]] and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

==Examples==
===Metaphysics===
{{Main|Causality}}
The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.

===Philosophy of mind and psychology===
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}
An epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In [[philosophy of mind]], [[epiphenomenalism]] is the view that [[mind|mental]] phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena.  In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can ''only'' be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon.  

The [[physical world]] operates independently of the [[mental world]] in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world.  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalist]] versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Richard]] (1963). ''Metaphysics''. First Edition. Eaglewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall.    &lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
In the more general use of the word, a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the phenomena is implied;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; This is the [[word sense|sense]] that is related to the noun ''[[epiphenomenalism]]''.

However, in [[medicine]], this relationship is typically ''not'' implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only [[correlation]], not [[causality|causation]], is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is [[association (statistics)|associated with]] Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that [[correlation does not imply causation]]. [[Medical sign|Signs]], [[symptom]]s, [[syndrome]]s (groups of symptoms), and [[risk factor]]s can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of [[breast cancer]] concurrent with taking an [[antibiotic]] is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased [[inflammation]] associated with the bacterial [[infection]] that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The [[metaphor]] of a [[tree]] is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.

===Electromagnetism===
Although [[electronics]] is said to be due to the influence of [[electron]]s, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] views these particles as secondary:
:In [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Maxwell’s theory]], [[electric charge|charge]] and [[electric current|current]] are 'epiphenomena' (secondary appearances) of underlying processes in what he termed, following [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. Indeed, Maxwell’s mature theory stays completely away from microstructure of matter and from any consideration of ‘electric substance’. Instead he proposed that certain quantities should be defined at every point in space, such that relations between them (the [[Maxwell equations]]) and functions of them (such as energy functions) determine phenomena. These quantities (the [[vector field|fields]]) may depend on microphysical events, and indeed Maxwell did expend some effort in his early papers on attempting to explain qualitatively how their relations could result in mechanical motions. However, the theory explains only large-scale phenomena, and it is not necessary to have the microscopic model in mind in order to work successfully with it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Archibald (1994) "Mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism to 1900", in ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'',  volume 2, page 1216, [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] editor, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
                
===Free will===
According to epiphenomenalism, [[free will]] having an effect on the physical world is an illusion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, Shaun]]; in: Does consciousness cause behavior? Pockett, Susan (ed.); Banks, William P. (ed.); Gallagher, Shaun (ed.); Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press, 2006. pp. 109–124. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt; as physical phenomena can only be caused by other physical phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, there is free will to cause some mental effects, allowing for [[mental discipline]] that is directed at other mental phenomena.

===Behaviorism===
Weak versions of [[behaviorism]] in [[psychology]] admit the existence of mental phenomena but not their meaningful study as causes of observable behavior and view mental phenomena as either epiphenomena or linguistic summaries, [[instrumentalism|instruments]] to examine objectively observable physical behavior.

=== Complexity ===
In the field of [[complex systems]], the term epiphenomenon tends to be used interchangeably with "emergent effect".

=== Propositional theory ===
[[Zenon Pylyshyn]] suggested a [[propositional model of cognition]] where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships.  In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sternberg|Sternberg, R.]] (2005). Cognitive psychology. 5th ed., Pearson, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object.  While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object.  There are many concepts we simply cannot envision.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Return of the mental image: are there really pictures in the brain? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 113–118. doi:10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00003-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images.  Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not [[falsifiable]].&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Explaining mental imagery: Now you see it, now you don't. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 111–112. doi: 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00004-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] takes a shareholder approach to social responsibility. This approach views shareholders as the economic engine of the organization and the only group to which the firm must be socially responsible. As such, the goal of the firm is to maximize profits and return a portion of those profits to shareholders as a reward for the risk they took in investing in the firm. He advocates that the shareholders can then decide for themselves what social initiatives to take part in rather than having their appointed executive, whom they appointed for business reasons, decide for them.

==Overview==
Friedman argued that a company should have no "[[social responsibility]]" to the public or society because its only concern is to increase profits for itself and for its shareholders and that the shareholders in their private capacity are the ones with the social responsibility. He wrote about this concept in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. In it he states that when companies concern themselves with the community rather than focusing on profits, it leads to [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectrummagazine.org/articles/column/2009/01/23/adam_smith_selfishness_or_selfinterest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204093307/http://www.spectrummagazine.org/articles/column/2009/01/23/adam_smith_selfishness_or_selfinterest |archivedate=2010-12-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html|title=A Friednzan doctrine‐|first=Fulton|last=Friedman|date=13 September 1970|website=Select.nytimes.com|accessdate=3 September 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Friedman writes: "There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html|title=The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits, by Milton Friedman|website=Colorado.edu|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the stockholder theory, some argue{{who|date=October 2017}}, is inconsistent with the idea of [[corporate social responsibility]] at the cost of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2311&amp;context=facpub|title=The Shareholder Value Myth|last=Stout|first=Lynn|date=|website=Scholarship.law.cornell.edu|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company donating services or goods to help those hurt in a natural disaster, in some ways, may be considered not taking action in the best interest of the shareholder. Instead Friedman argues that shareholders should themselves decide how much and to whom they would like to make donations.  Some may argue that goods provided to society in a time of need build further allegiance to a corporation and in theory, meet the stockholder theory's requirement to look in the best interest of the stockholder.

The Friedman doctrine is controversial. In [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] social activist [[Naomi Klein]]'s book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'', she criticizes the theory, saying most citizens become impoverished while corporate elites gain enormous wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/254550 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013194030/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/254550 |archivedate=2012-10-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Geist''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaɪst}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun with a degree of importance in [[German philosophy]]. Its [[semantic field]] corresponds to English [[ghost]], [[spirit]], [[mind]], [[intellect]]. Some English translators resort to using "spirit/mind" or "spirit (mind)" to help convey the meaning of the term.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marvin Pate. ''From Plato to Jesus: What Does Philosophy Have to Do with Theology?''. 2011, page 69.
Rosenkranz, Karl. ''Hegel, as the national philosopher of Germany''. 1874, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Geist'' is also a central concept in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s 1807 ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes''). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of [[world history]] of the late 18th century, include  '''''Weltgeist''''' "world-spirit", '''''Volksgeist''''' "national spirit"  and  '''''Zeitgeist'''''   "spirit of the age".

==Etymology and translation==
{{see|Spirit|Pneuma|Psyche (psychology)}}
German ''Geist'' (masculine gender) continues [[Old High German]] ''geist'', attested as the translation of Latin ''spiritus''. 
It is the direct cognate of English ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'', from a [[West Germanic]] ''gaistaz''. Its derivation from a [[PIE root]] ''g̑heis-'' "to be agitated, frightened" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening  (c.f. English [[:wikt:ghastly|ghastly]]) apparitions or [[ghost]]s, and may also have carried the connotation of "ecstatic agitation, ''[[odhr|furor]]''" related to the cult of [[Germanic Mercury]]. 
As the translation of biblical Latin ''spiritus'' (Greek πνεῦμα) "[[pneuma|spirit, breath]]" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the [[Holy Spirit]] (Old English ''sē hālga gāst'' "the Holy Ghost", OHG '' ther heilago geist'', Modern German ''der Heilige Geist'').
The English word is in competition with Latinate ''spirit'' from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;As observed by [[Alexander Gil]], ''The sacred philosophy of the holy scripture: laid down... in... the apostles'' (1635): "The word Ghost in English [...] is as much as athem, or breath; in our new Latin language, a Spirit." Spenser in 1590 could still say ''No knight so rude, I weene, As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost'' (''[[Faerie Queene]]'' II. viii. 26), by "sleeping ghost" referring to the sleeping mind of a living person, not the ghost of a deceased one.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German noun much like English ''spirit'' could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead,  to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the "spirit of wine", i.e. [[ethanol]]. 
However, its special meaning of "[[mind]], [[intellect]]" never shared by English ''ghost'' is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French ''esprit''.
In this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.
''Geist'' could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.
It is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of ''geistlich'' "spiritual, pertaining to religion" vs. ''geistig'' "intellectual, pertaining to the mind" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts  is made by the adjective ''geisterhaft'' "ghostly, spectral".&lt;ref name=Pfeifer&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Geist#et-1 Geist] in Wolfgang Pfeifer, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch'' ([1989] 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[German compounds|compounds]] are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as ''Geistesgegenwart'' = ''présence d'esprit'' ("mental presence, acuity"), ''Geistesabwesenheit'' = ''absence d’esprit'' ("mental absence,  distraction"), ''geisteskrank'' "mentally ill", ''geistreich'' "witty, intellectually brilliant", ''geistlos'' "unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous" etc. 
It is from these developments that certain German compounds containing ''-geist'' have been loaned into English, such as ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

German ''Geist'' in this particular sense of "mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain ''Geist'' as a German loanword.

== Hegelianism ==
''Geist'' is a central concept in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes'').  According to Hegel, the ''Weltgeist'' ("world spirit") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  ''Weltgeist'' is effected in history through the [[mediation]] of various ''[[Volksgeist]]er'' ("national spirits"), the [[hero|great men]] of history, such as [[Napoleon]], are the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This has led some to claim that Hegel favored the [[great man theory]], although his [[philosophy of history]], in particular concerning the role of the "[[universality (philosophy)|universal]] state" (''Universalstaat'', which means a universal "order" or "statute" rather than "[[State (polity)|state]]"), and of an "End of History" is much more complex.

For Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by ''Geist'' or ''absolute spirit'', by a "ruse of reason" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the [[teleology|teleological]] principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.

''Weltgeist'', the world spirit concept, designates an [[idealism|idealistic]] principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained [[objective reality]] as its product. (See [[metaphysical objectivism]]) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all paid homage, amongst other things, to the [[concept]] of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.

==''Weltgeist''==
{{see|Anima Mundi}}
''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of "secularism, impiety, irreligiosity" (''spiritus mundi''), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of  "man of the world", "mundane or secular person".
Also from the 17th century, ''Weltgeist'' acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of "world-spirit" or "world-soul" (''anima mundi, spiritus universi'') in the sense of [[Panentheism]], a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction  between [[magnetic force|magnet and iron]] or between [[Gravity|Moon and tide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GW16923#XGW16923 Weltgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of ''Weltgeist'' in the sense of ''anima mundi'' became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, ''der Geist'' on its own could refer to this concept, as in [[Christian Thomasius]], ''Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes'' (1709).&lt;ref&gt; Rudolf Eisler''Wörterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe'' (1904),  406ff., 1760f.&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in a ''Weltgeist'' as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of [[Goethe]], in the later part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, ''Geist der Göthezeit'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the  poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the ''Weltgeist'' 
appears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of [[Nature]].
&lt;ref&gt;J. U. von König, ''Gedichte'' (1745) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;
''Weltgeist'' in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of [[God]] and can be attributed agency and will. 
[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], who tended to prefer the form ''Weltengeist'' (as it were "spirit of worlds"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:
:'' O Weltengeist, Bist du so gütig, wie du mächtig bist, Enthülle mir, den du mitfühlend zwar, Und doch so grausam schufst, erkläre mir Das Loos der Fühlenden, die durch mich leiden.''
:"O World-spirit, be as benevolent as you are powerful and reveal to me, whom you have created with compassion and yet cruelly, explain to me the lot of the sentient, who suffer through me"&lt;ref&gt;Herder, "Die Gärten der Hesperiden", ''Ausgewählte Werke'' 1, ed. Kurz (1871), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895)]]
The term was notably embraced by [[Hegel]] and his followers in the early 19th century.
For the 19th century, the term as used by [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Hegel (1807)]] became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing [[world history]]:
:''Im Gange der Geschichte ist das eine wesentliche Moment die Erhaltung eines Volkes [...] das andere Moment aber ist, daß der Bestand eines Volksgeistes, wie er ist, durchbrochen wird, weil er sich ausgeschöpft und ausgearbeitet hat, daß die Weltgeschichte, der Weltgeist fortgeht.''
:"In the course of history one relevant factor is the preservation of a [[Volk|nation]] [...] while the other factor is that the continued existence of a national spirit [''Volksgeist''] is interrupted because it has exhausted and spent itself, so that world history, the world spirit [''Weltgeist''], proceeds."&lt;ref&gt; Hegel, ''Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte''  (ed. 1944), 96f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's description of [[Napoleon]] as "the world-soul on horseback" (''die Weltseele zu Pferde'') became proverbial.
The phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in  a letter written  on 13 October 1806, the day before the [[Battle of Jena]], to his friend   [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt konzentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}
Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', 
Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.&lt;ref&gt;L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''[[Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen]]'', who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes"  (''schlechte Witze'').&lt;ref&gt;''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770],&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Volksgeist''==
{{redirect|National spirit|the racehorse|National Spirit (horse)|the horse race|National Spirit Hurdle}}
{{see|National character|Ethnic essentialism}}
''Volksgeist'' or ''Nationalgeist'' refers to a "spirit" of an individual [[Volk|people (''Volk'')]], its "national spirit" or "national character".
The term ''Nationalgeist'' is used in the 1760s by [[Justus Möser]] and by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The term ''Nation'' at this time is used in the sense of ''[[:wikt:natio#Latin|natio]]'' "nation, ethnic group, race", mostly replaced by the term ''Volk'' after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Mährlein, ''Volksgeist und Recht. Hegels Philosophie der Einheit und ihre Bedeutung in der Rechtswissenschaft'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, Würzburg (2000), 17f.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 19th century, the term ''Volksgeist'' was used by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] in order to express the "popular" sense of [[justice]].
Savigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an ''esprit des nations '' used by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essai sur les mœurs et l’esprit des nations'', 1756.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the ''esprit général'' invoked by  [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vom Geist der Gesetze'', 1748.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel uses the term in his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''.
Based on the Hegelian use of the term, [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in the mid-19th-century established the field of ''Völkerpsychologie'' ("psychology of nations").

In Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. In the history of cultures, [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. In the history of the State or political history, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In the field of law, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and in the field of psychology [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to [[Romanticism]] as it is commonly known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], "… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist."{{huh|date=March 2018}}{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

==''Zeitgeist''==
{{main article|Zeitgeist}}
{{See also|Multiple discovery|Epochalism}}
The compound ''Zeitgeist''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zeitgeist oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times") similarly to ''Weltgeist'' describes 
an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in [[world history]].
The term is now mostly associated with [[Hegel]], contrasting with Hegel's use of ''Volksgeist'' "national spirit" and ''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit", 
but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to  a [[fad|fashion or fad]] which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=StF&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |author=Eero Saarinen |title=Shaping the Future |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-972-48812-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel in ''[[Phenomenology of the Spirit]]'' (1807) uses both ''Weltgeist'' and ''Volksgeist'' but prefers the phrase ''Geist der Zeiten'' "spirit of the times" over the [[German compound|compound]] ''Zeitgeist''.&lt;ref&gt;
c.f. use of the phrase {{lang|de|der Geist seiner Zeit}} ("the spirit of his time") in  ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit." {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Zeitgeist |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-847-06591-9 &lt;!--|ISBN=1-84706591-0 --&gt;|chapter=Zeitgeist (p. 262)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a  "free and ethical culture".{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, John Shannon. ''Aesthetics &amp; The Philosophy Of Spirit''. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used more widely in the  sense of an intellectual or aesthetic [[fashion]] or [[fad]].
For example, [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 proposition that [[evolution]] occurs by [[natural selection]] has been cited as a case of the ''zeitgeist'' of the epoch, an idea "whose time had come", seeing that his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], was outlining similar models during the same period.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"&gt;Hothersall, D., "History of Psychology", 2004, {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of [[logical positivism]] in the 1920s, leading to a focus on [[behaviorism]] and [[blank-slatism]] over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s,  the  shift from behaviorism to [[post-modernism]] and [[critical theory]]  can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic "zeitgeist".&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
''Zeitgeist'' in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his "theory of [[leadership]]"&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and in other publications describing models of business or industry.
[[Malcolm Gladwell]] argued in his book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.

[[File:Coat of arms of Kenya (Official).svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms of Kenya]]]]

==History==
'''''Harambee''''' is a [[Kenya]]n tradition of community self-help events, e.g. [[fundraising]] or development activities. ''Harambee'' literally means "all pull together" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and is also the official [[List of national mottos|motto]] of Kenya and appears on its [[Coat of arms of Kenya|coat of arms]]. 

Harambee events may range from informal affairs lasting a few hours, in which invitations are spread by word of mouth, to formal, multi-day events advertised in newspapers. These events have long been important in parts of [[East Africa]], as ways to build and maintain communities.

Following [[Kenya]]'s independence in 1963, the first Prime Minister, and later first [[President of Kenya]], [[Jomo Kenyatta]] adopted "Harambee" as a concept of pulling the country together to build a new nation. He encouraged communities to work together to raise funds for all sorts of local projects, pledging that the government would provide their startup costs. Under this system, wealthy individuals wishing to get into politics could donate large amounts of money to local harambee drives, thereby gaining legitimacy; however, such practices were never institutionalised during Kenyatta's presidency.

==Etymology==
A [[popular etymology]] deriving the term from the name of a [[Hindu]] goddess, ''Amba Mata'' (a form of [[Durga]] riding a Tiger) has been proposed, supposedly via Hindu railway linesmen carrying  loads of iron rails and sleeper blocks who would chant "har, har Ambe!" ("praise Amba") when working.

The first president, [[Jomo Kenyatta]] has been said to have witnessed such a railway line team as it worked in cohesion and harmony and derived the term from there.  The actual etymology of the term is, however, cited as genuinely Bantu, from the [[Miji Kenda]] term ''halumbe'' "to pull or push together".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jaluo.com/?p=8900 Kenya:&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
The word ''Harambee'' and the concept of ''harambee'' funds-drives have received criticism. The word was originally adopted by [[Jomo Kenyatta]] into the Kenyan philosophy to mean ''pulling together'' or cooperating in community projects. 

===Historical Abuse and Poor Performance===
Due to repeated abuse, the word ''Harambee'' is often perceived to refer to manipulative or deceptive collection of monetary funds from the public. 

''Harambee'' funds drives have been repeatedly abused through:-
*misappropriation of publicly collected ''harambee'' funds by individuals;
*force contributions by government officials;
*forced contributions through forced and unofficial deductions on the salaries of government employees;
*corruption and use of ''harambee'' (funds drives) for personal gains;
*many stalled ''harambee'' projects (schools, hospitals, roads, State owned factories etc);
*poor coordination of ''harambee'' funded projects;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives as campaign platforms by political aspirants;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives to publicly attack and embarrass political rivals;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives to launder money stolen by officers who attempt to clean their public image by appearing to give generous donations for public projects;
*use of ''harambee'' events to give bribes under the guise of issuing public donations;
*poor performance of State controlled entities that have the word ''Harambee'' as part of their name e.g., the national football team [[Kenya_national_football_team|''Harambee Stars'']];
*perceived inferior status and poor management history of ''Harambee'' schools which were established through ''Harambee'' fund-raising projects; and
*perceived legitimisation of dependency on donations or external assistance at the expense of promoting self-sufficiency, resourcefulness and innovation.

===Religious Criticism===
Kenyan Christians have criticised the use of the word ''Harambee'' as an official term due to its apparent hindu origin. ''Harambee'' is neither a Hindu god nor a hindu word; it is a Swahili word and Kenyan. The objections have also been dismissed on the basis that even if the supposed derivation from ''Hare Ambeh'' (Hail Ambeh) were true, it has become irrelevant to the term's modern usage and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/kenyan-national-motto-controversial-to-some/3084.html "Kenyan National Motto Controversial to Some"], ''Hindu Press International,'' July 5, 2003 [http://allafrica.com/stories/200805051353.html "Kenya: What's in a Name? Goddesses Have Always Been Worshipped"], ''The Nation,'' May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted Replacement===
In January 2002, the Risk Advisory Group Ltd commissioned by [[Daniel_arap_Moi|President Moi's]] administration as part of the anti-corruption efforts recommended the abolition of ''harambee'' or the ''spirit of pulling together''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000092053/efforts-to-end-corruption-in-harambees "Efforts to end corruption in harambees"], ''The Standard'', August 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2003 when the [[National_Rainbow_Coalition|National Rainbow Coalition NARC]] took over from the [[Kenya_African_National_Union|Kenya African National Union KANU]], President [[Mwai Kibaki]] enacted the Public Officers Ethics Act which prohibited Members of Parliament and Cabinet Secretaries from presiding over ''Harambees''.

In February 2018, a petition was presented to the Kenyan Parliament, [[Senate_of_Kenya|Senate]], seeking to have the word ''HARAMBEE'' removed from the Public Seal on the claim that it represents a Hindu Goddess &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001269763/petition-over-word-harambee-splits-senators "Petition over word ‘harambee’ splits senators"], ''The Standard'', February 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''history and philosophy of science''' ('''HPS''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that encompasses the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[History of science and technology|history of science]]. Although many scholars in the field are trained primarily as either historians or as philosophers, there are degree-granting departments of HPS at several prominent universities (see below).

==A unified discipline==
The organization [http://integratedhps.org/en/ &amp;HPS] (Integrated History and Philosophy of Science) has set forth a program for a unified discipline: "Good history and philosophy of science is not just history of science into which some philosophy of science may enter, or philosophy of science into which some history of science may enter. It is work that is both historical and philosophical at the same time. The founding insight of the modern discipline of HPS is that history and philosophy have a special affinity and one can effectively advance both simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;"About &amp;HPS," http://www3.nd.edu/~andhps/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One origin of the unified discipline is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach is reflected in the career of [[Thomas Kuhn]]. His first permanent appointment, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn" in ''The Road Since Structure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because "I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students".&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn," p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal [[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, theory change are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as [[paradigm shift]].

However, Kuhn was also critical of attempts fully to unify the ''methods'' of history and philosophy of science: "Subversion is not, I think, too strong a term for the likely result of an attempt to make the two fields into one. They differ in a number of their central constitutive characteristics, of which the most general and apparent is their goals. The final product of most historical research is a narrative, a story, about particulars of the past. [...] The philosopher, on the other hand, aims principally at explicit generalizations and at those with universal scope. He is no teller of stories, true or false. His goal is to discover and state what is true at all times and places rather than to impart understanding of what occurred at a particular time and place."&lt;ref&gt;"The Relations Between the History and the Philosophy of Science," pp. 3–20 in ''The Essential Tension'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent work questions whether these methodological and conceptual divisions are in fact barriers to a unified discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Patton, ''Philosophy, Science, and History'', pp. 27–33, New York: Routledge 2014, http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415898317/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holophrastic indeterminacy''', or '''indeterminacy of sentence translation''', is one of two kinds of [[indeterminacy of translation]] to appear in the writings of philosopher [[Willard Quine|W. V. O. Quine]].&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt; According to Quine, "there is more than one correct method of translating sentences where the two translations differ not merely in the meanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also in the net import of the whole sentence".&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hylton/&gt; It is holophrastic indeterminacy that underlies Quine's argument against synonymy, the basis of his objections to [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s [[Analytic/synthetic distinction#Quine.27s criticisms and responses|analytic/synthetic distinction]].&lt;ref name=Hylton2/&gt; The other kind of indeterminacy introduced by Quine is the "[[inscrutability of reference]]", which refers to parts of a sentence or individual words.

==Indeterminacy of translation==
{{main|Indeterminacy of translation|Radical translation}}
Quine's work on indeterminacy of translation, stemming from the basic forms of indeterminacy,&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt; is widely discussed in modern analytic philosophy:

{{quote|W. V. O. Quine's contention that translation is indeterminate has been among the most widely discussed and controversial theses in modern analytical philosophy. It is a standard-bearer for one of the late twentieth century's most characteristic philosophical preoccupations: the skepticism about semantic notions which is also developed in [[Saul Kripke|Kripke's]] interpretation of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] on rules... and which many have read into [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam's]] 'model-theoretic' assault on realism...[Cross references to chapters 15 and 17 omitted]&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;|Crispin Wright|The indeterminacy of translation }}

Quine's approach to translation, [[radical translation]], takes the perspective of trying to establish the meaning of sentences in a foreign language (Quine calls it ''Arunta'') by observing and questioning native speakers of that language.&lt;ref name=Malpas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackman/&gt;  It is a hypothetical version of what could be an empirical investigation. By an armchair analysis of such an adventure, Quine argues that it is impossible to construct a unique translation that can be defended as better than all others. The reason is predicated upon an argued ''unavoidable'' introduction of the two indeterminacies above. According to [[Hilary Putnam]], it is “what may well be the most fascinating and the most discussed philosophical argument since Kant’s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories”.&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;

==Naturalized epistemology==
{{Main|Naturalized epistemology}}
Holophrastic indeterminacy is important to the understanding of Quine's naturalized epistemology. As Quine states his thesis:
{{quote|"If the English sentences of a theory have their meaning only together as a body, then we can justify their translation into ''Arunta'' [a hypothetical foreign language] only together as a body...Any translations of the English sentences into ''Arunta'' sentences will be as correct as any other, so long as the net empirical implications of the theory as a whole are preserved in translation. But it is to be expected that many different ways of translating the component sentences, essentially different individually, would deliver the same empirical implications for the theory as a whole; deviations in the translation of one component sentence could be compensated for in the translation of another component sentence. Insofar, there can be no ground for saying which of two glaringly unlike translations of individual sentences is right."&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt;|Willard V. O. Quine|Epistemology naturalized, p. 80}}

Quine's naturalized epistemology in brief is the view that instead of traditional attempts to connect how our beliefs relate to evidence, epistemology should focus upon how experience leads to beliefs: the causal connections between our sensory evidence and our beliefs about the world. .&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bayer/&gt;

'''Hume's fork''' is an explanation, developed by later [[philosopher]]s, of [[David Hume]]'s 1730s division of "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence".&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;[[Antony Flew]], ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork p 156].&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between [[Modal logic|necessary]] versus [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] (concerning reality), {{nowrap|''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''}} versus {{nowrap|''[[a posteriori]]''}} (concerning knowledge), and [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] versus [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">'''Idealization''' is the process by which [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an "ideal case," then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.

If an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for [[air resistance]] when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.

Idealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of [[Stokes' law]] allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.

==Early use==
[[Galileo]] utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of [[free fall]]. [[Galileo]], in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.

The most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. [[Galileo]] predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires [[friction]]). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.

==Other examples==
===Mathematics===
[[Geometry]] involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect [[circles]], [[spheres]], straight [[line (geometry)|lines]] and [[angle]]s are [[abstraction]]s that help us think about and investigate the world.

===Science===
An example of the use of idealization in [[physics]] is in [[Boyle's law|Boyle’s Gas Law]]:
''Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.''

In [[physics]], people will often solve for [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] systems without [[friction]]. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the [[force (physics)|force]] of friction is negligible.

===Social science===
It has been argued by the "Poznań School" (in Poland) that [[Karl Marx]] utilized idealization in the [[social sciences]] (see the works written by [[Leszek Nowak]]).&lt;ref&gt;About the Poznań School, see F. Coniglione, ''Realtà ed astrazione. Scuola polacca ed epistemologia post-positivista'', Catania:CUECM 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Model (economics)|economic models]] individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hamminga, N.B. De Marchi (Eds.), ''Idealization VI: Idealization in Economics'', Poznań Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities, Vol. 38, Rodopi:Atlanta-Amsterdam 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.

In [[psychology]], [[idealization]] refers to a [[defence mechanism]] in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in [[child custody]] conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine ("idealize") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.

==Limits on use==
While idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others.&lt;ref name=LIU2004&gt;{{Citation |title=Laws and Models in a Theory of Idealization | author=Chuang Liu | journal=Synthese | year=2004 | volume=138 | issue=3 | pages=363–385 | doi= 10.1023/b:synt.0000016425.36070.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Edmund Husserl]] recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Klawiter A (2004). [http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~klawiter/Husserl&amp;Idealization-PS-82.pdf ''Why did Husserl not become the Galileo of the Science of Consciousness?''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern [[science]], it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=LIU2004/&gt; For example, [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright N (1994) [http://141.105.33.55/~lomov/library/bigdvd/dvd54/Cartwright%20N.%20-%20Nature's%20Capacities%20and%20Their%20Measurement(194).pdf ''Nature's capacities and their measurement.''] pp. 186–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the [[ideal gas law]]) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20528">{{about|the approach developed by Roy Harris|the approach based on Hans-Heinrich Lieb's work|Integrational linguistics}}
'''Integrationism''' (also known as '''integrational linguistics''') is an approach in the [[theory of communication]] that emphasizes innovative participation by communicators within contexts and rejects rule-based models of language. It was developed by a group of [[linguists]] at the [[University of Oxford]] during the 1980s, notably [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]].

The International Association for the Integrational Study of Language and Communication was founded in 1998 and has members in more than twenty-five countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrationists.com IAISLC].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and language==
While the integrationist views of [[Roy Harris|Harris]] and Dr Adrian Pablé, among others, differ from those who believe that cognition is [[Distributed cognition|distributed]] (i.e.  Kravchenko and Love), the view on language between the two fields are quite similar.  Both sides criticize the traditional view of linguistics which holds language as an individual internal psychological concern that takes written language as the base from which to begin analysis. Instead, integrationists view knowledge (which includes language) as “(i) linked to an individual’s experience, and therefore dependent on the ‘evidence available’ to that particular individual, but at the same time (ii) unpredictable because any integrational task involving sign-making and sign-interpreting is carried out in actual, time-embedded situations, which are not simply ‘given’, either.”.&lt;ref name=pable2010&gt;Pablé, 2010.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, language usage is intrinsically, and without fail, contextual in all of its uses.  Furthermore, Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe&lt;ref name=phc2010&gt;Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; question whether language is even amenable to scientific description, based upon its contextual nature.
The contextual nature of language leads to a rejection of the notion that language is a ‘fixed code’.  Harris discusses this extensively:

:"When we come across words we do not know, words which apparently did not exist a few years ago, it is difficult to resist two conclusions. One is that if there are verbal ‘codes’, they cannot be fixed: on the contrary, they must be changing all the time. The other conclusion is that if there are such codes, different people use different ones, and these too change. Until yesterday, mine did not include the word moshpit: today it does. But if the code has the kind of instability evidenced by the sudden emergence of new words and meanings, what guarantee of stability is there for ‘old’ words and meanings? The integrationist sees none. And if indeed there is none, then it is the viability of the concept of the code that is itself called in question. For it conspicuously fails to fulfill the theoretical function that is required of a code in semantics; namely to provide a source for those publicly invariant meanings that supposedly underpin verbal communication in the community, and can consequently be both ‘encoded’ and ‘decoded’ by those who know the code.”&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of parts of a fixed code, language is looked at as a resource to conduct action with, an idea that echoes the notions put forth by [[Speech act theory|speech act]] theorists such as [[J.L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Interactional sociolinguistics|interactional sociolinguists]] such as [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]], [[Conversation Analysis|conversation analysts]] such as [[Harvey Sacks|Sacks]], [[Schegloff]], and Goodwin, as well as others such as [[Goffman]], all of whom were or are active in fields outside of linguistics, including language philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Harris claims that to not know what a word means is to not know what to do with the words, to not know “how to integrate the occurrence of the word into enough of our linguistic experience to satisfy the requirement of the [present] case”.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998 (cited by Pablé, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
Pablé explores the integrationist views of language in terms of the naming practices related to castles in [[Bellinzona, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=pable2009&gt;Pablé, 2009.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By asking locals the directions to castles using non-standard names for the castles, Pablé elicited various forms by which the locals referred to them, highlighting the idea that references to the places were “highly context sensitive” and that the “meaning” is created on the spot,&lt;ref name=pable2009/&gt; and that “speakers always make sense of language in light of their own experience”.&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;

According to integrationist principles, the separation of linguistic phenomena into distinct parts of study is a fundamental error in the conceptualization of language. In 'The Language Myth', Harris postulates that the isolation and subsequent segregational approach of orthodox linguistics is a result of the fact of language itself being the descriptive medium for its own study. A problem arises when we consider words as stand-ins for things. When we then have a word for a language, the word misleads us to consider languages to be things out there in the world rather than real time, second order processes undergoing constant adjustment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Epistemological overlaps==
Integrationism overlaps with recent and not so recent epistemologies concerning communication and interaction. It retains an interest in understanding the system of language-making as an emergent, context-bound, and fundamentally human activity. This view is philosophically consistent with sociocultural theories such as activity theory where the historicity of human experience is recognized to have implications on our activities in ways that shape how they unfold.&lt;ref&gt;Cole &amp; Hatano, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrationist linguistics overlaps with pragmatic and phenomenological approaches such as ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. The latter being rightly susceptible to a written and spoken word bias yet this is not without current attempts to broaden and include a wider range of semiotic contingencies into analyses. The more fundamental overlap is epistemological. Harold Garfinkel's (1994) ethnomethodological policies prioritize the context of interaction with strict objection to analytic presupposed systems of any kind other than that which is made so by the sequentially ordered interactions of participants. Conversation analysts have developed an empirical approach stemming from those policies where spoken and written words are centralized. A recent decentralizing move to the analysis and theorization of multimodal sequential analysis is very much consistent with an integrationist point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streeck, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and identity==
While integrationism has been in existence for over three decades, advocating against the “language myth”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Harris, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicating that linguistic sign alone cannot function as the basis of an independent, self-sufficient form of communication, but depends for effectiveness on its integration with non-verbal activities of many different kinds, some integrationists have recently directed this perspective to revisit another important concept in sociolinguistics – “social identity”.

This integrational view of identity concurs with the sociocultural perspective that identity is not a rigid and static system predetermined on the basis of either social class, gender, ethnicity, age or education, but rather a discursive and constantly emerging experience that is locally shared and situationally evoked. On the other hand, however, stressing that identity cannot be examined exclusively from an individual’s integrational practice (including both linguistic and non-linguistic practice), integrationists cast doubt on the way sociocultural approach analyzes identity by specifically questioning three of the latter’s tenets: (i) data, (ii) phenomenological inductivism,&lt;ref&gt;Allan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) indirect indexicality.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; They point out an intrinsic controversy that while identity, as the speaker’s first-order experience, is highly context-dependent, the attempt to detect identity merely through inspecting the linguistic components in the tape-recorded data and interpret the data through postulating the existence of linguistically pre-labeled “concrete universals” (e.g. ‘varieties of language’, ‘style’) is actually de-contextualizing the speakers’ identity. Also, they identified another conflict in the sociocultural approach of interpreting a speaker’s identity between the claim of a socially indexical value of linguistic features (“social marker”) that is beyond a single occurrence and the one of locally indexical value of linguistic features that is analyzable only in term of one specific local context.

Compared with sociolinguistic perspective on social identity, integrationists emphasize the integrational phenomenon that occurs when we converse with each other. Sociolinguists concentrate on how people utilize linguistic structures and items, cultural norms, and macro identities that they are normatively assigned in conversation. Based on utterances, sociolinguists attempt to capture speakers’ positionality and relationality in terms of identity, emergence of identity, and indexicality of the language that speakers used.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is problematic to integrationists that sociolinguists only focus upon what is said. In other words, sociolinguists take language as an independent structure that can be isolated from the ongoing conversation. Integrationists argue that utterances cannot be dissociated from the context where he utters statements. Utterances have to be integrated with the activities, linguistic and non-linguistic, at that moment.

In conclusion, from an integrational view, “social identity” is rather a “meta-discursive label used by lay speakers to cope with their everyday first-order experience”&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; than a term or object of scientific study that is static and communicationally predetermined. In other words, along with their refusal of language as a static code system to be decoded for meaning transmission, they specifically emphasize that identity is not amenable to scientific description, as “sign-making and sign-interpreting are ‘private’ and cannot be detached from an individual’s integrational activities in the here-and-now”.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; The remaining question for integrationists is how to study ‘identity’ then. One suggestion integrationalists may be more up to is to treat what is displayed in the temporal situations as “beings” and “becomings” rather than fixed identities, and study it multimodally, which is to take different modalities and time scales into consideration, instead of merely relying on the pre-labelled linguistic features.

==The implications of first-order and second-order language on reading comprehension==
According to the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104016/http://www.unescobkk.org/resources/online-materials/aims/uis-aims-activities/uis-aims-and-literacy-assessment/ What is Literacy?] (archive), UNESCO Office in Bangkok: UIS-AIMS and Literacy Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; literacy is defined as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. In other words, the ability to read and write does not only to fulfill one’s own need but also to communicate with the community and society where one stays. With regard to it, this section first focuses on the distinction between spoken language (first-order language) and written language (second-order language)&lt;ref name=krav&gt;Kravchenko, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and how reading comprehension is achieved, and then aims at the impact of technology-enhanced interaction on reading comprehension.

Traditionally, spoken language and written language are regarded as the two sides of the same coin&lt;ref name=krav/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, written language is believed to fully represent its corresponding spoken language. Therefore, educators believe by teaching words, or the symbolization of phonetic signs, students are equipped with the literacy to understand the written texts. However, it is often the case that students have a hard time understanding and interpreting a poem even though they know every single word. The glittering example reveals the problem of treating spoken language and written language as the same and implies the need to treat them differently.

According to Kravchenko, spoken language and written language are different in that spoken language is temporal and local, while written language is atemporal and non-local.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; The understanding of spoken language relies on the common knowledge shared by the participants who are involved in the conversation, and the cognition required is situated and highly interactional. As for written language, the understanding takes place when the text is written (product) rather than is being written (process). Therefore, it is less interactional. Despite the difference, the understanding of both linguistic systems calls for the appropriate background knowledge. An example adapted from Kravchenko is that if a traveler wants to check in and the clerk tells him/her, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, the traveler may check the watch and calculate when to come back for the check-in, so he/she does not have to stand at the front desk for 20 minutes. However, if the traveler sees a note on the front desk saying, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, he/she may be baffled due to no point of reference, so he/she does not know how long is needed.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; This example shows that it takes more efforts to establish background knowledge for the understanding of written language than spoken language. By extension, successful reading comprehension depends upon the establishment of shared knowledge between writers and readers.

With the development of technologies, written language includes not only printed work but also hypertexts. Because of the new genres of written language, new literacy is needed. Kravchenko maintained that literacy is the knowledge of using knowledge, so students have to develop the ability of reasoning and judgment based on the written texts.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; Jenkins et al. go further by claiming that the form of reasoning plays a more important role than the content of learning in the era of technology-enhanced interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins et al., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; To put it another way, the content can be easily stored and retrieved by means of technologies, so the practice of reasoning centers on how to generate, evaluate, interpret, and deploy the electronic resources. Different electronic resources can provide different affordances, so one of the aims of teaching new literacy is to help students develop the ability of knowing what functions that the certain electronic resource is good at. For instance, the text mediation through computers can facilitate the thinking, reflecting, and revising of one’s own thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wertsh &amp; Biven, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Videos, with the visual and auditory modality, can better help knowledge acquisition than pictures, which have the visual modality alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypertexts available online enable readers to create their own reading paths and recontextualize the resources of websites.&lt;ref name=bt2010&gt;Baldry and Thibault, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the recontextualization, the thematic regions and semiotic formations are more idiosyncratic than fixed. The readers play a role in picking up the meaning through the created reading paths. According to Harris, linguistic signs should be understood with non-verbal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reading the hypertexts, the readers have access to other non-textual resources online, such as pictures, diagrams, videos, etc. The use of those non-verbal semiotic resources within the texts has its function and offers affordances to the readers to make meaning.&lt;ref name=bt2010/&gt;

An '''interpretation''' is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].

The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their [[modal logic|modal]] analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate ''T'' (for "tall") and assign it the extension {''a''} (for "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant ''T'', and does not make a claim about whether ''T'' is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though ''we'' may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.

An interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the [[truth value]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], the interpretation is called a [[model (model theory)|model]] of that sentence or theory.

== Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}

A formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of ''sentences'' (variously  called ''words'' or ''[[well formed formula|formulas]]'') built from a fixed set of ''letters'' or ''symbols''. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called ''[[Well-formed_formula|well-formed formulæ]]'' (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (''P'' or ''Q'') is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.

=== Example ===
A formal language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined with the
alphabet &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \{ \triangle, \square \}&lt;/math&gt;, and with a word being in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; if it begins with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and is composed solely of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

A possible interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; could assign the decimal digit '1' to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and '0' to &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle \square \triangle&lt;/math&gt; would denote 101 under this interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical constants ===
In the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols ([[logical constant]]s) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that ''logical'' symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while ''non-logical'' symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.

Logical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ ("all") and ∃ ("some"), symbols for [[logical connective]]s ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), ¬ ("not"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.

== General properties of truth-functional interpretations ==
Many of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called ''truth functional'';{{dubious|reason=The article 'Truth-functional' gives a more restricted definition: the truth-value of a compound sentence should be a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.|date=September 2015}} they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be ''[[satisfiable|satisfied]]'' by that assignment.

No sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation,{{dubious|reason=Except for paraconsistent logic.|date=September 2015}} but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is ''inconsistent''. A sentence φ is said to be ''logically valid'' if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a ''[[logical consequence]]'' of ψ).

=== Logical connectives ===
Some of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are [[logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] that represent truth functions&amp;nbsp;— functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).

The truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be [[logical constant]]s, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.

This is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:
*¬Φ is True [[iff]] Φ is False.
*(Φ ∧ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True and Ψ is True.
*(Φ ∨ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ → Ψ) is True iff ¬Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ ↔ Ψ) is True iff (Φ → Ψ) is True and (Ψ → Φ) is True.

So under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;"
|+ Logical connectives
!  Interpretation !! Φ !! Ψ !! ¬Φ !! (Φ ∧ Ψ) !! (Φ ∨ Ψ) !! (Φ → Ψ) !! (Φ ↔ Ψ)
|-
|#1|| T || T || F || T || T || T || T
|-
|#2|| T || F || F || F || T || F || F
|-
|#3|| F || T || T || F || T || T || F
|-
|#4|| F || F || T || F || F || T || T
|}

Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula ''F'': (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of ''F'' is True under that interpretation, ''F'' is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make ''F'' True again, since one of ''F''s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for ''F'' are the only possible logical interpretations, and since ''F'' comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.

== Interpretation of a theory ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

An ''interpretation of a theory'' is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a [[many-to-one]] correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a ''full interpretation'', otherwise it is called a ''partial interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Haskell Curry]] |title=Foundations of Mathematical Logic |publisher=Mcgraw Hill |date=1963}} Here: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations for propositional logic ==
The formal language for [[propositional logic]] consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only [[non-logical symbol]]s in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.

The standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the [[truth value]]s true and false. This function is known as a ''truth assignment'' or ''valuation'' function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign [[truthbearer]]s instead.

For a language with ''n'' distinct propositional variables there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable ''a'', for example, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2 possible interpretations: 1) ''a'' is assigned '''T''', or 2) ''a'' is assigned '''F'''. For the pair ''a'', ''b'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned '''T''', 2) both are assigned '''F''', 3) ''a'' is assigned '''T''' and ''b'' is assigned '''F''', or 4) ''a'' is assigned '''F''' and ''b'' is assigned '''T'''.

Given any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.

== First-order logic ==
Unlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]].  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number [[arity]] is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.

For example, in the language of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)

Again, we might define a first-order language '''L''', as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.

=== Formal languages for first-order logic ===
Given a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol "=" for equality (see the section "[[#Interpreting equality|Interpreting equality"]] below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.

=== Interpretations of a first-order language ===
To ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.
* A [[domain of discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the "universe of disourse"&lt;/ref&gt; ''D'', usually required to be non-empty (see below).
* For every constant symbol, an element of ''D'' as its interpretation.
* For every ''n''-ary function symbol, an ''n''-ary function from ''D'' to ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a function ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'').
* For every ''n''-ary predicate symbol, an ''n''-ary relation on ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a subset of ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
An object carrying this information is known as a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ({{not a typo|of}} signature σ), or σ-structure, or ''L''-structure, or as a "model".

The information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its [[free variable]]s, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the [[T-schema]], which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, {{nowrap|φ &amp; ψ}} is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.

This leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}}. The domain of discourse forms the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(''x''), where ''x'' is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is satisfied if there is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that φ(''d'') is satisfied.

Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.

Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property&lt;ref&gt;The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties "yellow" and "prime" are unary relations.&lt;/ref&gt;(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]]&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Intensional definition|intensional]].

=== Example of a first-order interpretation ===
An example of interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the language '''L''' described above is as follows.
* Domain: A chess set
* Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn
* F(x): x is a piece
* G(x): x is a pawn
* H(x): x is black
* I(x): x is white
* J(x, y): x can capture y

In the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of L:
* the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),
* the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).

=== Non-empty domain requirement === &lt;!--Please preserve this section heading; it is being used in another article --&gt;
As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as
::&lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]&lt;/math&gt;
fails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains |mr=0057820 | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2267402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W. V. | title=Quantification and the empty domain |mr=0064715 | year=1954 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=19 | pages=177–179 | doi=10.2307/2268615 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2268615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.

=== Interpreting equality ===
The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.

The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.

The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a ''normal model'', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called ''first order logic with equality'', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.

There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.

=== Many-sorted first-order logic ===
A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one ''sort'' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.

One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''.

== Higher-order predicate logics ==
A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.

There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. ''Full semantics'' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. ''Henkin semantics'', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.

== Non-classical interpretations ==
The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic.

Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean-valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s.  [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models.

== Intended interpretations ==
Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.

The intended interpretation is called the ''standard model'' (a term introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthonie Meijers|title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51667-1|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=9|author=Roland Müller|chapter=The Notion of a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.

While the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal [[deductive system|syntactical rules]], it naturally affects the choice of the [[formal grammar|formation]] and [[transformation rules]] of the syntactical system. For example, [[primitive notion|primitive signs]] must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; [[sentential formula]]s are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] [[declarative sentence]]s; [[axiom|primitive sentences]] need to come out as [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in the interpretation; [[rules of inference]] must be such that, if the sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; is directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from a sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i \to \mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a true sentence, with {{imp}} meaning [[material conditional|implication]], as usual. These requirements ensure that all [[formal proof|provable]] sentences also come out to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Carnap]] |title=Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications |publisher=Dover publications| location=New York |date=1958 |isbn=9780486604534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of [[non-standard model]]s is an example). When we speak about 'models' in [[empirical science]]s, we mean, if we want [[reality]] to be a model of our science, to speak about an ''intended model''. A model in the empirical sciences is an ''intended factually-true descriptive interpretation'' (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same [[domain of discourse]] as the intended one, but other [[value assignment|assignments]] for [[non-logical constant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hans Freudenthal |title=The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences (Colloquium proceedings)|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-94-010-3669-6 |date=Jan 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|reason=Every chapter is written by a different author.|date=September 2015}}

=== Example ===

Given a simple formal system (we shall call this one &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ \blacksquare, \bigstar, \blacklozenge \}&lt;/math&gt; and whose formation rule for formulas is:
: 'Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;. Nothing else is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;.'

The single [[axiom schema]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ast \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ast&lt;/math&gt; " (where " &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; " is a [[metasyntactic variable]] standing for a finite string of " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; "s )

A formal proof can be constructed as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

In this example the theorem produced " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; " can be interpreted as meaning "One plus three equals four." A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]] |title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic| publisher=University of California Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

== Other concepts of interpretation ==
There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.

In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''.  For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]].

A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''′ of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''′.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9789">'''Islamic bioethics''', or Islamic [[medical ethics]], ({{lang-ar|الأخلاق الطبية}} ''al-akhlaq al-tibbiyyah'') refers to Islamic guidance on [[ethics|ethical]] or [[morality|moral]] issues relating to medical and scientific fields, in particular, those dealing with human life.&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction ==
In Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from [[Allah|God]], and should therefore be both respected and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in many [[Qur’an]]ic verses or ''[[ayat]]'', one of the most important being:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind."(Qur’an 5:32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:
# Saving a life is obligatory.
# Unjustified taking of a life is classified as [[murder]] and, thus, forbidden.

Though [[Muslim]]s recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them [[reason]], [[free will]], the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13).&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"/&gt; With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources==
The fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law ([[shari’a]]) and [[Islamic ethics]]. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or [[fatwa]]s regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as [[bid‘ah]] (innovation) and, therefore, is [[haram]] (impermissible).&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, 

* Qur’an,
* [[Hadith]] or [[Sunnah]]
* [[Ijtihad]]
** In [[Sunni]] Islam, ijtihad includes [[qiyas]] (analogy), [[ijma]] (consensus), [[maslaha]] (public welfare) and ‘[[urf]] (customary practice)
** In [[Shi’a]] Islam it is composed solely of al-[['aql]] (reason)

==Principles==
Principles of [[bioethics]] in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James F. Childress]], in their book, ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These bioethical principles: [[autonomy]], [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], [[non-maleficence]] and [[justice]] have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the ''Oath of the Muslim Doctor'' [http://www.islamset.com/ethics/code/oath.html] and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hathery, Shabib. "The Muslim Doctor: Duties and Responsibilities." ''Islamic Medical Association Conference, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.'' Ed. Khan, Y. and H. Bouagada. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority ==
Formulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority ([[mufti]]) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory ([[wajib]]/[[fard]]), recommended ([[mustahabb]]), neutral ([[mubah]]), discouraged ([[makruh]]) or forbidden ([[haram]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
As health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many [[Islamic countries]] which work together with [[ulema]] to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of [[bioethics]] is jeopardized.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include [[abortion]], [[fertility treatment]]s, [[family planning]], [[euthanasia]], [[genetic research]], [[cloning]], [[stem cell research]] among many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics Project==
The [http://engage.bioethics.georgetown.edu/imse Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project] is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/collections/islamic/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Project staff members at two [[Georgetown University]] libraries, the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics|Bioethics Research Library]] (Washington) and the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar#Library|School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library]] (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF), a member of the [[Qatar Foundation|Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnrf.org/nl/research_news/index.php?ELEMEID=1646&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Juche''''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|ˈ|tʃ|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_pronounce_JUCHE|title=How do you pronounce JUCHE|website=Answers.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ko|주체/主體|lit=[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]}}; {{IPA-ko|tɕutɕʰe}}; usually left untranslated{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=14}} or translated as "[[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]") is the official [[state ideology]] of [[North Korea]], described by the government as "[[Kim Il-sung]]'s original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought".&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul French|date=2014|title=North Korea: State of Paranoia|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-78032-947-5}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It postulates that "man is the master of his destiny",&lt;ref name="Juche Idea: Answers to Hundred Questions"&gt;{{cite book|date=2014|title=Juche Idea: Answers to Hundred Questions|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Korean masses are to act as the "masters of the revolution and construction" and that by becoming self-reliant and strong a nation can achieve true [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="Juche Idea: Answers to Hundred Questions"/&gt;

[[Kim Il-sung]] (1912–1994) developed the ideology, originally viewed as a variant of [[Marxism–Leninism]] until it became distinctly Korean in character&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; whilst incorporating the [[historical materialist]] ideas of Marxism–Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual, the nation state and its [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; Consequently, the [[North Korean government]] adopted ''Juche'' into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards. Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed ''jaju'' ("independence"),&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt; through the construction of ''jarip'' ("national economy") and an emphasis upon ''jawi'' ("self-defence") in order to establish [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt;

The practice of ''Juche'' is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency. The ''Juche'' ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule of the North Korean regime&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"&gt;{{cite book|author= Victor Cha|date= 2009|title= The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future|publisher= Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} and justifying the country's heavy-handed [[isolationism]] and oppression of the North Korean people.&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"/&gt; It has also been described as a form of [[Korean ethnic nationalism]], but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the "Korean race" and acts as a foundation of the subsequent [[North Korean cult of personality|personality cult surrounding them]].&lt;ref name="North Korea: State of Paranoia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Impossible State: North Korea Past and Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2012|title=Kim Jong Il: The Great Man|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Juche'' comes from a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]] {{lang|ja|主體}} whose [[Japanese language|Japanese]] reading is ''shutai''. The word was coined in 1887 to translate the concept of ''{{lang|de|Subjekt}}'' in [[German philosophy]] ([[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], meaning "the entity perceiving or acting upon an object or environment") into Japanese. The word migrated to the [[Korean language]] at around the turn of the century and retained this meaning.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=11}} ''Shutai'' went on to appear in Japanese translations of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=12}} North Korean editions of Marx used the word ''Juche'' even before the word was attributed to [[Kim Il-sung]] in its supposedly novel meaning in 1955.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=13}}

In today's political discourse on [[North Korea]], ''Juche'' has a connotation of "self-reliance", "autonomy" and "independence".{{sfn|Cumings|1997|pp=207, 403–04}}{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=73–74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey|last=Robinson|first=Michael E|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3174-5|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often defined in opposition to the Korean concept of ''[[Sadae]]'', or reliance on the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea since 1850|last1=Lone|first1=Stewart|last2=McCormack|first2=Gavan|authorlink2=Gavan McCormack|publisher=Longman Cheshire|location=Melbourne|year=1993|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]ns use the word without reference to the North Korean ideology.{{sfn|Myers|2015|pp=13–14}}

== History ==
=== Origin ===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|Variants}}
Official statements by the [[North Korean government]] attribute the origin of ''Juche'' to Kim Il-sung's experiences in the Anti-Imperialist Youth League in 1930 in his "liberation struggle" against Japan.&lt;ref name="Juche Idea: Answers to Hundred Questions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyung-chan Kim and Tong-gyu Kim. ''Human Remolding in North Korea: A Social History of Education''. Lanham, MD: University Press of America. 2005. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented reference to ''Juche'' as an ideology appeared in 1955 in a speech given by Kim Il-sung entitled "On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing ''Juche'' in Ideological Work". The speech had been delivered to promote a political [[purge]] similar to the earlier [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=13|author=高麗大學校亞細亞問題硏究所|year=1970|page=63|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hwang Jang-yop]], Kim's top adviser on ideology, discovered Kim's 1955 speech in the late 1950s when Kim, having established a [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|cult of personality]],&lt;ref name="Sources"&gt;Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds. ''Sources of Korean Tradition'', Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press, p. 419, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to develop his own version of [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a North Korean ideology.&lt;ref name="Rogue"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rogue Regime: Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea|last=Becker|first=Jasper|authorlink=Jasper Becker|pages=65–66|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-0-19-517044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Paul|title=North Korea: The Paranoid Peninsula – A Modern History|edition=2nd ed. Print.|location=New York|publisher=Zed Books|date=2007|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
{{History of North Korea}}
In his 1955 speech, the first known to refer to ''Juche'', Kim Il-sung said: &lt;blockquote&gt;To make revolution in Korea we must know Korean history and geography as well as the customs of the Korean people. Only then is it possible to educate our people in a way that suits them and to inspire in them an ardent love for their native place and their motherland.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=421–22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the speech "On Socialist Construction and the South Korean Revolution in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" given on 14 April 1965, Kim Il-sung outlined the three fundamental principles of ''Juche'':
# Political independence ({{korean|hangul=자주|rr=jaju|mr=chaju|context=north}})
# Economic self-sustenance ({{korean|hangul=자립|rr=jarip|mr=charip|context=north}})
# Self-reliance in defence ({{korean|hangul=자위|rr=jawi|mr=chawi|context=north}})

''[[On the Juche Idea]]'', the main work on ''Juche'', was published in North Korea in [[Kim Jong-il]]'s name in 1982.{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} In North Korea it functions as "the authoritative and comprehensive explanation of ''Juche''".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} According to the treatise, the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) is responsible for indoctrinating the masses in the ways of ''Juche'' thinking.{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} According to the treatise, ''Juche'' is inexorably linked with Kim Il-sung and it "represents the guiding idea of the Korean Revolution [...] we are confronted with the honorable task of modeling the whole society on the ''Juche'' idea".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} Kim Jong-il states in the work that ''Juche'' is not a creative application of Marxism–Leninism, but rather "a new era in the development of human history"{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=19}} while criticizing the "communists and nationalists" of the 1920s for their elitist posture, claiming that they were "divorced from the masses".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=20}} The WPK's break with basic premises of Marxism–Leninism emerges more clearly in the article "Let Us March Under the Banner of Marxism–Leninism and the ''Juche'' Idea".{{sfn|Kwak|2009|p=20}}

In August 1997, the Central People's Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [[promulgated]] regulations regarding use of the [[North Korean calendar|''Juche'' Era calendar]]. [[Gregorian calendar]] dates are used for years before 1912 while years from 1912 (the year of [[Day of the Sun|Kim Il-sung's birth]]) are described as "''Juche'' years". The Gregorian year {{CURRENTYEAR}}, for example, is "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}" as {{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911={{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}. When used, "''Juche'' years" are often accompanied by the Gregorian equivalent, i.e. "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}" or "''Juche'' {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}})".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9708/news8/25.htm#4 "Rules on use of Juche Era adopted"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313071908/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9708/news8/25.htm|date=13 March 2010}} KCNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International outreach ===
Kim's regime saw Juche principles as applicable around the world, not just in Korea.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=404}} Since 1976 North Korea has organized international seminars on ''Juche''. The International Scientific Seminar on the ''Juche'' Idea took place in [[Antananarivo]] from 28 September to 30 September 1976 under the sponsorship of the [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar]]. Many prominent party and government officials, public figures, representatives of revolutionary and progressive organizations, scientists and journalists from more than fifty countries attended. [[List of Presidents of Madagascar|Malagasy President]] [[Didier Ratsiraka]] expressed strong sympathies and support for North Korea. An excerpt from the opening speech says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Regardless of the opposition forces, the determination of the people and their strength and conviction are not measured by territorial dimensions, possession of advanced technology, still less, opulence or riches. For those who wish to forget the lesson of history so easily and so quickly, Algeria, Viet Nam, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola – and closer to us – Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Azania are excellent examples which make them deeply reflect on. What we want is not the perfection of political independence alone. The evil forces craftily manipulate the economic levers in order to perpetuate their supremacy and reduce us to vassals and eternal mendicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Juche, the Banner of Independence |year= 1977 |publisher= Foreign Languages Publishing House |location= Pyongyang |oclc= 4048345 |page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The International Institute of the ''Juche'' Idea was established{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} in [[Tokyo]] in 1978 to supervise international ''Juche'' research-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hyung Gu Lynn | date = 2007 | title = Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 | publisher = Zed Books | pp= 107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]] in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, incorporated commemorative plaques from supporters and ''Juche'' Study Groups from around the world.{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=73–74}} In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Black Panther Party]] expressed sympathy for the Juche ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Black Panther's Secret North Korean Fetish |url= http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/the-black-panther-north-korean-juche-fetish |website=NKNEWS.ORG |access-date=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510095420/http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/the-black-panther-north-korean-juche-fetish |archivedate= 10 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= "Our Common Struggle Against Our Common Enemy": North Korea and the American Radical Left |url= http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_14_North_Korea_and_the_American_Radical_Left.pdf |website= WilsonCenter.org |publisher= Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |access-date= 26 May 2015 |format= PDF |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306162949/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_14_North_Korea_and_the_American_Radical_Left.pdf |archivedate= 6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nepal Workers and Peasants Party]] identifies ''Juche'' as its guiding idea in its governance of the city of [[Bhaktapur]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
=== Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism&lt;!-- 'Kimilsungism', 'Kimjongilism', and 'Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism' redirecte here. --&gt; ===
'''Kimilsungism'''&lt;!-- Boldface per WP:R#PLA. --&gt; was first mentioned by [[Kim Jong-il]] in the 1970s{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} and was introduced alongside the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System]].{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} Not long after the term's introduction into the North Korean [[wikt:lexicon|lexicon]], Kim Jong-il allegedly launched a "{{sic|Kimilsungism-isation}} of the Whole Society" campaign.{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} These campaigns were introduced so as to strengthen Kim Jong-il's position within the Workers' Party of Korea.{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} According to political analyst Lim Jae-cheon, "''Kimilsungism'' refers to the thoughts of [[Kim Il-sung]]. It is interchangeable with the {{sic|''juche''}} idea".{{sfn|Lim|2012|p=561}} However, in his 1976 speech "On Correctly Understanding the Originality of Kimilsungism" he said that Kimilsungism comprises the "''Juche'' idea and a far-reaching revolutionary theory and leadership method evolved from this idea".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=89}} In the past Kim Il-sung's thoughts had been described by the official media as "contemporary [[Marxism–Leninism]]", but by calling it Kimilsungism Kim Jong-il was trying to elevate it to the same level as [[Maoism]], [[Hoxhaism]] and [[Stalinism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} The younger Kim further argued that Kim Il-sung's thoughts had evolved and they therefore deserved their own distinct name.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} He further added that "Kimilsungism is an original idea that cannot be explained within the frameworks of Marxism–Leninism. The idea of ''Juche'', which constitutes the quintessence of Kimilsungism, is an idea newly discovered in the history of mankind".{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=89–90}} Kim Jong-il went further, stating that Marxism–Leninism had become obsolete and must be replaced by Kimilsungism:{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} {{quote|The revolutionary theory of Kimilsungism is a revolutionary theory which has provided solutions to problems arising in the revolutionary practice in a new age different from the era that gave rise to Marxism–Leninism. On the basis of ''Juche'' (idea), the leader gave a profound explanation of the theories, strategies and tactics of [[national liberation]], class emancipation and human liberations in our era. Thus, it can be said that the revolutionary theory of Kimilsungism is a perfect revolutionary theory of Communism in the era of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}}}}

According to analyst Shin Gi-wook, the ideas of ''Juche'' and Kimilsungism were in essence the "expressions of North Korean particularism over supposedly more universalistic Marxism–Leninism".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} In many ways, it signaled a move from socialism to [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=90}} This was made very clear in a speech in 1982, when North Korea celebrated Kim Il-sung's 70th [[Day of the Sun|birthday]] in which love for the nation came before love for socialism.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=90–91}} This particularism gave birth to such concepts as A Theory of the Korean Nation as Number One and Socialism of Our Style.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}}

Following the [[death of Kim Jong-il]], Kimilsungism was turned into '''Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;  at the 4th Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea.{{sfn|Rüdiger|2013|p=45}} As well as stating that the WPK was "the party of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il", Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism was made "the only guiding idea of the party".{{sfn|Rüdiger|2013|p=45}} In the 4th Conference's aftermath, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) stated that "the Korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the President [Kim Il-sung] and Kim Jong-il as Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation".{{sfn|Alton|Chidley|2013|p=109}} [[Kim Jong-un]], the WPK First Secretary, said that "Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an integral system of the idea, theory and method of ''Juche'' and a great revolutionary ideology representative of the ''Juche'' era. Guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, we should conduct Party building and Party activities, so as to sustain the revolutionary character of our Party and advance the revolution and construction in line with the ideas and intentions of the President and the General."&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;Kim Jong-un, ''Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding the Great Comrade Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party'', 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism of Our Style ===
Socialism of Our Style, also referred to as Korean-style socialism and our-style socialism within North Korea, is an ideological concept Kim Jong-il introduced on 27 December 1990 in the speech "Socialism of Our Country is a Socialism of Our Style as Embodied by the ''Juche'' idea".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} Speaking after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that brought down the [[Eastern Bloc]] regimes, Kim Jong-il explicitly stated that North Korea needed—and survived because of—Socialism of Our Style.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} He argued that socialism in Eastern Europe failed because they "imitated the Soviet experience in a mechanical manner".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} According to Kim, they failed to understand that the Soviet experience was based on specific historical and social circumstances and could not be used by other countries aside from the Soviet Union itself.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} He added that "if experience is considered absolute and accepted dogmatically it is impossible to build Socialism properly, as the times change and the specific situation of each country is different from another".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=91}} Kim Jong-il went on to criticize "dogmatic application" of Marxism–Leninism, stating:{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–92}} {{quote|Marxism–Leninism presented a series of opinions on building of Socialism and Communism, but it confined itself to presupposition and hypothesis owing to the limitations of the conditions of their ages and practical experiences [...] But many countries applied the principles of Marxist–Leninist [[Historical materialism|materialistic conception of history]] dogmatically, failing to advance revolution continually after the establishment of the socialist system.{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–92}}}}

North Korea would not encounter such difficulties because of the conceiving of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} In his words, North Korea was "a backward, colonial semifeudal society" when the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Communists]] took over, but since the North Korean Communists did not accept [[Marxism]] because it was based on European [[capitalist]] experiences, or [[Leninism]], which was based on Russia's experience, they conceived of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Additionally, he believed the situation in North Korea was also more complex because of the American presence in South Korea.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Thanks to Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il argued, the revolution had "put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} "The ''Juche'' idea is a revolutionary theory which occupies the highest stage of development of the revolutionary ideology of the working class", Kim Jong-il said, further stating that the originality and superiority of the ''Juche'' idea defined and strengthened Korean socialism.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} He then conceded by stating that Socialism of Our Style was "a man-centered Socialism", explicitly making a break with basic Marxist–Leninist thought, which argues that material forces are the driving force of historical progress, not people.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92}} Socialism of Our Style was presented as an organic sociopolitical theory, using the language of Marxism–Leninism, saying:{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92–93}} {{quote|The political and ideological might of the motive force of revolution is nothing but the power of single-hearted unity between the leader, the Party, and the masses. In our socialist society, the leader, the Party, and the masses throw in their lot with one another, forming a single socio-political organism. The consolidation of blood relations between the leader, the Party and the masses is guaranteed by the single ideology and united leadership.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=92–93}}}}

=== "Great Leader" theory ===
Unlike Marxism–Leninism, which considers improvements in the material conditions of production and exchange as the driving force of historical progress (known as [[historical materialism]]), ''Juche'' considers human beings in general the driving force in history.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} It is summarized as "the popular masses are placed in the center of everything, and the leader is the center of the masses".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} ''Juche'', North Korea maintains, is a "man-centered ideology" in which the "man is the master of everything and decides everything".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} In contrast to Marxist–Leninist thought in which people's decisions are inextricably linked to their relations to the [[means of production]] (a concept referred to as "[[relations of production]]"), in ''Juche'' thought man is independent and decides everything.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=4}} Just like Marxist–Leninist thought, ''Juche'' believes history is law-governed, but that it is only man who drives progress, stating that "the popular masses are the drivers of history".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=5}} However, for the masses to be successful, they need a "Great Leader".{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=5}} Marxism–Leninism argues that the popular masses will lead (on the basis of their relation to production), but in North Korea the role of a Great Leader should be essential for leadership.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=6}} This theory allegedly helped Kim Il-sung establish a unitary, one-man rule over North Korea.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=6}}

The theory turns the Great Leader into an absolutist, supreme leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The [[working class]] is not to think for themselves, but instead to think through the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The Great Leader is the "top brain" (i.e. "mastermind") of the working class, meaning that he is the only legitimate representative of the working class.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} Class struggle can be realized only through the Great Leader and difficult tasks in general and revolutionary changes in particular can be introduced only through and by the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} In historical development, it is the Great Leader who is the leading force of the working class.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=7}} The Great Leader is also a flawless human being who never commits mistakes, who is always benevolent and who always rules for the masses.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=8}} The leader is incorruptible.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=8}} For the Great Leader system to function, a unitary ideological system must be in place.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=9}} In North Korea, that unitary ideological system is known as the [[Ten Principles for a Monolithic Ideological System]].{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=9}}

=== The "masses" ===
Unlike the [[Joseon dynasty]], where there was a huge gap between the upper and lower classes, North Korea had adopted the concept of a gathered-together "people". Instead of a strict social hierarchy, North Korea had in theory divided the union into three classes, namely peasant, worker and ''samuwon'' (intellectuals and professionals), where each was just as important as the other. The ''samuwon'' class consisted of clerks, small traders, bureaucrats, professors and writers. This was a unique class that was created to increase education and literacy of North Korea's population.

Normally, Communist nations would value only the farmers or laborers, thus in the Soviet Union the [[intelligentsia]] was not defined as an independent class of its own, but rather as a "social stratum" that recruited itself from members of almost all classes: [[proletariat]], [[petite bourgeoisie]] and [[bourgeoisie]]. However, a "peasant intelligentsia" was never mentioned. Correspondingly, the "proletarian intelligentsia" was exalted for bringing forth progressive scientists and Marxist theoreticians whereas the "bourgeois intelligentsia" was condemned for producing "bourgeois ideology", which were all non-Marxist worldviews. Language reforms followed revolutions more than once, such as the [[New Korean Orthography]] in North Korea (which failed due to [[Korean ethnic nationalism|Korean ethnic nationalist]] fears of precluding [[Korean unification]]), or the simplification of Chinese characters under [[Mao Zedong]] (a consequence of the divergent orthographic choices of [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]), or the [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|simplification of the Russian language after the 1917 revolution]] in Russia and consequent struggle against illiteracy, known in Soviet Russia as ''[[Likbez]]'' (''Likvidaciya Bezgramotnosti'', liquidation of illiteracy).

They believed in rapid industrialization through labor and in subjecting nature to human will. By restructuring social classes into a mass of people who are theoretically all equal, the North Korean government claimed it would be able to attain self-reliance or ''Juche'' in upcoming years. This is questionable, because the country suffers massive food shortages annually and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=404–05}}

=== ''Songun'' ===
{{main article|Songun}}
''Songun'' (literally "military-first policy") was first mentioned on 7 April 1997 in ''[[Rodong Shinmun]]'' under the headline "There Is a Victory for Socialism in the Guns and Bombs of the People's Army".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} It defined the military-centered thinking of the time by stating; "the revolutionary philosophy to safeguard our own style of socialism under any circumstances".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} The concept was credited to "Respected General Kim Jong-il".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=63}} In a joint editorial on 16 June 1998 entitled "Our Party's Military-First Politics Will Inevitably Achieve Victory and Will Never Be Defeated" by ''[[Kulloja]]'' (the WPK theoretical magazine) and ''Rodong Sinmun'', it was stated that ''Songun'' meant "the leadership method under the principle of giving priority to the military and resolving the problems that may occur in the course of revolution and construction as well as establishing the military as the main body of the revolution in the course of achieving the total tasks of socialism".{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} While the article clearly referred to "our Party", this was not a reference to the WPK but rather to the personal leadership of Kim Jong-il.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} On 5 September 1998, the [[Constitution of North Korea|North Korean Constitution]] was revised and it made clear that the [[National Defence Commission]], the highest military body, was the supreme body of the state.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}} This date is considered the beginning of the ''Songun'' era.{{sfn|Kihl|Kim|2006|p=64}}

== ''Juche'' in practice ==
In the view of some observers, ''Juche'' is not mere rhetoric, but rather an ideal of self-reliance that North Korea has attempted to put into practice.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=419}}{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref name="Bluth"&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea|last=Bluth|first=Christoph|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-07456-3357-2|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomacy ===
Based ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il argued: "Independence is not in conflict with internationalism but is the basis of its strengthening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that North Korea co-operated with "socialist countries", the "international communist movement" and "newly-emerging nations" on the basis of non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea emerged from Soviet occupation and fought alongside the Chinese Communists in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Korean War]]. However, it soon asserted its independence from both the Soviet Union and China. Though it rejected [[de-Stalinization]], it avoided taking sides in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. As the [[Communist bloc]] split, introduced market reforms and collapsed, North Korea increasingly emphasized ''Juche'' in both theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael E Robinson |date= 2007 |title= Korea's Twentieth Century Odyssey |publisher= University of Hawaii Books |pp=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buzo"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea was admitted to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1975 and began to present itself as a leader of the [[Third World]]. It fostered diplomatic relations with developing countries and promoted ''Juche'' as a model for others to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong |first=Charles |title=Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations |journal=NKIDP Working Paper |date=April 2009 |issue=1 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_Working_Paper_1_Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations_web.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307074422/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_Working_Paper_1_Juche_and_North_Koreas_Global_Aspirations_web.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The DPRK Diplomatic Relations |last1=Wertz |first1=Daniel |last2=Oh |first2=JJ |last3=Kim |first3=Insung |year=2015 |publisher=National Committee on North Korea |url=http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_DPRK_Diplomatic_Relations.pdf |p=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085503/http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_DPRK_Diplomatic_Relations.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

National survival has been seen as a guiding principle of North Korea's diplomatic strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi |authorlink= Sheila Miyoshi Jager | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the midst of economic and political crises, North Korea continues to emphasize its independence on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|pp=471–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
In ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il stated: "In order to implement the principle of economic self-sufficiency, one must build an independent national economy".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; More specifically, he stated, "Heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its backbone is the pillar of an independent national economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasized the importance of technological independence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-sufficiency in resources.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stated that this did not rule out international economic co-operation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1956, Kim Il-sung declared ''Juche'' to be the guiding principle of the economy. After the devastation of the Korean War, North Korea began to rebuild its economy with a base in heavy industry, with the aim of becoming as self-sufficient as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, North Korea developed what has been called the "most [[autarky|autarkic]] industrial economy in the world".{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=419}}&lt;ref name="Michael E Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael E Robinson |date= 2007 |title= Korea's Twentieth Century Odyssey |publisher= University of Hawaii Books |p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea received a lot of economic aid and technical assistance from the Soviet Union and China, but it did not join [[Comecon]], the Communist common market.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=420}}&lt;ref name="Bluth"/&gt; In the 1990s, it had one of the world's lowest rates for dependence on petroleum, using hydroelectric power and coal instead of imported oil.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|p=426}} Its textile industry uses [[vinylon]], known as the "''Juche'' fiber", which was invented by a Korean and which is made from locally available coal and limestone.{{sfn|Abt|2014|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |pp=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the development of vinylon often featured in propaganda that preached the virtues of technological self-reliance.&lt;ref name="Michael E Robinson"/&gt; North Korea had 10,000 [[CNC]] machines in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/m/read.php?cataId=nk01300&amp;num=6136|title=Vinylon and CNC? What are they good for?|author=|date=18 March 2010|publisher=|access-date=16 October 2017|via=DailyNK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first domestic homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995 and in 2017 it has around 15,000 machines.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-technology/how-a-homemade-tool-helped-north-koreas-missile-program-idUSKBN1CH1I4|title=How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program|author=|date=13 October 2017|publisher=|access-date=15 October 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have often pointed out the discrepancy between the principle of self-sufficiency and North Korea's dependence on foreign aid, especially during its economic crisis in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of economic autarky has been blamed for contributing to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=147–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, attempts at self-sufficiency led to inefficiency and to the neglect of export opportunities in industries where there was a [[comparative advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense ===
In ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il stated: "Self-reliance in defense is a fundamental principle of an independent sovereign state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that it was possible to get aid from friends and allies, but that this would be effective only if the state was militarily strong in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated a state where "all the people are under arms and the whole country becomes a fortress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated the development of a local defense industry to avoid dependence on foreign arms suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Juche Idea|author=Kim Jong-il|date=1982|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea has attempted to put this into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean People's Army]] is one of the largest on earth.

== Religious features of ''Juche'' ==
Some South Korean scholars categorize ''Juche'' as a national religion or they compare its facets to those of some [[religion]]s. For instance, ''Juche'' has been compared to pre-existing religions in Korea (notably [[neo-Confucianism]] and [[Korean shamanism]]) due to their shared familiar principles.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}} While the influence of traditional [[East Asia]]n religions on ''Juche'' is widely disputed, the ideology has been thought of by several academic studies as having aspects of a national and indigenous religious movement in addition to being a political philosophy due to the following features: the presence of a sacred leader, rituals and familism.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoare|first1=James|title=Historical Dictionary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow|location=Lanham, MD|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the religious features of ''Juche'', it is a highly [[atheistic]] ideology that discourages the practice of mainstream religions. This draws from ''Juche''{{'}}s Marxist−Leninist origins. North Korea is officially an [[State atheism|atheist state]], but maintains a [[cult of personality]] identical to a religion, much like the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].

=== Presence of a Sacred Leader ===
Although the ideology appears to emphasize the central role of the human individual, ''Juche'' can be fulfilled only through the masses’ subordination to a single leader and accordingly, his successor. The ideology teaches that the role of a Great Leader is essential for the popular masses to succeed in their revolutionary movement because without leadership they are unable to survive.{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=205}} This is the foundation of [[North Korean cult of personality]] surrounding Kim Il Sung. The personality cult explains how the ''Juche'' ideology has been able to endure until today, even during the North Korean government's undeniable dependence on foreign assistance during [[North Korean famine|its famine]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow"/&gt; The concept of the "Sacred leader" in ''Juche'' as well as the cult around the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]] has been compared to the [[State Shinto]] ideology of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in which the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] was seen as a [[Imperial cult|divine being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2015/02/north-koreas-kim-family-cult-roots-in-state-shinto/|title=North Korea’s Kim family cult: Roots in Japanese state Shinto?|last=Halpin|first=Dennis|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the fundamental belief in the essential role of the Great Leader, the former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung has become the "supreme deity for the people" and the ''Juche'' doctrine is reinforced in North Korea's constitution as the country’s guiding principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumings|first1=Bruce|title=North Korea: Another Country|date=2003|publisher=New|location=New York|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel relationship structure between Kim Il-sung and his people to religious founders or leaders and their followers has led many scholars to consider ''Juche'' a religious movement as much as a political ideology.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}} However, those familiar with cults would again posit that ''Juche'' bypasses the tenants of religion completely and instead meets the criteria of a totalitarian cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomofmind.com/north-korea-hopefully-not-a-potential-global-waco/|title=North Korea: Hopefully Not a Potential Global Waco? - Freedom of Mind Resource Center|date=20 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Juche'''s emphasis on the political and sacred role of the leader and the ensuing worshipping by the popular masses has been critiqued by various intellectual [[Marxism|Marxists]].{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=205}} They argue that the North Korean working class or the proletariat has been stripped of their honor and therefore call the cult of personality non-Marxist and non-democratic.{{sfn|Helgesen|1991|p=206}}

=== Rituals ===
The religious behavior of ''Juche'' can also be seen in the perspectives of the North Korean people through refugee interviews from former participants in North Korea’s ritual occasions. One pertinent example is the [[Arirang Festival]], which is a gymnastics and artistic festival held in the [[Rungnado May Day Stadium]] in Pyongyang. All components of the festival, from the selection of performers, mobilization of resources, recruitment of the audience and publicity for the show have been compared to facets of a national religious event.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=101}}

The Arirang Festival has been described to demonstrate the power of the North Korean government to arrange a form of religious gathering. It has done so by "appropriating a mass of bodies for calisthenic and performative arts representing the leader as the Father and his faithful followers".{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}} The Festival's effectiveness in transforming its participants into loyal disciples of ''Juche'' seems to originate from the [[Collectivism|collectivist principle]] of "one for all and all for one" and the ensuing emotional bond and loyalty to the leader.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}} According to the accounts of refugees who have been recruited to mass gymnastics, the collectivist principle has been nurtured through physical punishment such as beatings and more importantly the organization of recruits into small units, whose performances were held accountable by larger units.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=111}} The Festival’s ritualistic components of collectivism serve to reinforce a "certain structure of sociality and affect", establishing Kim Il Sung as the "Father" in both the body and psyche of the performers.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=96}}

=== Familism ===
[[Charles K. Armstrong]] argues that familism has transformed itself into a kind of political religion in the form of ''Juche''. With the emergence of ''Juche'' as North Korea's guiding political principle since the 1960s, the familial relationship within the micro-family unit has been translated into a national, macro-unit with Kim Il-sung representing the father figure and the North Korean people representing his children. ''Juche'' is thus based on the language of family relationships with its East Asian or neo-Confucian "resonances of filial piety and maternal love".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=383}}

[[File:Tributestojuche.jpg|thumb|150px|North Korea claims that the ''Juche'' idea has a wide international following which displays tributes from other socialist movements towards the idea in the entrance hall of the [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]]]]
Armstrong also notes that North Korea has actually transferred the "[[filial piety]] of nationalism in the family of the leader himself" by positioning Kim Il-sung as the universal [[patriarch]].{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=389}} He argues that while the official pursuit of the ''Juche'' ideology in the 1960s signaled North Korea's desire to separate from the "fraternity of international socialism", the ideology also replaced Stalin as the father figure with Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=390}} In effect, North Korea's familial nationalism has supplanted the "rather abstract, class-oriented language of socialism with a more easily understandable and identifiable language of familial connections, love and obligations".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=384}}

The cult of personality surrounding Kim expanded into a family cult when Kim Jong Il became the heir apparent after assuming important posts in the WPK and military in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim's Son 'Only One' to Take Over|agency=[[South China Morning Post]] &amp; the Hongkong Telegraph|issue=12|date=20 April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong calls this a "family romance", which is a term Freud had used to describe "the neurotic replacement of a child's real parents with fantasy substitutes".{{sfn|Armstrong|2005|p=385}} Through the establishment of the North Korean family romance with the language, symbols and rituals related to familism, Kim Il Sung has been consecrated even further posthumously as the Great Father.{{sfn|Jung|2013|p=95}}

== Criticism ==
Throughout the 1990s, the North Korean regime became increasingly nationalistic—at least, in its official pronouncements—leading Kim Chonghun to state that "Socialism of our Style" was really "Socialism without Socialism".{{sfn|Shin|2006|pp=91–94}} Speeches and official announcements made references to socialism, but neither to Marxist–Leninist thought nor to any basic communist concepts.{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=93}} Shin Gi-wook argues that "there is no trace of Marxist–Leninism or the Stalinist notion of nationhood [in North Korea]. Instead, Kim stresses the importance of the Korean people's blood, soul and national traits, echoing earlier Korean nationalists such as [[Sin Chaeho]], Yi Kwangsu and [[Choe Namson]]. He no longer has any interest in applying Marxism–Leninism to the North Korean situation; indeed it is no longer useful for the country".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=93}}

[[Charles K. Armstrong]] says that "North Korean Communism would not only be quite distinctive from the Soviet model, it would in some respects turn Marxism–Leninism upside-down".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}} The key differences are that the North Koreans place the primacy of ideology over materialism, retaining the vocabulary of family lineage and nationalism and giving it primacy over [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and supporting social distinction and hierarchy over classless society and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}} He concluded that North Korea may look "Stalinist in form", but that it was "nationalist in content".{{sfn|Shin|2006|p=94}}

[[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology, regarding its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners. He argues that it exists to be praised and not actually read.&lt;ref name="Rank"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html |title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers |first=Michael |last=Rank |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |publisher=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his own experiences living in North Korea, [[Felix Abt]] describes Myers' arguments as "shaky" and "questionable". Having seen the extent to which North Korean university students actually believe in ''Juche'', Abt says it is "rather absurd" to describe the ideology as "window-dressing" for foreigners. He also questions how only three decades of Japanese occupation could simply upend the impact of "thousands of years" of history in Korea.{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=62–63}}

[[Dae-Sook Suh]] has stated that Kim-Il Sung had failed to explain the difference between [[Socialist patriotism]] and nationalism which Kim stated he opposed. Suh also criticised Kim for allegedly failing to explain how Marxism–Leninism has been applied to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il-Sung: The North Korean Leader&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">In the [[philosophy of science]], under the [[correspondence principle]], a '''limiting case''' [[theory]] is an earlier theory which becomes incorporated into a later, usually broader theory; that is to say, the earlier (limiting case) theory proves to be a special or limited case of the later theory. Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that [[classical mechanics]] constitutes a low-energy limiting case of [[relativity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivadulla, Andres: [https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/481-2013-10-14-TheNewtonianLimit.pdf The Newtonian Limit of Relativity Theory and the Rationality of Theory Change], Synthese 141:417–429, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, James (2013): "Toward a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience", in ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience'', Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In words of [[Larry Laudan]], [[scientific realism|realist]] philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be a limiting case of [the theory] T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only if (a) ''all'' the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are assigned a value by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as, or very close to, the values T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions—consistent with T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—are specified".

The idea that a theory (in our previous example, [[Newtonian mechanics]]) that is close to being true (i.e., that is [[verisimil]]) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, [[relativistic mechanics]]) can be an argument for [[scientific realism]], as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.

This is a '''list of [[German language|German-language]] [[philosopher]]s'''.  The following [[individuals]] have written [[philosophical]] texts in the [[German language]]. Many are categorized as [[:Category:German philosophers|German philosophers]] or [[:Category:Austrian philosophers|Austrian philosophers]], but some are neither [[Germans|German]] nor [[Austria]]n by [[ethnicity]] or [[nationality]]. Each one, however, satisfies at least one of the following criteria:

# s/he has been identified as a philosopher in any reputable, reliable encyclopedic/scholarly publication (e.g. MacMillan, Stanford, Routledge, Oxford, Metzler.)''
# s/he has written multiple articles published in reputable, reliable journals of philosophy and/or written books that were reviewed in such journals.

'''Mary Kate McGowan''' is the Luella LaMer Professor of Women’s Studies as well as Professor of Philosophy at [[Wellesley College]].&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Mary Kate McGowan: January 2014|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/marykatemcgowanjanuary2014|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association.|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGowan has written a large number of peer-reviewed articles, contributed three commissioned book chapters, and has co-edited one book - ''Speech and Harm: Controversies Over Free Speech''.&lt;ref name=Obio/&gt;  

==Education and career==
McGowan received her bachelor's degree at Wellesley College in philosophy and mathematics in 1990, going on to receive a master's (1993) and a doctorate (1996) in philosophy from Princeton University.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Kate McGowan|first=Mary|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/sites/default/files/profilecv5_2012.pdf|publisher=Wellesley College|accessdate=5 January 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving her doctorate, McGowan accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]], which she left to accept a position as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College in 1998.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; McGowan received a promotion to Associate Professor in 2004, and full Professor in 2011.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; McGowan currently serves as the Luella LaMer Professor of Women's Studies, and also previously served as the Class of 1966 Associate Professor (a chair endowed by Wellesley's class of 1966.)&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; 

==Research areas==
McGowan specializes in studying the subtle ways that speech can be used to alter normative facts, and how this technique may be involved in the perpetuation of unjust social systems.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She argues that conversational contributions enact normative fact in a way that is not, at the surface, visible, and in a way that in fact requires little authority.&lt;ref name=sep1&gt;{{cite web|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|title=Feminist Philosophy of Language|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her more recent work has generalized this phenomenon to settings that are not entirely conversational, arguing that sexist speech, some pornography, and some types of hate speech are much more harmful than are currently recognized, and that this has significant implications in public and legal debates over the limits of free speech.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She's also interested how one defines the liminal areas of speech; burning a flag, though not an obvious act of speech, is considered protected speech, whereas orally agreeing to a contract for murder for hire, though most certainly speech, is universally not protected.&lt;ref name=Obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Kate McGowan {{!}} Wellesley college|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/philosophy/faculty/mcgowan|publisher=Wellesley College|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]]'s demonstration of the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion. It is the same demonstration that [[Oresme]] had made centuries earlier.]]

In the 14th-century, the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]] and French collaborators such as [[Nicole Oresme]] proved the '''mean speed theorem''', also known as the '''Merton rule''' of [[uniform acceleration]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Grant]], ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'' (1974) Vol. 1, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Merton mean speed theorem'''. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with [[speed|uniform speed]] whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |chapter=III. Medieval Contributions |pages=79–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Details==
Oresme essentially provided a geometrical verification for the generalized Merton Rule, which we would express today as &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_f)t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., distance traveled is equal to one half of the sum of the initial and final velocities, multiplied by the elapsed time), by finding the area of a [[trapezoid]].&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Edwards, Jr., ''The Historical Development of the Calculus'' (1979) pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay tablets used in [[Babylonian astronomy]] (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and [[Displacement (vector)|motion]] and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ossendrijver |first=Mathieu |date=29 Jan 2016 |title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full |journal=Science |publisher= |volume=351 |issue=6272 |pages=482–484 |doi=10.1126/science.aad8085 |access-date=29 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Sci...351..482O |pmid=26823423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of "[[Law of falling bodies|the law of falling bodies]]" — long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it. The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main [[kinematical]] properties of [[uniformly accelerated motion]]s, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

The theorem is a special case of the more general kinematics equations for uniform acceleration.

In the study of knowledge, Methodism refers to the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] approach where one asks "How do we know?" before "What do we know?" The term appears in [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s "The [[Problem of the Criterion]]", and in the work of his student, [[Ernest Sosa]] ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge"). Methodism is contrasted with [[Epistemological particularism|particularism]], which answers the latter question before the former.

Since the question "How do we know?" does not presuppose that we know, it is receptive to skepticism. In this way, Sosa claims, [[David Hume|Hume]] no less than [[Descartes]] was an epistemological Methodist.

'''''My Dinner with Andre''''' is a 1981 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Louis Malle]], and written by and starring [[Andre Gregory]] (Andre) and [[Wallace Shawn]] (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at [[Café des Artistes]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1999-06-20/entertainment/9906200314_1_peter-sellers-dr-strangelove-two-great-films Johnson, Malcolm, "Cinestudio Salutes Columbia", ''Hartford Courant'' (June 20, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dialogue covers such things as [[experimental theatre]], the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest [[humanism]] with Andre's spiritual experiences.

==Structure==
Andre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and a group of Polish actors in a forest in [[Poland]], his visit to [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]] in Scotland, and his trip to the [[Sahara]] to try to create a play based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|St.-Exupéry]]. He worked with a group in a small piece of [[performance art]] on [[Long Island]], which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) [[Premature burial#Voluntary burial|buried alive]] on [[Halloween]] night.

The rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnopédies|Gymnopédie No. 1]]'' plays in the background.

==Cast==
*[[Andre Gregory]] as Andre
*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Wally
*Jean Lenauer as waiter
*Roy Butler&lt;!--- not the politician ---&gt; as bartender

==Production==
The idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation.&lt;ref name="Criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2009, Shawn said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of ''me'' there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.&lt;ref name="wally"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director [[Louis Malle]]. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;

''My Dinner with Andre'' was filmed in the [[Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia)|Jefferson Hotel]], which was then vacant, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) [[Lloyd Kaufman]] was the production manager on the film, and [[Troma Entertainment]] provided production support.&lt;ref name="damn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt; The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic [[Café des Artistes]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips Taubin, Amy, "My Dinner with Andre: Long Strange Trips", ''The Criterion Collection'' (June 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave high praise to the film on ''[[Sneak Previews]]''; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year.&lt;ref name="barnes20130404"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ebert-dies-film-critic-406274 | title=Critic Roger Ebert Dies at 70 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=2013-04-04 | accessdate=April 4, 2013 | author=Barnes, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his ''Great Movies'' essay series. He said, "Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, ''My Dinner with Andre''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-my-dinner-with-andre-1981 "My Dinner with Andre."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]] ranked it as the "Best American Film" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best [[Screenplay]].

== Notes ==
Throughout the film, Andre references his wife "Chiquita"; in real life he was married to Mercedes "Chiquita" Nebelthau, who died in 1992.&lt;ref name=Chiquita&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/12/arts/mercedes-gregory-film-maker-dead-documentarian-56.html |title=Mercedes Gregory, Film Maker, Dead; Documentarian, 56 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about [[Jerzy Grotowski]], whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.&lt;ref name=Chiquita/&gt;

Throughout the film, Wally references his "girlfriend Debbie". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer [[Deborah Eisenberg]], although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips |title=My Dinner with André: Long, Strange Trips |first=Amy |last=Taubin |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">In the [[applied sciences]], '''normative science''' is a type of information that is developed, presented, or interpreted based on an assumed, usually unstated, preference for a particular policy or class of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2004).  [http://fw.oregonstate.edu/system/files/u2937/2004c%20-%20Normative%20Science%20-%20Reprint%20-%20Lackey.pdf Normative Science], Fisheries, American Fisheries Society.  29(7): 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular or traditional [[science]] does not presuppose a [[policy]] preference, but normative science, by definition, does.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, Gorik. (2014). [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/14/36 From international health to global health: how to foster better dialogue between empirical and normative disciplines]. BMC International Health and Human Rights. 14: 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Common examples of such policy preferences are arguments that pristine [[ecosystems]] are preferable to human altered ones, that native species are preferable to nonnative species, and that higher [[biodiversity]] is preferable to lower biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00639.x/abstract;jsessionid=1E4F2F827867D075DD43D28821A08A13.d03t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+3+Dec+from+10-12+GMT+for+monthly+maintenance Science, scientists, and policy advocacy].

Conservation Biology. 26(1): 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general philosophical terms, normative science is a form of [[inquiry]], typically involving a community of inquiry and its accumulated body of provisional knowledge, that seeks to discover good ways of achieving recognized aims, ends, goals, objectives, or purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine, George H. (1912). [https://archive.org/details/jstor-2177252 Descriptive and normative sciences]. The Philosophical Review. 21(4): 433-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brueckner, Martin and Pierre Horwitz. (2005). [http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol1iss2/0412-017.brueckner.html The use of science in environmental policy: a case study of the Regional Forest Agreement process in Western Australia]. Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy. 1(2): 14-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many political debates revolve around arguments over which of the many "good ways" shall be selected.&lt;ref&gt;Short, T. L. (2012). [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/transactions_of_the_charles_s_peirce_society/v048/48.3.short01.html Normative science?] Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 48(3): 310-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when presented as scientific information, words such as [[ecosystem health]], [[biological integrity]], and [[environmental degradation]] are typically examples of normative science because they each presuppose a policy preference and are therefore a type of [[policy advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Wayne G. (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.5630030312/full The Exxon Valdez oil spill revisited and the dangers of normative science].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to epistemology:

'''[[Epistemology]]''' or '''theory of knowledge''' &amp;ndash;  branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with the nature and scope of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, 1967, Macmillan, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced into English by the Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier]] (1808–1864).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Epistemology asks the questions: "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", and "What do people know?"

[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|250px|right| According to [[Plato]], knowledge is a subset of that which is both true and believed{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.]]

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Essence of epistemology==

* [[Descriptive knowledge]] ("knowledge that")
* [[Scientific method]]
* [[Truth]]

== Branches of epistemology ==

* [[Alethiology]] &amp;ndash;  the study of the nature of truth
* [[Formal epistemology]] &amp;ndash; subdiscipline of [[epistemology]] that uses [[formal methods]] from [[logic]], [[probability theory]] and [[computability theory]] to elucidate traditional epistemic problems.
* [[Meta-epistemology]] &amp;ndash; [[metaphilosophical]] study of the subject, matter, [[philosophical method|methods]] and aims of [[epistemology]] and of approaches to understanding and structuring our knowledge of knowledge itself.
* [[Social epistemology]]

== Epistemological theories ==
===Justification===
* [[Theory of justification|Theories of justification]]
** [[Foundationalism]] &amp;ndash; Self-evident basic beliefs justify other non-basic beliefs.
** [[Coherentism]] &amp;ndash; Beliefs are justified if they cohere with other beliefs a person holds, each belief is justified if it coheres with the overall system of beliefs.
** [[Internalism]] &amp;ndash; The believer must be able to justify a belief through internal knowledge.
** [[Externalism]] &amp;ndash; Outside sources of knowledge can be used to justify a belief.
** [[Philosophical skepticism#Epistemology and skepticism|Skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A variety of viewpoints questioning the possibility of knowledge.
*** [[Academic skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A school of skepticism which rejects the existence of truth and maintains that knowledge is impossible.
*** [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A school of skepticism which emphasises suspension of belief to attain [[ataraxia#Pyrrhonism|ataraxia]] (tranquility of mind).
** Minority viewpoints include:
*** [[Foundherentism]] &amp;ndash; A combination of foundationalism and coherentism proposed by [[Susan Haack]].
*** [[Infinitism]] &amp;ndash; Beliefs are justified by infinite chains of reasons, as proposed by [[Peter D. Klein]].
* [[Theory of justification#Justifiers|Common justifiers]]
** [[Scientific method]] &amp;ndash; body of [[Scientific technique|technique]]s for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]], acquiring new&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[knowledge]], or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.  A scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Occam's Razor]] &amp;ndash; the principle that "entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity" (''entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem''). The popular interpretation of this principle is that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. However, this is often confused, as the 'simple' "is really referring to the theory with the fewest new assumptions." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theness.com/the-razor-in-the-toolbox/ The NESS: The Razor in the Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Empiricism]] &amp;ndash; theory of [[knowledge]] that asserts that knowledge arises from [[evidence]] gathered via [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]].  Empiricism emphasizes the role of [[experience]] and [[evidence]], especially [[sensory perception]], in the formation of ideas, over the notion of [[innate idea]]s or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Induction (philosophy)|Induction]] &amp;ndash; kind of [[reasoning]] that allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false even where all of the premises are true.&lt;ref&gt;John Vickers. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ The Problem of Induction].

** [[Pragmatism]] &amp;ndash; philosophical movement that includes those who claim that an ideology or [[proposition]] is true if it works satisfactorily, that the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it, and that impractical ideas are to be rejected.
** [[Probability theory]] &amp;ndash; branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with analysis of [[Statistical randomness|random]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375936 Probability theory, Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The central objects of probability theory are [[random variable]]s, [[stochastic process]]es, and [[event (probability theory)|event]]s: mathematical abstractions of [[determinism|non-deterministic]] events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an ''apparently'' random fashion.  If repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted.
** [[Abductive Reasoning]] or [[Inference to the Best Explanation]] &amp;ndash; kind of logical inference described by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as the process of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis.  Thus, to abduce a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as a conclusion from a noticed curious circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as a premise, is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Perspectivism''' ({{lang-de|Perspektivismus}}) is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view (touched upon as far back as [[Plato]]'s rendition of [[Protagoras]]) that all ideations take place from particular [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s, and that there are many possible [[conceptual scheme]]s, or perspectives in which judgment of [[truth]] or value can be made. This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively "true", but does ''not'' necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that all perspectives are equally valid. The term was coined by nineteenth-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

==View==
Perspectivism rejects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of [[Noumenon|a thing-in-itself]]. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no [[ethics|ethical]] or [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[wikt:absolute|absolutes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2005, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "Truth" is thus created by integrating different vantage points together.

People always adopt perspectives by default &amp;ndash; whether they are aware of it or not &amp;ndash; and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Kakures, Dion, ''History of Philosophy'', 1993, page 346&lt;/ref&gt; This view differs from many types of [[relativism]] which consider the truth of a particular [[proposition]] as something that altogether cannot be [[Validity (logic)|evaluated]] with respect to an "absolute truth", without taking into consideration [[culture]] and context.&lt;ref name="Appearance and the thing-in-itself"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Human, All Too Human|date=1878|chapter=Section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]''&lt;!--quotations from Nietzsche's Nachlass/The Will to Power must be cited to confirm this in Description--&gt;:

{{Quotation|In so far as the word "knowledge" has any meaning, the world is knowable; but it is ''interpretable'' [emphasis in original] otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings.—"Perspectivism."

''It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their For and Against.'' [emphasis added] Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to compel all the other drives to accept as a norm.|Friedrich Nietzsche; trans. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]|''The Will to Power'', §481 (1883–1888)&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Soweit überhaupt das Wort »Erkenntniß« Sinn hat, ist die Welt erkennbar: aber sie ist anders ''deutbar'', sie hat keinen Sinn hinter sich, sondern unzählige Sinne. – »Perspektivismus«. ¶ Unsere Bedürfnisse sind es, die die Welt auslegen; unsere Triebe und deren Für und Wider. Jeder Trieb ist eine Art Herrschsucht, jeder hat seine Perspektive, welche er als Norm allen übrigen Trieben aufzwingen möchte.'' (''Wille zur Macht'', [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6029/24 Nr. 481].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Interpretation===
[[Richard Schacht]], in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]" in relation to "[[subjectivity]]" as an aggregate of singular viewpoints that illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways but upon closer inspection would reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (e.g., that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination. Nevertheless, perspectivism does not implicate any method of inquiry nor a [[structuralism|structural]] theory of knowledge in general.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993.{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[contemporary philosophy]], perspectivism was revived by [[José Ortega y Gasset]].&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Holmes, Oliver, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/ "José Ortega y Gasset"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Summer 2011 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of Eating''' is a concept of food production and nutritional philosophy that matches the source and result of health together.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital [[micronutrients]] generally lost in most food processing.

Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where [[advertising]] along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present.  The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements.

==History==
As a book [[The Philosophy of Eating]] by author [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] in the late 1860s,.&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Bellows (1868) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_Eating_1868.html?id=7Td5xyWSFb4C originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton] 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the middle to late 1860's era.  So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher.

More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in [[raw foodism]] for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including [[vegan|vegan food preparation]] and offshoots related. The [[micronutrients]] [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s aid digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a variety of shared characteristics of the origins of food spelled out in the 1860s book started to mainstream more so as a backlash to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html |title="How to Eat in Seven Words", an article at Dr. Andrew Weil |author=Brad Lemley|publisher=drweil.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the sourcing to consumption in thought as well a contexts for acceptability.

Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by [[George Davey]] who published a 2013 book called ''Break the Trance''.  [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]]
.&lt;ref&gt;George Davey (2013) [http://lccn.loc.gov/2013938024 The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing]  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic.

==Experiences==

Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood.

Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Carrien and Tamra (2006) [http://foodthatnourishes.blogspot.com/2006/10/philosophy-of-eating.html 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution]  2006&lt;/ref&gt; blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach.

Though cited in [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]], health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake.

==Contrast==

Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

Particularly, the scientific basis is now better understood and psychological remediation or behavior patterns are more amenable to that of a reader in modern times contrasted with processed food celebration by.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Kim (2013) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=processed-food-a-two-million-year-history 'Processed Food: A 2-Million-Year History', It is the dark force, we're told, behind the obesity epidemic, the death of the family farm and Tang...]  2013&lt;/ref&gt; The continued strength of industrialized food troubles some people though.

In [[linguistics]], a ''quantized expression'' is such that, whenever it is true of some entity,  it is ''not'' true of any proper subparts of that entity.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

For example, if something is an "apple", then no proper subpart of that thing is an "apple". If something is "water", then many of its subparts will also be "water". Hence, "apple" is quantized, while "water" is not.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Quantization has proven relevant to the proper characterization of grammatical [[telicity]] (roughly, sentences that present events as '''bounded/unbounded''' in time) and the [[mass noun|mass/count]] distinction for [[nouns]]. The notion was first applied{{when|date=April 2017}}{{why|date=April 2017}} to linguistic [[semantics]] by the linguist [[Manfred Krifka]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Definition==
Formally, a '''quantization''' predicate ''QUA'' can be defined as follows, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universe of discourse]], &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a variable over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[mereology|mereological]] part [[mathematical structure|structure]] on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; &lt;_p&lt;/math&gt; the [[mereology|mereological]] part-of [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]:{{clarifyme|date=April 2017}}{{fact|date=April 2017}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\forall F\subseteq U_p)(QUA(F) \iff (\forall x,y)(F(x)\wedge F(y) \Rightarrow \neg x&lt;_p y))&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[rose]] has long been used as a symbol. "[[Rose (color)|Rose]]" means pink or red in a variety of languages (such as the [[Romance languages]], and Greek).

==In religion==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Venus Verticordia.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus Verticordia]]'' (1868) by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], showing the goddess [[Aphrodite]] surrounded by red roses]]
===Greco-Roman religion===
In [[ancient Greece]], the rose was closely associated with the goddess [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cyrino|first=Monica S.|date=2010|title=Aphrodite|series=Gods and Heroes of the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7gyVn5GjXPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aphrodite+Monica+S.+Cyrino#v=onepage&amp;q=Aphrodite%20Monica%20S.%20Cyrino&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-77523-6|pages=63, 96|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Nora|date=2015|title=Aphrodite and Venus in Myth and Mimesis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Aw7nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=rose+symbol+Aphrodite#v=onepage&amp;q=rose%20symbol%20Aphrodite&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-7127-3|pages=209–210|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'', Aphrodite protects the body of [[Hector]] using the "immortal oil of the rose"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D23%3Acard%3D161 23.185–187]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; and the archaic Greek lyric poet [[Ibycus]] praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibycus]], fragment 288.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; The second-century AD Greek travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] associates the rose with the story of [[Adonis]] and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Paus.%206.24.7 6.24.7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyrino2010"/&gt; Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] contains a scene in which the goddess [[Isis]], who is identified with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a [[donkey]], to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt;

===Christianity===
Following the [[Christianization#Late antiquity (4th-6th centuries)|Christianization of the Roman Empire]], the rose became identified with the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Cucciniello, "Rose to Rosary: The Flower of Venus in Catholicism" in ''Rose Lore: Essays in Semiotics and Cultural History'' (ed. Frankie Hutton: [[Lexington Books]], 2008), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the [[rosary]] and other devotional prayers in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Cucciniello, ''Rose Lore'', at pp. 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; Ever since the 1400s, the [[Franciscans]] have had a Crown Rosary of the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; In the 1400s and 1500s, the [[Carthusians]] promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt; [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s painting ''[[Feast of the Rosary|The Feast of the Rosary]]'' (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt;

===Islam and Sufism===
The cultivation of geometrical gardens, in which the rose has often held pride of place, has a long history in Iran and surrounding lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://lj.uwpress.org/content/4/1/23.short | doi=10.3368/lj.4.1.23| title=The Philosophy of Persian Garden Design: The Sufi Tradition| journal=Landscape Journal| volume=4| pages=23–30| year=1985| last1=Shirvani| first1=Hamid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1941.tb00950.x | volume=31 | issue=4 | title=THE ROSE AND ISLAM | journal=The Muslim World | pages=360–370 | last1 = Marinus Zwemer | first1 = Samuel| year=1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lyric [[ghazal]], it is the beauty of the rose that provokes the longing song of the [[nightingale]]&lt;ref name=Diba2001&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Diba|first=Layla S.|title=Gol o bolbol|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|year=2001|volume=11|pages=52–57|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gol-o-bolbol|accessdate=15 November 2013|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; - an image prominent, for example, in the poems of [[Hafez]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rbs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=sufi+rose#v=onepage&amp;q=sufi%20rose&amp;f=false Julian Baldick in ''History of Persian Literature'' - Google Books;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic's quest for divine love, so that [[Ibn Arabi]], for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the [[Names of God in Islam|divine names and attributes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Arabi, ''The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq'', Trans. R.A.Nicholson, Theosophical Publishing House 1911/1978, p 130, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include;
* The Sufi master [[Jilani]] is known as "the Rose of Baghdad" and his order, the [[Qadiriyya]], uses the rose as its symbol.
*Two prominent books aligned with Sufism are ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|The Rose Garden]]'' by [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]] and [[Mahmud Shabistari]]'s ''[[Gulshan-i Raz|The Rose Garden of Secrets]]''.

==In Europe==
[[File:Santjordi.jpg|thumb|Selling roses on [[St George's Day]] in [[Catalonia]], Spain]]

===Catalonia===
[[Catalan people|Catalans]] on the north eastern Spain have traditionally celebrated [[Saint George's Day]] (April 23)—which commemorates [[Saint George]] (''Sant Jordi''), the [[patron saint]] of the [[Catalonia]] region; as the ''dia dels enamorats''  (lovers' day), on which lovers exchange blood-red roses.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tree, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/23/st-georges-day-catalonia St George's Day with a Catalan twist], ''The Guardian'' (April 23, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England===
[[File:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|The [[Tudor rose]].]]
The rose is the [[National symbols of England|national flower of England]], a usage dating back to the English civil wars of the fifteenth century (later called [[Wars of the Roses]]), in which a [[Red Rose of Lancaster|red rose represented the House of Lancaster]], and a [[White Rose of York|white rose represented the House of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Childs, "Places and Peoples: Region and Nation" in ''British Cultural Identities'' (4th ed.: eds. Mike Storry &amp; Peter Childs; Routledge, 2013), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tudor dynasty]] created the [[Tudor rose]], which united both the white and the red roses, a symbolism dramatized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in his play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Goodwin, ''Fatal Rivalry: Flodden, 1513: Henry VIII and James IV and the Decisive Battle for Renaissance Britain'' (W. W. Norton: 2013), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Robinson, ''Court Politics, Culture and Literature in Scotland and England, 1500-1540'' (Ashgate: 2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional ballad "[[The Rose of England]]" ([[Child Ballads|Child]] 166) recounts the seizure of the crown by Earl of Richmond (who became [[Henry VII of England]], the founder the Tudor dynasty), using the "red rose" as an allegory for Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha Würzbach &amp; Simone M. Salz, ''Motif Index of the Child Corpus'' ([[Walter de Gruyter]], 1995), pp. 175-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[England national rugby union team]] and [[Rugby Football Union]] adopted the red rose as their symbol in 1871, and the rose has appeared on players' [[Rugby union equipment|kit]] ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandrugby.com/twickenham/world-rugby-museum/rugby-history/the-england-kit/ Rugby History: Evolution of the England Kit], [[Rugby Football Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In North America==

===United States===
In 1986, the rose was adopted as the national floral emblem of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;36 U.S.C. § 303 ("The flower commonly known as the rose is the national floral emblem.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Buchmann, ''The Reason for Flowers: Their History, Culture, Biology, and How They Change Our Lives'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2016), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] of five U.S. states: 
*[[Iowa]] - the wild rose was adopted as the state's flower in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Naeve, [http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/1996/9-13-1996/wildrose.html Iowa's State Flower - the Wild Rose] (September 13, 1996), ''Horticulture &amp; Home Pest News'' (Iowa State University Extension and Outreach).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[North Dakota]] - The wild prairie rose was adopted as the official state flower of North Dakota in 1907. The colors of the rose (green and pink) had previously been adopted by the first graduating class of the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndstudies.gov/state_flower Wild Prairie Rose], [[State Historical Society of North Dakota]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] - the Cherokee rose (''[[Rosa laevigata|R. laevigata]]'') was adopted as the state's official floral emblem in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/government/article/georgia-state-symbols/georgia-state-flower-cherokee-rose Georgia State Flower (Cherokee Rose)], ''GeorgiaInfo: An Online Georgia Almanac'', [[Digital Library of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[New York (state)|New York]] - In 1955, the state adopted the rose as the state flower; the legislation stated: "The rose shall be the official flower of the state in any color or combination of colors common to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/emblems/flower.htm New York State Flower - Rose], [[New York State Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oklahoma]] - In 2004, Oklahoma adopted a new cultivar named Oklahoma rose as state flower.

[[Portland, Oregon]] has counted "City of Roses" among its nicknames (see [[roses in Portland, Oregon]]) since 1888,&lt;ref name="RosaISmith"&gt;Rosa Inocencio Smith, [https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/05/orbital-view-city-of-roses/481215/ Orbital View: City of Roses], ''The Atlantic'' (May 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and has held an annual [[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]] since 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/unitedstates/oregon/portland/fdrs_feat_121_4.html Coming Up Roses], ''[[Fodor's]]'' (2006) (republished by the ''New York Times'').&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also known for its [[International Rose Test Garden]].&lt;ref name="RosaISmith"/&gt;

[[Pasadena, California]]—also nicknamed the "City of Roses"—has held the annual [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] since 1890, and 1902 the Parade has been held in conjunction with the [[Rose Bowl Game]] (which is now played at the city's [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] stadium, built in 1922).&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Huneven, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/travel/escapes/19HOUR.html?pagewanted=all 37 Hours: Pasadena, Calif.], ''New York Times'' (September 19, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/12/31/sports/ncaafootball/Rose-Bowl.html#1 The Rose Bowl's Storied History], ''New York Times'' (December 31, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government's]] [[list of space agencies|space program]] agency, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), celebrated the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s 21st anniversary by releasing an image of [[spiral galaxies]] [[Arp 273]] positioned in a rose-like shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |date=April 20, 2011 |title=NASA's Hubble Celebrates 21st Anniversary with 'Rose' of Galaxies |publisher=[[NASA]] |page= |url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/hubble-rose.html|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red rose is also part of the official logo of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dsausa.org/about_dsa|title = What Is Democratic Socialism?|date = |accessdate = December 15, 2015|website = |publisher = Democratic Socialists of America|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; being a symbol of socialism generally.&lt;ref name="The Rose and the Fist"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fruitsofourlabour.blogspot.com/2006/08/rose-and-fist.html |title=The Rose and the Fist |last=n/a |first=n/a |date=2006-08-27 |website=The Fruits of Our Labour |access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Canada===
In 1930, ''[[Rosa acicularis]]'' (the wild rose or prickly rose) was adopted as the [[Symbols of Alberta|official provincial flower]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]]. The suggestion that a provincial floral emblem be adopted by first made by an [[Edmonton]] newspaper editor; "the [[Women's Institute]]s took up the suggestion and passed it on to the Department of Education, and the province's schoolchildren made the final choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/games/teachers-corner/fact-sheet-alberta.asp Alberta (AB) - Facts, Flags and Symbols], Government of Canada (accessed May 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/flora-fauna/flora/wild-roses.html Wild Roses], Canadian Wildlife Federation (accessed May 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wildrose Party]], a now-defunct Albertan political party, was named after the province's official flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/multimedia/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-alberta-wildrose-party-1.2877724 The rise and fall of the Alberta Wildrose Party], CBC News (December 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The Mexican city of [[Guadalajara]], the capital of [[Jalisco]], is nicknamed the "City of Roses" (''Ciudad de las Rosas'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1987-10-11/news/26217191_1_plaza-de-la-liberacion-guadalajara-del-sol-shopping-mall The Mexican 'City Of Roses' Where Americans Feel At Home], ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wire services (October 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brooke, ''The Everything Family Guide To Mexico: From Pesos to Parasailing'' (Adams Media, p. 236).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism and social democracy==
{{see also|List of political party symbols}}
The [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]] at [[New York University]] states that the rose "has always been an important symbol with [[anti-authoritarian]] associations."&lt;ref name="Tamiment"&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/aboutlogo.html About Our Logo], [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]], [[New York University]] (accessed May 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The rose is used to show  the end after the means, meaning "lay a rose on the grave". The rose symbol became popular among [[socialist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] political parties in post-[[World War II]] Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Tamiment"/&gt; The symbol of a rose in a fist is used by the [[Socialist International]] "and many of its member parties" such as the [[French Socialist Party]] (PS).&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Socialism'' ([[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2015), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] has used a red rose as its symbol since the late 1980s; the rose replaced the party's previous symbol, the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-10518842 The rise and fall of New Labour], BBC News (August 3, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck, ''A History of the Peoples of the British Isles'' (Vol. 3: [[Psychology Press]], 2002), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21067">In [[philosophy]], '''term logic''', also known as '''traditional logic''', '''syllogistic logic''' or '''[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] logic''', is a loose name for an approach to [[logic]] that began with [[Aristotle]] and that was dominant until the advent of modern predicate logic in the late nineteenth century. This entry is an introduction to the term logic needed to understand philosophy texts written before it was replaced as a [[formal logic]] system by [[predicate logic]]. Readers lacking a grasp of the basic [[terminology]] and ideas of term logic can have difficulty understanding such texts, because their authors typically assumed an acquaintance with term logic.

== Aristotle's system ==

[[Aristotle]]'s logical work is collected in the six texts that are collectively known as the ''[[Organon]]''. Two of these texts in particular, namely the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' and ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', contain the heart of Aristotle's treatment of judgements and formal [[inference]], and it is principally this part of Aristotle's works that is about term [[logic]]. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by [[Jan Lukasiewicz]] of a revolutionary paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jan Lukasiewicz]] approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] and [[Timothy Smiley]] – which informs modern translations of ''Prior Analytics'' by Robin Smith in 1989 and [[Gisela Striker]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;*Review of "Aristotle, Prior Analytics: Book I, Gisela Striker (translation and commentary), Oxford UP, 2009, 268pp., $39.95 (pbk), {{ISBN|978-0-19-925041-7}}." in the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=18787 2010.02.02].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics ==

The fundamental assumption behind the theory is that [[propositions]] are composed of two terms – hence the name "two-term theory" or "term logic" – and that the [[reasoning]] process is in turn built from propositions:
*The ''term'' is a part of speech representing something, but which is not true or false in its own right, such as "man" or "mortal".
*The ''proposition'' consists of two terms, in which one term (the "[[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]") is "affirmed" or "denied" of the other (the "[[subject (grammar)|subject]]"), and which is capable of [[truth]] or [[falsity]].
*The ''[[syllogism]]'' is an [[inference]] in which one [[proposition]] (the "[[Consequent|conclusion]]") follows of necessity from two others (the "[[premise]]s").

A proposition may be universal or particular, and it may be affirmative or negative. Traditionally, the four kinds of propositions are:
:* A-type: Universal and affirmative ("All philosophers are mortal")
:* I-type: Particular and affirmative ("Some philosophers are mortal")
:* E-type: Universal and negative ("All philosophers are not mortal")
:* O-type: Particular and negative ("Some philosophers are not mortal")
This was called the ''fourfold scheme'' of propositions (see [[Syllogism#Types|types of syllogism]] for an explanation of the letters A, I, E, and O in the traditional square). Aristotle's ''original'' [[square of opposition]], however, does not lack [[Syllogism#Existential import|existential import]].

In the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] article, "The Traditional Square of Opposition", Terence Parsons explains:
{{quote|One central concern of the Aristotelian tradition in logic is the theory of the [[categorical syllogism]]. This is the theory of two-premised arguments in which the premises and conclusion share three terms among them, with each proposition containing two of them. It is distinctive of this enterprise that everybody agrees on which syllogisms are valid. The theory of the syllogism partly constrains the interpretation of the forms. For example, it determines that the '''''A''''' form has existential import, at least if the '''''I''''' form does. For one of the valid patterns (Darapti) is:
:Every ''C'' is ''B''
:Every ''C'' is ''A''
:So, some ''A'' is ''B''

This is invalid if the '''''A''''' form lacks [[Syllogism#Existential import|existential import]], and valid if it has existential import. It is held to be valid, and so we know how the '''''A''''' form is to be interpreted. One then naturally asks about the '''''O''''' form; what do the syllogisms tell us about it? The answer is that they tell us nothing. This is because Aristotle did not discuss weakened forms of syllogisms, in which one concludes a particular proposition when one could already conclude the corresponding universal. For example, he does not mention the form:
:No ''C'' is ''B''
:Every ''A'' is ''C''
:So, some ''A'' is not ''B''

If people had thoughtfully taken sides for or against the validity of this form, that would clearly be relevant to the understanding of the O form. But the weakened forms were typically ignored...

One other piece of subject-matter bears on the [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the '''''O''''' form. People were interested in Aristotle's discussion of "infinite" negation, which is the use of negation to form a term from a term instead of a proposition from a proposition. In modern English we use "non" for this; we make "non-horse," which is true for exactly those things that are not horses. In medieval Latin "non" and "not" are the same word, and so the distinction required special discussion. It became common to use infinite negation, and logicians pondered its logic. Some writers in the twelfth century and [[13th century|thirteenth centuries]] adopted a principle called "conversion by contraposition". It states that

* 'Every ''S'' is ''P'' ' is equivalent to 'Every non-''P'' is non-''S'' '
* 'Some ''S'' is not ''P'' ' is equivalent to 'Some non-''P'' is not non-''S'' '

Unfortunately, this principle (which is not endorsed by Aristotle) conflicts with the idea that there may be empty or universal terms. For in the universal case it leads directly from the truth:
:Every man is a being

to the falsehood:
:Every non-being is a non-man

(which is false because the universal affirmative has existential import, and there are no non-beings). And in the particular case it leads from the truth (remember that the '''''O''''' form has no existential import):
:A chimera is not a man
To the falsehood:
:A non-man is not a non-chimera

These are [Jean] Buridan's examples, used in the fourteenth century to show the invalidity of [[Contraposition (traditional logic)|contraposition]]. Unfortunately, by Buridan's time the principle of contraposition had been advocated by a number of authors. The doctrine is already present in several twelfth century tracts, and it is endorsed in the thirteenth century by Peter of Spain, whose work was republished for centuries, by William Sherwood, and by Roger Bacon. By the fourteenth century, problems associated with contraposition seem to be well-known, and authors generally cite the principle and note that it is not valid, but that it becomes valid with an additional assumption of existence of things falling under the subject term. For example, Paul of Venice in his eclectic and widely published ''Logica Parva'' from the end of the fourteenth century gives the traditional square with simple conversion but rejects conversion by contraposition, essentially for Buridan's reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Terence |last=Parsons |editor=Edward N.

== Term ==

A term (Greek ''horos'') is the basic component of the proposition.  The original meaning of the ''horos'' (and also of the Latin ''terminus'') is "extreme" or "boundary". The two terms lie on the outside of the proposition, joined by the act of affirmation or denial.
For early modern [[logician]]s like Arnauld (whose ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' was the best-known text of his day), it is a psychological entity like an "idea" or "[[concept]]".  Mill considers it a word.  To assert "all Greeks are men" is not to say that the concept of Greeks is the concept of men, or that word "Greeks" is the word "men".  A [[proposition]] cannot be built from real things or ideas, but it is not just meaningless words either.

== Proposition ==

In term logic, a "proposition" is simply a ''form of language'': a particular kind of sentence, in which the subject and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] are combined, so as to assert something true or false.  It is not a thought, or an [[abstract entity]].  The word ''"propositio"'' is from the Latin, meaning the first premise of a [[syllogism]].  Aristotle uses the word premise (''protasis'') as a sentence affirming or denying one thing or another (''Posterior Analytics'' 1. 1 24a 16), so a [[premise]] is also a form of words.
However, as in modern philosophical logic, it means that which is asserted by the sentence.  Writers before [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], such as [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]], sometimes spoke of the "judgment" as something distinct from a sentence, but this is not quite the same.  As a further confusion the word "sentence" derives from the Latin, meaning an [[opinion]] or [[judgment]], and so is equivalent to "[[proposition]]".

The ''[[logical quality]]'' of a proposition is whether it is affirmative (the predicate is affirmed of the subject) or negative (the predicate is denied of the subject).  Thus ''every philosopher is mortal'' is affirmative, since the mortality of philosophers is affirmed universally, whereas ''no philosopher is mortal'' is negative by denying such mortality in particular.

The ''quantity'' of a proposition is whether it is universal (the predicate is affirmed or denied of all subjects or of "the whole") or particular (the predicate is affirmed or denied of some subject or a "part" thereof). In case where [[existential]] import is assumed, [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantification]] implies the existence of at least one subject, unless disclaimed.

== Singular terms ==

For Aristotle, the distinction between singular and universal is a fundamental [[metaphysical]] one, and not merely [[grammatical]].  A singular term for Aristotle is [[substance theory|primary substance]], which can only be [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]d of itself: (this) "Callias" or (this) "Socrates" are not predicable of any other thing, thus one does not say ''every Socrates'' one says ''every human'' (''De Int.'' 7; ''Meta.'' D9, 1018a4).  It may feature as a grammatical predicate, as in the sentence "the person coming this way is Callias".  But it is still a ''logical'' subject.

He contrasts universal (''katholou'')&lt;ref name="katholouLSJ"&gt;{{LSJ|kaqo/lou|καθόλου|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; secondary substance, genera, with primary substance, particular (''kath' hekaston'')&lt;ref name="katholouLSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(/kastos|καθ' ἕκαστον|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; specimens. The formal nature of universals, in so far as they can be generalized "always, or for the most part", is the subject matter of both scientific study and formal logic.&lt;ref&gt;They are mentioned briefly in the ''De Interpretatione''.  Afterwards, in the chapters of the ''Prior Analytics'' where Aristotle methodically sets out his theory of the syllogism, they are entirely ignored.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential feature of the [[syllogism]] is that, of the four terms in the two premises, one must occur twice.  Thus

:All Greeks are '''men'''
:All '''men''' are mortal.

The subject of one premise, must be the predicate of the other, and so it is necessary to eliminate from the logic any terms which cannot function both as subject and predicate, namely singular terms.

However, in a popular 17th century version of the syllogism, [[Port-Royal Logic]], singular terms were treated as universals:&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, Antoine and Nicole, Pierre; (1662) ''La logique, ou l'art de penser''. Part 2, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:All men are mortals
:All Socrates are men
:All Socrates are mortals

This is clearly awkward, a weakness exploited by Frege in his devastating attack on the system.

The famous syllogism "Socrates is a man ...", is frequently quoted as though from Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;For example: Kapp, ''Greek Foundations of Traditional Logic'', New York 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;17, Copleston ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'' Vol. I., p.&amp;nbsp;277, [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], ''A History of Western Philosophy'' London 1946 p.&amp;nbsp;218.&lt;/ref&gt; but fact, it is nowhere in the ''[[Organon]]''.  [[Sextus Empiricus]] in his ''Hyp. Pyrrh'' (Outlines of Pyrronism) ii. 164 first mentions the related syllogism "Socrates is a human being, Every human being is an animal, Therefore, Socrates is an animal."

== Influence on philosophy ==
The Aristotelian logical system had a formidable influence on the late-philosophy of the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. In the early 1970s, Lacan reworked Aristotle's term logic by way of Frege and Jacques Brunschwig to produce his four formulae of sexuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-aristotle.html|title=The Aristotelian Roots of Lacan's Formulas of Sexuation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these formulae retain the formal arrangement of the square of opposition, they seek to undermine the universals of both qualities by the 'existence without essence' of Lacan's particular negative proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lacan and Meaning: Sexuation, Discourse Theory, and Topology in the Age of Hermeneutics|last=Urban|first=William J.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1530345502|location=New York|pages=108–10, 132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline of term logic ==

Term logic began to decline in Europe during the [[Renaissance]], when logicians like [[Rodolphus Agricola]] Phrisius (1444–1485) and [[Petrus Ramus|Ramus]] (1515–1572) began to promote place logics. The logical tradition called [[Port-Royal Logic]], or sometimes "traditional logic", saw propositions as combinations of ideas rather than of terms, but otherwise followed many of the conventions of term logic. It remained influential, especially in England, until the 19th century. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] created a distinctive [[logical calculus]], but nearly all of his work on [[logic]] remained unpublished and unremarked until [[Louis Couturat]] went through the Leibniz ''[[Nachlass]]'' around 1900, publishing his pioneering studies in logic.

19th-century attempts to algebraize logic, such as the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] (1815–1864) and [[John Venn|Venn]] (1834–1923), typically yielded systems highly influenced by the term-logic tradition. The first [[predicate logic]] was that of [[Frege]]'s landmark ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879), little read before 1950, in part because of its eccentric notation. Modern [[predicate logic]] as we know it began in the 1880s with the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who influenced [[Peano]] (1858–1932) and even more, [[Ernst Schröder]] (1841–1902). It reached fruition in the hands of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. N. Whitehead]], whose ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13) made use of a variant of Peano's predicate logic.

Term logic also survived to some extent in traditional [[Roman Catholic]] education, especially in [[seminary|seminaries]]. Medieval Catholic [[theology]], especially the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], had a powerfully [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]] cast, and thus term logic became a part of Catholic theological reasoning. For example, Joyce's ''Principles of Logic'' (1908; 3rd edition 1949), written for use in Catholic seminaries, made no mention of [[Frege]] or of [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Copleston|Copleston]]'s ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revival ==

Some philosophers have complained that predicate logic:
* Is unnatural in a sense, in that its syntax does not follow the syntax of the sentences that figure in our everyday reasoning. It is, as Quine acknowledged, "[[Procrustean]]," employing an [[artificial language]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]] and [[Logical argument|argument]], [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]], and [[bound variable]].
* Suffers from theoretical problems, probably the most serious being [[empty name]]s and identity statements.

Even academic philosophers entirely in the mainstream, such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]], have written as follows:
:"I come to semantic investigations with a preference for ''homophonic'' theories; theories which try to take serious account of the syntactic and semantic devices which actually exist in the language ...I would prefer [such] a theory ... over a theory which is only able to deal with [sentences of the form "all A's are B's"] by "discovering" hidden [[logical constants]] ... The objection would not be that such [Fregean] truth conditions are not correct, but that, in a sense which we would all dearly love to have more exactly explained, the syntactic shape of the sentence is treated as so much misleading surface structure"  (Evans 1977)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whitehead Research Project''' (WRP) is dedicated to the research of, and scholarship on, the texts, philosophy, and life of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. It explores and analyzes the relevance of Whitehead's thought in dialogue with contemporary philosophies in order to unfold his [[philosophy of organism]] and its consequences for our time and in relation to emerging philosophical thought. Of particular interest is the investigation into the emergence of Whitehead's philosophy in the context of British and American pragmatism, its complicated relation to [[Continental philosophy]] and the analytic tradition, the relevance of his thought in the discourse of post-modern paradigms of [[deconstruction]] and [[post-structuralism]], and its creative impulse for developing process philosophies. Additionally, following Whitehead's own inclination to reach beyond European modes of thought, WRP seeks to extend its horizon of research by fostering similar conversations with strains of Indian and East Asian thought, thereby exhibiting de facto mutual influence–e.g., with the [[Kyoto School]] of Buddhist philosophy.

==History==
The WRP was conceived and founded in 2005 by [[Roland Faber]], who serves as its executive director. In February 2005, Faber proposed and installed WRP as a project of the [[Center for Process Studies]], a faculty research center of the [[Claremont School of Theology]] since 1973 and of which Faber is the executive director. In March 2005, the goal of creating a fully integrated online Whitehead research interface was established as a long-term, strategic aim of WRP. The official inauguration of WRP followed in December 2005 with its first international conference, "Event and Decision", on Badiou, Deleuze, and Whitehead. In March 2006, Faber invited [[Brian G. Henning]] to serve as the WRP's Director of Research. In July 2006, the creation of the WRP's International Board of Academic Advisors signaled the completion of the first phase of the genesis of WRP.

In July 2009, the WRP announced the creation of the [[Whitehead Research Interface]], also known as EVE (in honor of Whitehead's beloved wife, Evelyn). Once implemented, EVE will revolutionize the study of Whitehead's works by providing open access to the most complete electronic library of Whiteheadian scholarship in the world, some parts of which have never been made available to scholars.

In 2009, WRP founded [[Contemporary Whitehead Studies]] (CWS), an interdisciplinary book series that publishes manuscripts from scholars with contemporary and innovative approaches to Whitehead studies. By publishing innovative and adventurous approaches to Whitehead’s philosophy that engage with the problems, promise, and ideas of the twenty-first century, Contemporary Whitehead Studies creates a vital and dynamic space for scholarly engagement.

In September 2010, the WRP announced the inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead, a long-term initiative of the WRP that will, for the first time, make available the complete published and unpublished writings of Alfred North Whitehead in a single, critical edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whiteheadresearch.org/occasions/news/2010-09-11-Inauguration_of_CEW.shtml |title=Whitehead Research Project: News: Inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead |website=Whiteheadresearch.org |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Critical Edition of Whitehead is led by General Editor George R. Lucas, Jr. and Executive Editor Brian G. Henning.
