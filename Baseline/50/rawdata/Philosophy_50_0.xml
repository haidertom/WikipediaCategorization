'''16th-century philosophy''' is generally regarded as the later part of [[Renaissance philosophy]].

Early 16th-century philosophy is often called the '''High Renaissance''' and is considered to succeed the [[Renaissance philosophy]] era and precede the [[Age of Rationalism]].  Notable philosophers from the time period include [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and [[Michel de Montaigne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Philosophy: Essential Readings with Commentary'', edited by [[Aloysius Martinich|A.

Charges of ahistoricism are frequently critical, implying that the subject is historically inaccurate or ignorant (for example, an ''ahistorical'' attitude).  It can also describe a person's failure to frame an argument or issue in a historical context or to disregard historical fact or implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pepper|first=David|title=Eco-socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|pages=143–144|isbn=978-0-415-09719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of that would be films including [[dinosaur]]s and prehistoric human beings living side by side, but they were, in reality, millions of years apart.

The term can also describe a view that history has no relevance or importance in the decision making of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defineonline.com/Definition.aspx?Word=ahistoricism |title=ahistoricism |publisher=Define Online |accessdate=2008-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some academic contexts, ahistoricism is the accepted norm. For example, the [[history of science]] is generally considered a discipline that is quite separate and not directly important to research science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooday|first=Graeme|title=Does Science Education Need the History of Science?|url=http://lynch.faculty.asu.edu/pub/reprints/gooday2008.pdf|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|publisher=[[History of Science Society]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, some criticism has arisen because "the dominant school of philosophy in the English speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]]... has been trenchantly ahistorical, and indeed anti-historical". However, few view that to be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akehursta|first=Thomas|title=Writing history for the ahistorical: Analytic philosophy and its past|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2008.09.002|publisher=History of European Ideas|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Who is Thomas Akehursta (the author in the citation) and why is his opinion on this subject relevant?|date=February 2016}}

A more abstract definition of ahistoricism is simply independence from time: removed from history.
An example is the idea that some concepts are not governed by what is learned or has happened, but they come from an ahistoric power that is independent of what has gone before.

'''Apophantic''' ({{lang-el|ἀποφαντικός}}, "declaratory", from ἀποφαίνειν ''apophainein'', "to show, to make known") is a term [[Aristotle]] coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a [[logical proposition]] or phenomenon. It was adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] as part of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defines it as "the logic of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm5.html "One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence "All [[penguins]] are [[birds]]," and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence "All [[bachelors]] are unhappy." In the first proposition, the subject is ''penguins'' and the predicate is ''birds'', and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should [[Logical truth|necessarily]] be put. In the second proposition, the subject is ''bachelors'' and the predicate is ''unhappy''.  This is a subjective, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies "All penguins are birds" as more truthful than "All bachelors are unhappy." One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

The concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as ''jâzim'', or 'truth-apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ "Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9058">The '''argument from a proper basis''' is an [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] related to [[fideism]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] argued that belief in God is a properly [[basic belief]], and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Origins.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225232043/http://origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alvin Plantinga==

The best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and, owing to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "Proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://sites.google.com/site/filosofiariformata/descrizioni-di-scuole-di-pensiero-e-autori/epistemologia-riformata "''L'epistemologia riformata'' (Plantinga)"], article on ''Philosophia Reformata''. {{it icon}} Accessed 3 May 2016
&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[William Alston]], and [[Alvin Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls "warrant"—what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book of his three book philosophical series, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that [[Evolution (term) | evolution]] (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation, etc.{{huh?|date=January 2017}} can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

==Objections==

===The Great Pumpkin Objection===

The best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as '[[The Great Pumpkin]] Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', and described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that [[the Great Pumpkin]] returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rebuttal====

Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for "proper basicality" propounded by [[Foundationalism#Classical foundationalism|classical foundationalism]] (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector "knows" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

'''Casualism''' is the philosophical view that the universe, its creation and development is solely based on [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/casualism "Casualism"], Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be traced back to [[Epicurus]] (341 BCE – 270 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/1533.html|title=Kirchner: Kasualismus|website=Textlog.de|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however most of the original sources dealing with the concept have been lost and most material today is based on [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s  work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (c. 3rd century CE), and copies plus developments by [[Titus Lucretius Carus|Lucretius]] (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE) and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] (3 January 106 BCE – 7 December 43 BCE).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ "Epicurus"], Plato.Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualism assumes the universe came into existence as a random event, and was not created by any omnipotent entity. Followers have therefore often been accused of [[atheism]]. Casualism has certain atheistic traits, but none of the ancient philosophers denied the existence of gods.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus postulates that the gods simply stay out of the day-to-day running of the universe and are not even aware of the existence of man.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; The philosophy is based on observations of well known natural phenomena, such as ocean waves or the random fall of rain drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/785?msg=welcome_stranger|title=On the Nature of Things by Titus Lucretius Carus|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2018|website=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casualism is the concept of randomness as a philosophy.

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.

In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Cratylism''' as a [[philosophical theory]] reflects the teachings of the Athenian [[Cratylus]] ({{lang-grc|Κρατύλος}}, also transliterated as Kratylos), fl. mid to late 5th century BCE. Cratylus is more popularly known as [[Socrates]]' antagonist in [[Plato]]'s dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scissors of Meter: Grammetrics and Reading|last=Wesling|first=Donald|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0472107151|location=Ann Arbor|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaguely [[exegesis|exegetical]], Cratylism holds that the fluid nature of [[idea]]s, [[word]]s, and [[communication]]s leaves them fundamentally baseless, and possibly unable to support [[logic]] and [[reason]]. It is distinguished from linguisticity by the problematic status of style - that in a natural [[language]], where a perfect connection is found between word and things, variations of style are no longer conceivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and the Renewal of Society in Walt Whitman, Laura (Riding) Jackson, and Charles Olson: The American Cratylus|last=Billitteri|first=Carla|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=9781349375240|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gérard Genette|Gerard Genette]] divided the theory into primary and secondary Cratylism. The former is said to involve a general attempt to establish a motivated link between the signifier and the signified by inventing emotional values for certain sounds while the latter admits that language has fallen and that the signifier enjoys an arbitrary relation to the signified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assimilation/generation/resurrection: Contrapuntal Readings in the Poetry of José Lezama Lima|last=Heller|first=Ben|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=1997|isbn=0838753477|location=Lewisburg|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cratylism reaches similar conclusions about the nature of reality and communication that [[Taoism]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] also confronted: how can a mind in flux, in a flowing world, hold on to any solid "truth" and convey it to another mind?

A fellow-Greek sophist, [[Gorgias]], expressed an equally ironic ''cul de sac'' conclusion about the nature of human [[epistemology|epistemological]] understanding: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Nothing exists. Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it; and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], ''Greek Philosophy'' (1914), §96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5369">In [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], '''culturalism (new humanism''' or '''Znaniecki's humanism''') is the central importance of culture as an organizing force in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-214"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187" /&gt; It was originally coined by the Polish-American philosopher and sociologist [[Florian Znaniecki]] in his book ''[[Cultural Reality]]'' (1919) in English and later translated into Polish as ''kulturalizm''.  Znaniecki had introduced a similar concept in earlier Polish language publications which he described as ''humanism'' (''humanizm'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Znaniecki's culturalism was based on philosophies and theories of [[Matthew Arnold]] ([[Culture and Anarchy]]), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]), [[Henri Bergson]] ([[creative evolutionism]]), [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] ([[philosophy of life]]), [[William James]], [[John Dewey]]  ([[pragmatism]]) and [[Ferdinand C. Schiller]] ([[humanism]]).&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-51"/&gt;

Znaniecki was critical of a number of then-prevalent philosophical viewpoints: [[intellectualism]],&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[idealism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Kawecki|chapter=Heroism and Intimacy of Post-modern Morality|editor1=Bo Stråth|editor2=Nina Witoszek|title=The Postmodern Challenge: Perspectives East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2FeRqCaOgoC&amp;pg=PA129|year=1999|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0755-0|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophical realism|realism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt; [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; He was also critical of [[irrationalism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
In response to these criticisms, Znaniecki proposed a new theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"&gt;Sztompka (2002), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; His "culturalism" was an [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] approach aiming to eliminate dualisms such as the belief that nature and culture are opposite realities.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;

This approach allowed him to "define [[social phenomena]] in cultural terms".&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"/&gt; Znaniecki was arguing for the importance of [[culture]], noting that our culture shapes our view of the world and our thinking.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-187-188"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Znaniecki notes that while the world is composed of physical artifacts, we are not really capable of studying the physical world other than through the lenses of culture.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-189"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the fundamental aspects of the philosophy of culturalism are two categories: value and action.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt; [[Elżbieta Hałas]], who calls it an "antithesis to the intellectual dogmas of naturalism", identifies the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;
* "The subject-object dualism must be overcome and thought should be united with reality."
* "Reality is not an absolute order but changes in a creative evolution."
* "All images of the world are relative."
* "It is false to oppose nature and culture or to subordinate culture to nature."
* "Value is the most general category of the description of reality."

Znaniecki's philosophy of culturalism laid the foundation for his larger theoretical system, based around another concept of his, "[[humanistic coefficient]]."&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-55"&gt;Hałas (2010), pp. 55, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Through originally a philosophical concept,&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; culturalism was further developed by Znaniecki to inform his sociological theories.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-51"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Znaniecki's culturalism influenced modern sociological views of [[antipositivism]] and [[antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalism]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"&gt;Sztompka (2002), p. 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensivism''' is a philosophical standpoint related in spirit to the [[Non-aggression principle]]. It is also a midway point between other combat-based philosophies, that of [[Just War]] and [[Pacifism]]. 

The standpoint of Defensivism is that only Defensive actions are moral. You may move to someone's aid as long as they are in immediate danger, or protect yourself from immediate harm. 

To a country, it holds that a military force may never leave its home country's own borders except to move to the aid of someone else (and in such a situation, that they may only protect sites from harm that they are specifically invited to, with no aggressive action taken whatsoever). 

Any form of preemptive strike, any type of capture, revenge, or any situation where one would fire the first actual shot or throw the first actual blow is against the Defensivist standpoint. Also, any form of combative action must cease the moment the opposition stops fighting, withdraws, gives up, or ceases aggressive action. 

Generally, Defensivism only allows the taking of life when the life that would be taken is actively threatening another life.

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">'''Franz August Schmölders''' (28 November 1809 in [[Rhede]], [[Münsterland]] &amp;ndash; 21 February 1880 in [[Breslau]]) was a German orientalist. His focus was the Arabic language and literature.

==Education==
Schmölders studied from 1830 on philosophy and theology at the [[University of Bonn]]. Under the influence of professors Christian August Brandis, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Freytag, Christian Lassen and August Wilhelm Schlegel, he soon concentrated on the oriental, especially Arabic philosophy. He learned to Hebrew, Arabic, Avestan, Persian Syriac and Sanskrit.

During his studies Schmölders dealt especially with the Arabic translations of the writings of Aristotle. In 1835, he won with a text edition of the works of the Indian philosopher Bhartrihari the price of the Faculty of Arts. On 22 July 1836 he was a Dr. phil. PhD.

A scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowed Schmölders after studying one-half-year stay in Paris, where he deepened his studies. He attended lectures by the great French Arabist [[silvestre de Sacy]], [[Joseph Toussaint Reinaud]] (1795-1867) and [[Pierre Amédée Jaubert]]. During his time in Paris he wrote his first book in French, in which he discussed the history of philosophy among the Arabs. It was published in 1842 by the publisher Firmin Didot. Shortly thereafter came Schmölders back to Bonn and performed his habilitation there.

== University career ==
On 22 December 1842 Schmölders held his inaugural lecture at the [[University of Bonn]]. As a lecturer, he was able to receive a steady income. The Prussian Minister Johann Albrecht Friedrich Eichhorn supported him with scholarships. After only one and a half years (1844) Schmölders became an Associate Professor of Oriental Languages and Literatures at the University of Breslau. He followed this calling on 29 June 1844.

In Breslau, Schmölders spent 16 years as university scholar and as a teacher. He provided part-time lesssons in Hebrew and French  at Matthew Gymnasium and taught with official permission also an English course, in which he tutored gifted students. On 1 May 1846 he became a full member in the German Oriental Society.

After the death of his older colleague Georg Heinrich Bernstein (1860) Schmölders received on 10 October's full professor of Oriental Studies. Thus he was able to quit his teaching at the high school. He worked for twenty years as a professor at the University and received during this time many honors at home and abroad.

== Further activities and heritage ==
Because of his language skills - he mastered 22 languages - Schmölders was in high demand outside the university. As a member of the Scientific Examination committee, he took exams in English and French. He worked as a sworn interpreter in court, e.g. the royal Appellate. His many obligations, his keen interest in teaching and an abdominal illness prevented him since the 1860s from further publications. His grandson [[Günter Schmölders]] became professor for economics in Breslau and Cologne, his grand-granddaughter [[Claudia Schmölders]] an author and cultural scholar in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schmoelders-stiftung.de/guenter-schmoelders/|title=Günter Schmölders – Schmölders Stiftung|website=www.schmoelders-stiftung.de|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günter, Schmölders: Gut durchgekommen?“ Lebenserinnerungen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27512">'''Free will in antiquity''' was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern [[free will]] debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as [[determinism|determinist]], [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]], and [[compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien, ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy''; Timothy O'Keefe, ''Epicurus on Freedom'', R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate '', David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', Richard Sorabji, "Necessity, Cause, and Blame "&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical "agent-causal" libertarianism, include [[Democritus]] (460–370), [[Aristotle]] (384–322), [[Epicurus]] (341–270), [[Chrysippus]] (280–207), and [[Carneades]] (214–129).

==Pre-Socratic thought==
Early religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by superhuman gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.

The first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (ἀιτία) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers (''physiologoi''). The reasons or rules (λόγοι) behind the physical (φύσις) world became the ideal "laws" governing material phenomena. [[Anaximander]] (610-546) coined the term physis (φύσις) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (κόσμος), as organized nature, and logos (λόγος), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (νόμος). [[Heraclitus]] (535–475) claimed that everything changes ("you can't step twice into the same river") but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (νοῦς) of man. These ''physiologoi'' transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it.

==Democritus and Leucippus==
The materialist philosophers [[Democritus]] and his mentor [[Leucippus]] were the first [[determinism|determinists]]. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    By convention (nomos) color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and a void.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    νόμῳ χροιή, νόμῳ γλυκύ, νόμῳ πικρόν, ἑτεῇ δ’ ἄτομα καὶ κενόν&lt;ref&gt;Diels Kranz, fragment B125&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democritus wanted to wrest control of man's fate from arbitrary gods and make us more responsible for our actions. But ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, [[physical determinism]] and [[logical truth|logical necessity]], which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.

Leucippus dogmatically declared an absolute necessity which left no room in the cosmos for chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Nothing occurs at random (maten), but everything for a reason (logos) and by necessity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    οὐδὲν χρῆμα μάτην γίνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 – from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequence is a world with but one possible future, completely determined by its past.

==Socrates==
In Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Bust White Background Transparent.png|thumb|right|Aristotle]]

Michael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will.&lt;ref&gt; http://philpapers.org/archive/BOB_FW.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ἀιτία, which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.
Then, in his ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle also said there were "accidents" caused by "chance (τυχή)". In his ''Physics'', he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes.

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book VI, 1027a29&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event – a "starting point" or "fresh start" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (ἀρχή) – whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused.

Whether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its generation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' Book VI 1027b12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions "depend on us" (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).

[[Richard Sorabji]]'s 1980 ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'' surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of [[future contingents]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the "problem" of free will vis-a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so failed to cope with it. Indeed, the problem was not discovered until Hellenistic times, perhaps by Epicurus, who was over forty years junior to Aristotle, and who reached Athens just too late to hear his lectures. In Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that he knew of no such theory. His inevitable failure to see the threat to voluntariness is all the more regrettable in that he himself entertained a deterministic account of actions, which exacerbated the problem of how any could be voluntary. I shall argue that this account misrepresents the situation&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Epicurus==
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|right|Epicurus]]
It is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (''[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]]''), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a ''tertium quid'', beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond chance. His ''tertium quid'' is agent autonomy, what is "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...some things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ’ ἡμᾶς).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.&lt;ref&gt;Epicurus, ''Letter to Menoeceus'', §133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lucretius]] (1st century [[BCE]]), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (''libera'') in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (''voluntas'') wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, [[Pamela Huby]] suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the "freewill problem". Huby noted that there had been two main free will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, the third head of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Huby, "The First Discovery of the Freewill Problem", ''Philosophy'', 42 (1967), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 [[Susanne Bobzien]] challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the "free will problem".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In 1967 Epicurus was credited with the discovery of the problem of free will and determinism. Among the contestants were Aristotle and the early Stoics. Epicurus emerged victorious, because – so the argument went – Aristotle did not yet have the problem, and the Stoics inherited it from Epicurus. In the same year David Furley published his essay 'Aristotle and Epicurus on Voluntary Action', in which he argued that Epicurus' problem was not the free will problem. In the thirty-odd years since then, a lot has been published about Epicurus on freedom and determinism. But it has only rarely been questioned whether Epicurus, in one way or another, found himself face to face with some version of the free will problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls "two-sided freedom," because she believes that Epicurus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"assumed....a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly linked with causal indeterminism....To avoid misunderstandings, I should stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts – only that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free choice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. A. Long]] and [[David Sedley|D. N. Sedley]], however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Epicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be morally responsible for our actions at all. Thus posing the problem of determinism he becomes arguably the first philosopher to recognize the philosophical centrality of what we know as the Free Will Question. His strongly libertarian  approach to it can be usefully contrasted with the Stoics' acceptance of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Long and Sedley, ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'', section 20, "Free Will," p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question remains how random swerves can help to explain free action. In her 1992 book, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', [[Julia Annas]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...since swerves are random, it is hard to see how they help to explain free action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random swerve before every free action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random swerves cannot account for either of these features. This problem would be lessened if we could assume that swerves are very frequent, so that there is always likely to be one around before an action. However, if swerves are frequent, we face the problem that stones and trees ought to be enabled to act freely. And even in the case of humans random swerves would seem to produce, if anything, random actions; we still lack any clue as to how they could produce actions which are free.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One view, going back to the 19th century historian [[Carlo Giussani]], is that Epicurus' atomic swerves are involved directly in every case of human free action, not just somewhere in the past that breaks the causal chain of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;"The complete conception of the will according to Epicurus comprises two elements, a complex atomic movement which has the characteristic of spontaneity, that is, is withdrawn from the necessity of mechanical causation: and then the sensus, or self-consciousness in virtue of which the will, illuminated by previous movements of sensation, thought, and emotion, profits by the peculiar liberty or spontaneity of the atomic motions, to direct or not to direct these in a direction seen or selected." — Carlo Giussani, ''Studi Lucreziani'' 1896 (p. 126) (Cyril Bailey translation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Cyril Bailey]] agreed with Giussani that the atoms of the mind-soul provide a break in the continuity of atomic motions, otherwise actions would be necessitated. Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being "up to us" (πὰρ' ἡμάς).&lt;ref&gt;It is a commonplace to state that Epicurus, like his follower Lucretius, intended primarily to combat the 'myths' of the orthodox religion, to show by his demonstration of the unfailing laws of nature the falseness of the old notions of the arbitrary action of the gods and so to relieve humanity from the terrors of superstition. But it is sometimes forgotten that Epicurus viewed with almost greater horror the conception of irresistible 'destiny' or 'necessity', which is the logical outcome of the notion of natural law pressed to its conclusion. This conclusion had been accepted in its fulness by Democritus, but Epicurus conspicuously broke away from him: 'it were better to follow the myths about the gods than to become a slave to the "destiny" of the natural philosophers: for the former suggests a hope of placating the gods by worship, whereas the latter involves a necessity which knows no placation'. — Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey states that Epicurus did not ''identify'' freedom of the will with chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as chance and no more, is inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'' p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967 [[David Furley]] de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the "extreme" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this "traditional interpretation".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on ''voluntas'' and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms was supposed to do its work. Aristotle's criterion of the voluntary was a negative one: the source of the voluntary action is in the agent himself, in the sense that it cannot be traced back beyond or outside the agent himself. Lucretius says that voluntas must be saved from a succession of causes which can be traced back to infinity. All he needs to satisfy the Aristotelian criterion is a ''break in the succession of causes'', so that the source of an action cannot be traced back to something occurring before the birth of the agent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves ''voluntas'' from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of ''voluntas''.&lt;ref&gt;David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in his 1983 thesis, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", [[Don Paul Fowler]] defended the ancient claim that Epicurus proposed random swerves as directly causing our actions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I turn to the overall interpretation. Lucretius is arguing from the existence of ''voluntas'' to the existence of the ''clinamen''; nothing comes to be out of nothing, therefore ''voluntas'' must have a cause at the atomic level, viz. the ''clinamen''. The most natural interpretation of this is that every act of ''voluntas'' is caused by a swerve in the atoms of the animal's mind....There is a close causal, physical relationship between the macroscopic and the atomic. Furley, however, argued that the relationship between ''voluntas''  and the ''clinamen'' was very different; not every act of volition was accompanied by a swerve in the soul-atoms, but the ''clinamen'' was only an occasional event which broke the chain of causation between the σύστασις of our mind at birth and the 'engendered' state (τὸ ἀπογεγεννημένον) which determines our actions.Its role in Epicureanism is
merely to make a formal break with physical determinism, and it has no real effect on the outcome of particular actions. (p. 338).&lt;ref&gt;Don Fowler, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", Συζήτησισ: ''Studi sull'epicureismo greco e romano offerti a Marcello Gigante'', (Naples, 1983) 329–52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a 1999 ''Phronesis'' article, Purinton agreed with Fowler that random swerves directly cause volitions and actions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"since they do not make volition itself a fresh start of motion, and Sedley's view does not do justice to his atomism...It seems to me, therefore, that there is no good reason to reject the thesis that Epicurus held that swerves cause volitions from the bottom up. And there are a number of good reasons to accept it."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Purinton, "Epicurus on 'Free Volition' and the Atomic Swerve,'" ''Phronesis'', 44, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stoicism==
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoic school of philosophy]] that solidified the idea of natural laws controlling all things, including the mind. [[Zeno of Citium]], the original founder of Stoicism, had a simple but powerful idea of the causal chain compared to Aristotle. Zeno said that every event has a cause, and that cause necessitates the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is impossible that the cause be present yet that of which it is the cause not obtain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ἀδύνατον δ’ εἴναι τὸ μὲν αἴτιον παρεῖναι, οὖ δέ ἐστιν αἴτιον μὴ ὑπάρχειν.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chrysippus bust.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysippus]]
The major developer of Stoicism, [[Chrysippus]], took the edge off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, he wanted to strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.

Whereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a [[compatibilism|compatibilist]].

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus  (c. 280–207 BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow – otherwise an uncaused motion would occur.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (ἐφ΄ ἡμῖν), 'what depends on us', like the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alexander of Aphrodisias==
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 150–210), the most famous ancient commentator on Aristotle, wrote in the age of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics. He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for "free will" as did Latin (''liberum arbitrium'' or ''libera voluntas''). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what "depends on us" (in Greek ἐφ ἡμῖν).

Alexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander himself argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature.

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] described Alexander's ''De Fato'' as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμίν) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, translation and commentary ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

A '''heuristic argument''' is an [[argument]] that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown by experimental (especially [[trial-and-error]]) investigation to be a useful aid in learning, discovery and [[problem-solving]]. A widely used and important example of a [[heuristic]] argument is [[Occam's Razor]].

It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument, that relies on an analogy or on intuition, that allows one to achieve a result or approximation to be checked later with more rigor; otherwise the results are of doubt. It is used as a hypothesis or conjecture in an investigation. It can also be used as a mnemonic.&lt;ref name="BrodskyEllis1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Ellis|first2=John|last3=Karliner|first3=Marek|title=Chiral symmetry and the spin of the proton|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=206|issue=2|year=1988|pages=309–315|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(88)91511-0|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-4519.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

An '''instant''' is an [[infinitesimal]] moment in [[time]], a moment whose passage is instantaneous.

The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', where he wrote on [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. The philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29E9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129 |title=The structure of time |author=W. Newton-Smith |chapter=The Russellian construction of instants |page=129 |publisher=Routledge |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-7102-0389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a theoretical lower-bound unit of time called the [[Planck time]] has been proposed, that being the time required for [[light]] to travel a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Planck length]].&lt;ref name="gsu_hbase"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/planck.html | title = Big Bang models back to Planck time | publisher = [[Georgia State University]] | date = 19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Planck time is theorized to be the smallest time measurement that will ever be possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/P/Planck+Time |title=Planck Time |encyclopedia =COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher= Swinburne University}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. Within the framework of the laws of physics as they are understood today, for times less than one Planck time apart, one can neither measure nor detect any change. It is therefore physically impossible, with current technology, to determine if any action exists that causes a reaction in "an instant", rather than a reaction occurring after an interval of time too short to observe or measure.

{{As of|2016|November}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 850 zeptoseconds (850 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-measure-the-smallest-fragment-of-time-ever-witness-an-electron-escaping-an-atom|title=Scientists have measured the smallest fragment of time ever|last=|first=|date=2010-05-12|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The '''International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science''' ('''HOPOS''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[organization]] for promoting the study of the [[history]] of [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hopos.org&lt;/ref&gt; The society promotes exchange of ideas among scholars through meetings, journals, and online. It maintains an active email listserv, HOPOS-G.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/vt.edu/forum/#!forum/hopos-g&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science'' is published by [[The University of Chicago Press]]. The first issue appeared in 2011. The journal provides an outlet for interdisciplinary work that helps to explain the links among philosophy, science, and mathematics, along with the social, economic, and political context. The journal features articles, book reviews, and annually, an extensive essay review of the recent scholarship in a growing area of the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/hopos.html&lt;/ref&gt; The editor-in-chief is Rose-Mary Sargent of [[Merrimack College]].

HOPOS has held international meetings every two years since 1996. The first meeting was in Roanoke, Virginia, hosted by [[Virginia Tech]]. The 2016 meeting, HOPOS 2016, will take place at the [[University of Minnesota]], hosted by the University and by the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science.,&lt;ref&gt;http://hopos2016.umn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mcps.umn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous meetings have been held in Halifax, Budapest, Vancouver, Paris, San Francisco, Montréal, Vienna, and South Bend. An archive of meeting websites can be found on the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/hopos/conferences.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993-2010, the organization produced a newsletter. Archives can be found on the website of HOPOS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/hopos/newsletters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

HOPOS is a member organization of [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">An '''invincible error''' is, in [[Christian philosophy]], a normally [[sin|sinful action]] which is not considered sinful because it was committed through blameless ignorance that one's actions were harmful or otherwise prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm 'Error' in Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the stated philosophy, a sin occurs when a person knowingly commits an evil act, meaning that they must know both:
*that they are committing the act
*that the act is evil
If a person is ignorant of one of these two facts, then the type of ignorance becomes important. If the person is intentionally or willfully ignorant, this is known as ''[[vincible ignorance]]'', and the act is still considered a sin. If, however, the person is unintentionally ignorant of one of these two key facts, then they are considered ''invincibly'' ignorant, and have committed an invincible error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katapi.org.uk/MoralTH/ChV.htm Elements of Moral Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620050432/http://katapi.org.uk/MoralTH/ChV.htm |date=2006-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]]'s demonstration of the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion. It is the same demonstration that [[Oresme]] had made centuries earlier.]]

In the 14th-century, the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]] and French collaborators such as [[Nicole Oresme]] proved the '''mean speed theorem''', also known as the '''Merton rule''' of [[uniform acceleration]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Grant]], ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'' (1974) Vol. 1, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Merton mean speed theorem'''. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with [[speed|uniform speed]] whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |chapter=III. Medieval Contributions |pages=79–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Details==
Oresme essentially provided a geometrical verification for the generalized Merton Rule, which we would express today as &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_f)t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., distance traveled is equal to one half of the sum of the initial and final velocities, multiplied by the elapsed time), by finding the area of a [[trapezoid]].&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Edwards, Jr., ''The Historical Development of the Calculus'' (1979) pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay tablets used in [[Babylonian astronomy]] (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and [[Displacement (vector)|motion]] and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ossendrijver |first=Mathieu |date=29 Jan 2016 |title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full |journal=Science |publisher= |volume=351 |issue=6272 |pages=482–484 |doi=10.1126/science.aad8085 |access-date=29 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Sci...351..482O |pmid=26823423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of "[[Law of falling bodies|the law of falling bodies]]" — long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it. The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main [[kinematical]] properties of [[uniformly accelerated motion]]s, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

The theorem is a special case of the more general kinematics equations for uniform acceleration.

The '''Modern Greek Enlightenment''' ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}, ''Diafotismos'', "enlightenment," "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Origins==
{{further information|Ottoman Greece}}
The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Greek [[merchant]]s financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Intellectual Revival'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to 1821.  It was not by chance that on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] the most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Ioannina]], [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] (Izmir) and [[Ayvalik]], all major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritannicaB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Phanariotes===
The [[Phanariotes]] were a small caste of Greek families who took their collective name from the [[Phanar]] quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is still housed. They held various administrative posts within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the most important of which were those of [[hospodar]], or prince, of the [[Danubian principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Most hospodars acted as patrons of Greek culture, education, and printing. These academies attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was some contact with intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] central Europe. For the most part they supported the Ottoman system of government, too much to play a significant part in the emergence of the Greek national movement; however, their support of learning produced many highly educated Greek scholars who benefited from the cosmopolitan environment the Phanariotes cultivated in their principalities.&lt;ref name=BritannicaC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Transformation toward emancipation, The Phanariotes'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

This environment was in general a special attraction for young, ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to their national enlightenment. The Princely Academies of [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Bucharest]] and [[Princely Academy of Iaşi|Iasi]] also played a crucial role in this movement. Characteristically the authors of the ''[[Geographia Neoteriki]]'', one of the most remarkable works of that era, [[Daniel Philippidis]] and [[Grigorios Konstantas]], were both educated in this environment.&lt;ref name=Kopecek&gt;{{cite book |first=Michal |last=Kopeček |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |language=|year=2006|pages= 73–79|ref= |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA74 |publisher=Central European University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last=Sussex |first2= Eade|last2= John Christopher|title=Culture and nationalism in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe |language=|year=1985|page= 8|ref= |isbn=978-0-89357-146-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oMYPTZOCG8eAswbmse30DA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eQZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography%22&amp;q=%22Daniil+Philippidis+and+Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography+of+1791%2C+one+of+the+most+remarkable+works+of+the+%27Neo-Hellenic+Enlightenment%27%2C+%22#search_anchor |publisher=Slavica Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One effect was the creation of an [[Attic Greek|atticized]] form of Greek by linguistic purists, which was adopted as the official [[state language|language of the state]] and came to be known as ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified). This created [[diglossia]] in the Greek linguistic sphere, in which ''Katharevousa'' and the vernacular idiom known as [[Demotic Greek|''Dimotiki'']] were in conflict until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BritannicaA/&gt;

The transmission of Enlightenment ideas into Greek thought also influenced the development of a national consciousness. The publication of the journal [[Hermes o Logios]] encouraged the ideas of the Enlightenment. The journal's objective was to advance Greek science, philosophy and culture.  Two of the main figures of the Greek Enlightenment, [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]], encouraged Greek nationalists to pursue contemporary political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= M. Kitromilides |first= Paschalis | title=The Dialectic of Intolerance: Ideological Dimensions of Ethnic Conflict | publisher=Journal of the Hellnice Diaspora | year=1979 | editor= |url= http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/5243/Kitromilides_6_4.pdf;jsessionid=D85E79913BFF8FCAF6D4228BE8B3CEAC?sequence=1 | isbn=  | page =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek Enlightenment concerned not only language and the [[humanities]] but also the [[sciences]]. Some scholars such as [[Methodios Anthrakites]], [[Evgenios Voulgaris]], [[Athanasios Psalidas]], [[Balanos Vasilopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Darbaris]] had a background in [[Mathematics]] and the [[Physical Sciences]] and published scientific books into Greek for use in Greek schools. [[Rigas Feraios]] also published an Anthology of Physics.

'''Moore's paradox''' concerns the apparent absurdity involved in asserting a first-person present-tense sentence such as, "It's raining, but I don't believe that it is raining" or "It's raining but I believe that it is not raining." The first author to note this apparent absurdity was [[G. E. Moore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |chapter=Moore's Paradox |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Baldwin |title=G. E. Moore: Selected Writings |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |pages=207–212 |isbn=978-0-415-09853-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 'Moorean' sentences, as they have become known, are paradoxical in that while they appear absurd, they nevertheless:
# Can be true,
# Are (logically) consistent, and moreover
# Are not (obviously) [[contradiction]]s.
The term 'Moore's paradox' is attributed to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Philosophical Investigations |location= |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1953 |others=Section II.x |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who considered the paradox Moore's most important contribution to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Letters to Russell, Keynes and Moore |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=von Wright |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote about the paradox extensively in his later writings, which brought Moore's paradox the attention it would not have otherwise received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volume I |editor1-first=G. E. M. |editor1-last=Anscombe |editor2-first=G. H. |editor2-last=von Wright |others=Translated by G. E. M. Anscombe |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-631-12541-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's paradox has also been connected to many other of the well-known [[paradox#Logical paradox|logical paradoxes]] including, though not limited to, the [[liar paradox]], the [[knower paradox]], the [[unexpected hanging paradox]], and the [[preface paradox]].&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roy A. |last=Sorensen |year=1988 |title=Blindspots |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824981-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no generally accepted explanation of Moore's paradox in the philosophical literature. However, while Moore's paradox remains a philosophical curiosity, Moorean-type sentences are used by logicians, computer scientists, and those working in the [[artificial intelligence]] community as examples of cases in which a knowledge, belief, or information system is unsuccessful in updating its knowledge/belief/information store in light of new or novel information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendricks | first=Vincent F. | last2=Symons | first2=John | title=Where's the Bridge? Epistemology and Epistemic Logic | journal=Philosophical Studies | volume=128 | issue=1 | year=2006 | issn=0031-8116 | doi=10.1007/s11098-005-4060-0 | pages=137–167| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.3026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
Since [[Jaakko Hintikka]]'s seminal treatment of the problem,&lt;ref name="Hintikka"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jaakko |last=Hintikka |year=1962 |title=Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the Two Notions |location=Cornell, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become standard to present Moore's paradox by explaining why it is absurd to assert sentences that have the logical form:
"P and NOT(I believe that P)" or "P and I believe that NOT-P."
Philosophers nowadays refer to these, respectively, as the omissive and commissive versions of Moore's paradox.

Moore himself presented the problem in two ways.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |year=1991 |chapter=Russell's Theory of Descriptions |editor-first=P. A. |editor-last=Schilpp |title=The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell |series=The Library of Living Philosophers |volume=5 |location=La Salle, IL |publisher=Open Court Publishing |pages=177–225 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first more fundamental way of setting the problem up starts from the following three premises:
# It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
# I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
# It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

I can assert that it is raining at a particular time. I can assert that I don't believe that it is raining at a particular time. If I say both at the same time, I am saying or doing something absurd. But the content of what I say—the [[proposition]] the sentence expresses—is perfectly consistent: it may well be raining, and I may not believe it. So why cannot I assert that it is so?

Moore presents the problem in a second, distinct, way:
# It is not absurd to assert the past-tense counterpart, e.g. "It was raining, but I did not believe that it was raining."
# It is not absurd to assert the second- or third-person counterparts to Moore's sentences, e.g. "It is raining, but ''you'' do not believe that it is raining," or "Michael is dead, but ''they'' do not believe that he is."
# It is absurd to assert the present-tense "It is raining and I don't believe that it is raining."

I can assert that I ''was'' a certain way, e.g. believing it was raining when it wasn't, and that you, he, or they, ''are'' that way but not that I ''am'' that way.

Subsequent philosophers have further noted that there is also an apparent absurdity in asserting a first-person ''future-tense'' sentence such as "It will be raining, and I will believe that it is not raining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Luc |last=Bovens |year=1995 |title='P and I Will Believe that not-P': Diachronic Constraints on Rational Belief |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=104 |issue=416 |pages=737–760 |doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when it does not specify an exact time for when the belief is mistaken, the proposition will tend to be true at some point in the future - its negation would imply that "Every time I believe it's not raining, it will not be raining", which is unlikely since human beliefs are often mistaken.

Many philosophers—though by no means all—also hold that Moore's paradox arises not only at the level of [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|assertion]] but also at the level of [[belief]]. One who believes an instance of a Moorean sentence is tantamount to one who is subject to or engaging in [[self-deception]], at least on one standard way of describing it.

==Proposed explanations==
Philosophical interest in Moore's paradox, since Moore and Wittgenstein, has undergone a resurgence, starting with, though not limited to, [[Jaakko Hintikka]],&lt;ref name="Hintikka" /&gt; continuing with [[Roy Sorensen]],&lt;ref name="Sorensen"/&gt; [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=David |last=Rosenthal |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Consciousness |series=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=9 |title=AI, Connectionism and Philosophical Psychology |year=1995 |location=Atascadero, CA |publisher=Ridgeview |isbn=978-0-924922-73-2 |pages=313–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Shoemaker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sydney |last=Shoemaker |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Self-Knowledge |title=The First-Person Perspective and other essays |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-56871-5 |pages=74–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first publication, in 2007, of a collection of articles devoted to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Mitchell S. |editor1-last=Green |editor2-first=John N. |editor2-last=Williams |title=Moore's Paradox: New Essays on Belief, Rationality and the First-Person |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-928279-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several proposed constraints on a satisfactory explanation in the literature, including (though not limited to):
*It should explain the absurdity of both the omissive and the commissive versions.
*It should explain the absurdity of both asserting and believing Moore's sentences.
*It should preserve, and reveal the roots of, the intuition that contradiction (or something contradiction-like) is at the root of the absurdity.

The first two conditions have generally been the most challenged, while the third appears to be the ''least'' controversial. Some philosophers have claimed that there is, in fact, no problem in believing the content of Moore's sentences (e.g. David Rosenthal).  Others (e.g. Sydney Shoemaker) hold that an explanation of the problem at the level of belief will automatically provide us with an explanation of the absurdity at the level of assertion via the linking principle that what can reasonably be asserted is determined by what can reasonably be believed. Some have also denied (e.g. Rosenthal) that a satisfactory explanation to the problem need be uniform in explaining both the omissive AND commissive versions. Most of the explanations offered of Moore's paradox are united in holding that [[contradiction]] is at the heart of the absurdity.

One type of explanation at the level of assertion exploits the view that assertion implies or expresses [[belief]] in some way so that if someone asserts that ''p'' they imply or express the belief that ''p''. Several versions of this view exploit elements of [[speech act]] theory, which can be distinguished according to the particular explanation given of the link between assertion and belief. Whatever version of this view is preferred, whether cast in terms of the Gricean intentions (see [[Paul Grice]]) or in terms of the structure of Searlean illocutionary acts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Searle |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Daniel |last2=Vanderveken |title=Foundations of Illocutionary Logic |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-521-26324-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[speech act]]), it does not obviously apply to explaining the absurdity of the commissive version of Moore's paradox. To take one version of this type of explanation, if someone asserts ''p'' and conjoins it with the assertion (or denial) that he does not believe that ''p'', then he has in that very act contradicted himself, for in effect what the speaker says is: I believe that ''p'' and I do not believe that ''p''. The absurdity of asserting '''p'' &amp; I do not believe that ''p''' is thus revealed as being of a more familiar kind. Depending on one's view of the nature of contradiction, one might thus interpret a speaker of the omissive Moorean sentence as asserting everything (that is, asserting ''too'' much) or asserting nothing (that is, not asserting ''enough'').

An alternative view is that the assertion "I believe that ''p''" often (though '''not''' always) functions as an alternative way of asserting "''p''", so that the semantic content of the assertion "I believe that ''p''" is just ''p'': it functions as a statement about the world and not about anyone's state of mind. Accordingly, what someone asserts when they assert "''p'' and I believe that not-''p''" is just "''p'' and not-''p''" Asserting the commissive version of Moore's sentences is again assimilated to the more familiar (putative) impropriety of asserting a [[contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Kent |last=Linville |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Merrill |last2=Ring |title=Moore's Paradox Revisited |journal=Synthese |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=295–309 |doi=10.1007/BF00485405 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of belief, there are two main kinds of explanation. The first, much more popular one, agrees with those at the level of assertion that contradiction is at the heart of the absurdity. The contradiction is revealed in various ways, some using the resources of [[doxastic logic]] (e.g. Hintikka), others (e.g. Sorensen) principles of [[rational belief]] maintenance and formation, while still others appeal to our putative capacity for [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and the [[first-person authority]] (e.g. Shoemaker) we have over our states of mind.

Another alternative view, due to [[Richard Moran (philosopher)|Richard Moran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Moran |title=Authority &amp; Estrangement: An Essay on Self-knowledge |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-691-08944-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; views the existence of Moore's paradox as symptomatic of creatures who are capable of self-knowledge, capable of thinking ''for'' themselves from a deliberative point of view, as well as ''about'' themselves from a theoretical point of view. On this view, anyone who asserted or believed one of Moore's sentences would be subject to a loss of self-knowledge—in particular, would be one who, with respect to a particular 'object', broadly construed, e.g. person, apple, the way of the world, would be in a situation which violates, what Moran calls, the Transparency Condition: if I want to know what I think about X, then I consider/think about nothing but X itself. Moran's view seems to be that what makes Moore's paradox so distinctive is not some contradictory-like phenomenon (or at least not in the sense that most commentators on the problem have construed it), whether it be located at the level of belief or that of assertion. Rather, that the very possibility of Moore's paradox is a consequence of our status as agents (albeit finite and resource-limited ones) who are capable of knowing (and changing) their own minds.

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

The '''pantheism controversy''' ({{lang-de|Pantheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1785–1789 which had an effect throughout Europe.

==History==
A conversation between the German philosopher [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] and the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1780 led Jacobi to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s works. Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save [[Spinozism]].

Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] group, led by [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and [[pantheism]]. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[antinomy|antinomies]] in thought.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a [[pietist]], and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term ''Glaube'' ([[German (language)|German]]: "belief, faith"). 

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299190803|pages=12-13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of [[nihilism]] and claims that [[God is dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobi's next important work, ''[[David Hume]] Über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''Glaube'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the [[critical philosophy]], and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
*the unity of all that exists;
*the regularity of all that happens; and
*the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb| The paradox of fiction asks why we experience strong emotions when, for example,  we are watching [[Hamlet]] on stage while at the same time knowing that it is not really Hamlet but merely an [[actor]].]]

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

[[Image:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl Popper]]]]
In [[philosophy]] and [[models of scientific inquiry]], '''postpositivism''' (also called '''''postempiricism''''') is a [[metatheoretical]] stance that critiques and amends [[positivism]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Mats|article=Positivism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy|date=2016|isbn=9781118766804|page=1–5|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect248/full|ref=IntEncycCTP}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists accept that theories, background, knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed.&lt;ref name="Robson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Colin|title=Real World Research. A Resource for Social Scientists and Practitioner-Researchers (Second Edition)|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|isbn=0-631-21305-8|pages=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpositivists pursue objectivity by recognizing the possible effects of biases.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Katherine|title=Communication theories : perspectives, processes, and contexts|date=2007|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=9787301124314|page=35-45|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011" /&gt; While positivists emphasize quantitative methods, postpositivists consider both quantitative and qualitative methods to be valid approaches&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Lindlof|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative communication research methods|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412974738|page=5-13|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"/&gt;, but rather upon human ''[[conjectural|conjectures]]''. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are ''warranted'', or more specifically, justified by a set of ''[[Theory of justification|warrant]]s'', which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation.  However, postpositivism is not a form of [[relativism]], and generally retains the idea of [[objective truth]].

===Ontology===
Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; and probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt; Postpositivists also draw from [[social constructionism]] in forming their understanding and definition of reality.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

===Axiology===
While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their [[axiology]] (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

==History==
Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by [[Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Auguste Comte]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016" /&gt;, and [[logical positivism]], which is most strongly associated with the [[Vienna Circle]], which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

One of the first thinkers to criticize [[logical positivism]] was [[Karl Popper|Sir Karl Popper]]. He advanced [[Falsifiability|falsification]] in lieu of the logical positivist idea of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s idea of [[paradigm shift]]s offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole [[worldview]]s that must occasionally shift in response to evidence.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; 

Postpositivism is not a rejection of the [[scientific method]], but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques.  It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of [[objective truth]], and the use of [[experiment]]al [[methodology]]. The work of philosophers [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ian Hacking]] are representative of these ideas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Postpositivism of this type is described in [[social science]] guides to research methods.&lt;ref name="soc_rsch_Trochim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Social Research Methods Knowledge Base|url=https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb|website=socialresearchmethods.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Structure and Nature of a Postpositivist Theory==

Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic "units" or ideas and topics of interest, "laws of interactions" among the units, and a description of the "boundaries" for the theory.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; A postpositivist theory also includes "empirical indicators" to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is "[[Accuracy and precision|accurate]]", "[[Consistency|consistent]]", "has broad scope", "[[Occam's razor|parsimonious]]", and "fruitful".&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9437">[[File:John Dewey in 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Pragmatic ethics was discussed by [[John Dewey]] (pictured)]] '''Pragmatic ethics''' is a theory of [[normative ethics|normative]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[ethics]]. Ethical pragmatists such as [[John Dewey]] believe that some societies have progressed [[morality|morally]] in much the way they have attained progress in [[science]]. Scientists can pursue [[inquiry]] into the [[truth]] of a [[hypothesis]] and [[belief|accept]] the hypothesis, in the sense that they act as though the hypothesis were true; nonetheless, they think that future generations can advance science, and thus future generations can refine or replace (at least some of) their accepted hypotheses. Similarly, ethical pragmatists think that norms, principles, and moral criteria are likely to be improved as a result of [[inquiry]].

==Contrast with other normative theories&lt;!--'Peircean realism' redirects here--&gt;==
Much as it is appropriate for scientists to act as though a hypothesis were true despite expecting future inquiry to supplant it, ethical pragmatists acknowledge that it can be appropriate to practice a variety of other normative approaches (e.g. [[consequentialism]], [[deontological ethics]], and [[virtue ethics]]), yet acknowledge the need for mechanisms which allow society to advance beyond such approaches, a freedom for discourse which does not take any such theory as assumed.&lt;ref name=Liszka&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2005/Liszka.htm |title= What Is Pragmatic Ethics? |first= James |last= Liszka | accessdate= 2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aimed at [[social innovation]], the ''practice'' of pragmatic ethics supplements the practice of other normative approaches with what [[John Stuart Mill]] called "experiments of living".&lt;ref name=Mill1863&gt;{{harvtxt|Mill|1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatic ethics also differs from other normative approaches ''theoretically'', according to {{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}:&lt;ref name="Lafollette2000"/&gt;

# It focuses on society, rather than on lone individuals, as the entity which achieves morality.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dewey's words, "all conduct is ... social." &lt;ref name=Dewey1922&gt;{{harvtxt| Dewey|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It does not hold any known moral criteria as beyond potential for revision.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; Pragmatic ethics may be misunderstood as [[Moral relativism|relativist]], as failing to be objective, but that is like suggesting that science fails to be objective. Ethical pragmatists, like scientists, can maintain that their endeavor is objective on the grounds that it converges towards something objective (a thesis called '''Peircean realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Almeder1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Almeder |first= R. |year=1983 |title= Scientific Progress and Peircean Utopian Realism |journal= Erkenntnis |issue= 20 |pages= 253–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It allows that a moral judgment may be appropriate in one age of a given society, even though it will cease to be appropriate after that society progresses (or may already be inappropriate in another society).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; For example, the writings of [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|on slavery]] framed slavery as ultimately immoral, yet temporarily moral until America was ready for abolition.&lt;ref name="HEI"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bateman | first = Newton |author2=Paul Selby |author3=Frances M. Shonkwiler |author4=Henry L Fowkes  | title = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois | publisher = Munsell Publishing Company | year = 1908 | location = Chicago, IL | page = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to pragmatism==
Establishing that this normative theory entails [[pragmatism]] (or vice versa) remains an open challenge. The ''Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory'' refers to this theory as pragmatic and finds it in the writings of [[John Dewey]] (a pragmatist). However, it also finds key concepts in the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]],&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; and we can see at least some of its distinguishing characteristics in the concept of [[social gadfly]] attributed to [[Socrates]] in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.Apol.30e&amp;lang=original | title = Apology 30e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Pragmatic ethics has been criticized as conflating [[descriptive ethics]]  with [[normative ethics]], as describing the way people ''do'' make moral judgments rather than the way they ''should'' make them. While some ethical pragmatists may have questioned the distinction between normative and descriptive truth, the theory of pragmatic ethics itself does not conflate them any more than science conflates truth about its subject matter with current opinion about it.&lt;ref name=Liszka/&gt;

==Moral ecology==
Moral ecology is a variation of pragmatic ethics which additionally supposes that morality evolves like an [[ecosystem]], and ethical practice should therefore include strategies analogous to those of [[ecosystem management]] (e.g. protecting a degree of moral diversity). The term "moral ecology" has been used since at least 1985 to imply a [[symbiosis]] whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches.&lt;ref name=Bellah1985&gt;{{harvtxt|Bellah|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Hertzke1998&gt;{{harvtxt| Hertzke |1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Dean, current scientific evidence confirms that humans do take diverse approaches to morality, and such [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] gives humanity [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] against a wider range of situations and environments (which makes moral diversity a natural consequence of [[frequency-dependent selection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:12763/SOURCE02?view=true |last1 = Dean | first1 = Tim |title= Evolution &amp; Moral Ecology | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rebecca Roache''' is a British [[philosopher]] and Senior Lecturer at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], known for her work on the philosophy of language, practical ethics and philosophy of mind&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rebecca-roache(59a8d9fa-c44f-4e78-9626-a78500c9013d).html]" Departmental website&lt;/ref&gt;. She is particularly noted for her work on swearing, which has featured in various media, such as the BBC&lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39082467]” BBC article on swearing, accessed 27 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Biography ==

Roache received her BA in philosophy at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1996, and her MA in philosophy at the same university in 1997, where she worked among others closely with [[Robin Le Poidevin]]. She then took an MPhil (1999) and a DPhil (2002) at the [[University of Cambridge]], St. John’s College, with [[Jane Heal]] and [[D.H. Mellor]] as dissertation advisers&lt;ref&gt; “[https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.rebecca.roache]” Biography of Rebecca Roache, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. After completing her DPhil, she worked in various projects at the University of Oxford from 2006 onwards. She is currently Senior Lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rebecca-roache(59a8d9fa-c44f-4e78-9626-a78500c9013d).html]" Departmental website&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2013 to 2018, she was Associate Editor for the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]]. 

== Notable philosophical views ==

Roache’s theory of swearing &lt;ref&gt; “[https://aeon.co/essays/where-does-swearing-get-its-power-and-how-should-we-use-it]” Roache, Rebecca. 2018. Naughty words. Aeon Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; examines why swearwords (including non-slurs and non-religious swearwords) are so powerful. She proposes that swearwords have a unique linguistic role, coupled to a unique emotional role.  According to Roache, swearing obtains its power because of speaker inferences: when someone swears, she knows her audience will find it offensive, and the swearer knows the audience knows she knows that the audience will find it offensive, and so on, a process termed ''offence escalation''. Speakers and listeners who belong to the same cultural and linguistic community will likely find similar things offensive, which explains why some expressions (disrespecting social hierarchy, sexual taboos, mention of bodily fluids etc) tend to cross-culturally recur as swearwords &lt;ref&gt; “[http://podbay.fm/show/257042117/e/1427640203?autostart=1]” Roache, Rebecca. 2018. Podcast on swearing. Philosophy Bites Podcast.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Roache is also noted for a blogpost where she said she unfriended people who voted for the Conservatives at the 2015 General Election. She argued that “Openly supporting a political party “that – in the name of austerity – withdraws support from the poor, the sick, the foreign, and the unemployed while rewarding those in society who are least in need of reward” was “as objectionable as expressing racist, sexist, or homophobic views.”&lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/election-results-backlash-as-liberal-philosopher-asks-people-to-unfriend-tories-10240131.html]” Independent article, Retrieved 10 May, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to her work in the philosophy of language, Roache has published on a variety of topics in practical ethics and metaphysics, such as which biomedical modifications to humans could be used to fight climate change.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/14/human-engineering-climate-change-philosophy]” Bioengineer humans to tackle climate change, say philosophers, The Guardian, 14 March 2012, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has an active twitter feed&lt;ref&gt; “[https://twitter.com/rebecca_roache]” Rebecca Roache, Twitter feed.&lt;/ref&gt;. On 25 July 2018, she was listed among the top 100 philosophers on Twitter. &lt;ref&gt;“[https://truesciphi.org/phi.html]” Philosophers on Twitter, accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997. Accessed July 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''''' ({{lang-es|El sueño de la razón produce monstruos}}) is an [[etching]] by the Spanish painter and printmaker [[Francisco Goya]]. Created between 1797 and 1799,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |title=Goya - The Sleep of Reason |publisher=Eeweems.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107043903/http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the 43rd of 80 etchings making up the suite of satires ''[[Los caprichos|Los Caprichos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.cornell.edu/collections/view/the-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters.html ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''] [[Johnson Museum of Art]], [[Cornell University]], 2013. Retrieved 11 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goya imagines himself asleep amidst his drawing tools, his reason dulled by slumber and bedeviled by creatures that prowl in the dark. The work includes owls that may be symbols of folly and bats symbolizing ignorance. The artist's nightmare reflected his view of Spanish society, which he portrayed in the ''Caprichos'' as demented, corrupt, and ripe for ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | authorlink = Metropolitan Museum of Art | title = Francisco de Goya y Lucientes: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters: Plate 43 of The Caprices (Los Caprichos) | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/09/eusi/ho_18.64.43.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and was the gift of M. Knoedler &amp; Co. in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338473]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full epigraph for capricho No. 43 reads; "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her (reason), she (fantasy) is the mother of the arts and the origin of their marvels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Robin M. |last2=Vrudny |first2=Kimberly J. |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=if4hQec2ClEC&amp;pg=PA39 |title=Visual Theology: Forming and Transforming the Community Through the Arts |publisher=Liturgical Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-814-65399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of [[C. P. Snow]]'s [[Strangers and Brothers|''The Sleep of Reason'', tenth book in his "Strangers and Brothers" series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/an-elegiac-ending-to-cp-snows-11novel-cycle-last-things.html?_r=0|title=An elegiac ending to C. P. Snow's 11‐novel cycle|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel ''[[The Sleep of Reason]]'' are drawn from this print. It also inspired the cover of the [[Andrew Miller (novelist)|Andrew Miller]] novel [[Pure (Miller novel)|''Pure'']], as well as the 2017 album by Swedish metal band Meshuggah, entitled ''[[The Violent Sleep of Reason]].'' Also the names of Finnish occult metal band [[Sleep of Monsters]] and their first album, ''[[Produces Reason]]'' derive from the name of the title.

Occasionally the title phrase is rendered as "The dream of reason produces monsters", since the Spanish word "sueño" can mean either "sleep" or "dream". However, Goya's epigraph makes it clear that his intended interpretation is "the sleep of reason".

In [[philosophy]] and particularly [[political philosophy]], '''theoreticism''' is the preference for theory over practice (or, more broadly, abstract knowledge over concrete action), or a philosophical position which would lead to such a preference.

The term is often used pejoratively.  In [[Marxist philosophy]], for instance, theoreticism is often identified as a political error, valorizing the efforts of [[academic]] Marxism over those of revolutionary struggle.  [[Louis Althusser]], for instance, criticized his own early work for theoreticism.  In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], theoreticism would be something closer to the over-valuing of [[knowledge]] at the cost of losing a proper appreciation of [[experience]].  [[Martin Heidegger]] claimed this trend was begun by [[Plato]], and that it continued in an "intensification and hardening of 'theoreticism', the drive toward technical and objectifying modes of knowledge and, with it, the oblivion of any more primordial or more reverential kind of existence."
