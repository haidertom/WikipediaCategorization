'''''A General Map of the World, or Terraqueous Globe''''', full title: '''''A General Map of the World, or Terraqueous Globe with all the New Discoveries and Marginal Delineations, Containing the Most Interesting Particulars in the Solar, Starry and Mundane System''''', is a general [[World map|map of the world]], or terraqueous globe with all the new discoveries and marginal delineations, containing the most interesting particulars in the [[sun|solar]], starry and mundane system by [[Samuel Dunn (mathematician)|Samuel Dunn]] and [[Thomas Kitchin]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A correct Chart of the terraqueous Globe on which are Described Lines shewing the Variation of the Magnetic Needle in the most frequented Seas. Originally composed in the Year 1700 / By the Celebrated Dr. Edmund Halley ; Renewed by William Mountaine and James Dodson, ... 1756 and now Published with all the Necessary Emendations|date=1794-01-01|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b5970593z|publisher=Laurie &amp; Whittle|language=English|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map also features [[star chart]]s, map of the Moon, map of the [[Solar System]] and numerous other features along with [[Earth|earth's]] both [[hemispheres of the Earth|hemispheres]]. Samuel Dunn Map is so large and so rich in detail that it is exceptionally challenging to do it full justice in either photographic or textual descriptions.

== Map details ==
The primary map is surrounded on all sides by detailed scientific calculations and descriptions as well as [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]] [[star chart]]s, a map of the moon, a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] analemma chart, a map of the [[Solar System]], a mercator projection of the World, an analemma projection, a seasonal chart, a universal scale chart, and numerous smaller diagrams depicting planets and mathematical systems. All text is in English. We will start our survey of this map in North America, much of which was, even in 1794, largely unknown.

This map follows shortly after the explorations of captain [[James Cook]] in the Arctic and [[Pacific Northwest]], so the general outline of the continent is known. However, when this map was made, few inland expeditions had extended westward beyond the [[Mississippi]]. This map notes two separate speculative courses for the apocryphal river of the west, a northern route extending from lake Winnipeg and a southern route passing south of Winnipeg through Pike's lake. The River of the West was hopeful dream of French and English explorers who were searching for a water passage through North America to the Pacific. In concept, should such a route be found, it would have become an important trade artery allowing the British and French, whose colonies dominated the eastern parts of North America, to compete with the Spanish for control of the lucrative Asia-Pacific trade. Little did these earlier speculative cartographers realize the bulk of the Rocky Mountains stood between them and their dreams. The kingdom of [[Quivira]], which is one of the lands associated with Spanish legends of the [[Seven Cities of Gold]] is located slightly south of the western rivers.

[[File:Ballast water en.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the water pollution of the seas from untreated ballast water discharges]]
[[Ballast water]] discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the [[marine environment]]. The discharge of ballast water and sediments by ships is governed globally under the [[Ballast Water Management Convention]], since its entry into force in September 2017. It is also controlled through national regulations, which may be separate from the Convention, such as [[Ballast water regulation in the United States|in the United States]].

Cruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo, and discharged at the next port of call, wherever more cargo is loaded. Ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials, including [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]]. These materials often include non-native, nuisance, exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems, along with serious human health issues including death.

==Problematic species==
There are hundreds of organisms carried in ballast water that cause problematic ecological effects outside of their natural range. The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) lists the ten most unwanted species as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-control-and-management-of-ships'-ballast-water-and-sediments-(bwm).aspx|title=International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments |publisher=International Maritime Organization}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*Cholera ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' (various strains)
*Cladoceran Water Flea ''[[Cercopagis pengoi]]''
*Mitten Crab ''[[Eriocheir sinensis]]''
*Toxic algae (red/brown/green tides) (various species)
*Round Goby ''[[Neogobius melanostomus]]''
*North American Comb Jelly ''[[Mnemiopsis leidyi]]''
*North Pacific Seastar ''[[Asterias amurensis]]''
*Zebra Mussel ''[[Dreissena polymorpha]]''
*Asian Kelp ''[[Undaria pinnatifida]]''
*European Green Crab ''[[Carcinus maenas]]''

==Ballast water issues by country==
===New Zealand===
The ballast tanks in New Zealand carry animals and plants that kill ecosystems. Ballast tanks are only used in cargo ships there. Ballast water is controlled under the [[Biosecurity Act 1993]].

===Peru===
A form of [[cholera]], ''Vibrio cholerae'', previously reported only in [[Bangladesh]] apparently arrived via ballast water in [[Peru]] in 1991, killing more than 10,000 people over the following three years.&lt;ref&gt;Living Beyond Our Means: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005. Statement from the Board.{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Ballast water regulation in the United States}}
The [[zebra mussel]], which is native to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, arrived in [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] in the ballast water of a transatlantic freighter in 1988. Within 10 years it had spread to all of the five neighbouring [[Great Lakes]]. The economic cost of this introduction has been estimated by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] at about $5 billion.

Ballast water discharges are believed to be the leading source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, thus posing public health and environmental risks, as well as significant economic cost to industries such as water and power utilities, commercial and recreational fisheries, agriculture, and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Catherine Hazlewood, The Ocean Conservancy, âBallast Water Management: New International Standards and NISA Reauthorization,â Hearing, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, 108th Cong., 2nd sess., March 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the economic cost just from introduction of pest mollusks (zebra mussels, the [[Asian clam]], and others) to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is more than $6 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Lori Lach, Rodolfo Zuniga, and Doug Morrison, âEnvironmental and Economic Costs Associated with Non-indigenous Species in the United States,â presented at AAAS Conference, Anaheim, CA, January 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Invasive Species Act]] in 1996 in order to regulate ballast water discharges.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Pub. L. 104-332. October 26, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] issued ballast water regulations in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, D.C. "Standards for Living Organisms in Shipsâ Ballast Water Discharged in U.S. Waters." ''Federal Register,'' {{Federal Register|77|17254}}, 2012-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the authority of the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published its latest ''Vessel General Permit'' in 2013. The permit sets numeric ballast water discharge limits for commercial vessels {{convert|79|ft|m}} in length or greater.&lt;ref name="EPA-permits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/vessels-incidental-discharge-permitting-4 |title=Vessels Incidental Discharge Permitting |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-09 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA issued a separate permit for smaller commercial vessels in 2014.&lt;ref name="EPA-permits" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2014-09-10).

===Singapore===
Among 818 ports in the Pacific region, Singapore alone accounts for an estimated of 26 percent of cross-region (long range) species exchange. Via targeted ballast management on Singapore and a few other "influential" ports, cross-region species exchange to/from the Pacific region can be combinatorially reduced.&lt;ref name="XuWickramarathne2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data|year=2014|pages=1699â1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMO convention==
{{Main|Ballast Water Management Convention}}
To react to the growing concerns about environmental impact of ballast water discharge, the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) adopted in 2004 the "''[[Ballast Water Management Convention|International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments]]''" to control the environmental damage from ballast water.
The Convention will require all ships to implement a "Ballast water management plan" including a ballast water record book and carrying out ballast water management procedures to a given standard.
Guidelines are given for additional measures then the guidelines.

The goals of the convention are to minimise damage to the environment by:
* Minimise the uptake of organisms during ballasting.
* Minimising the uptake of sediments during ballasting.
* Ballast water exchange while at sea (the ship should be minimum 200 nautical miles from shore with a depth of minimum 200 metres and can use the flow through or sequential method). At least 95 percent of the total ballast water should be exchanged.
* Treatment of the ballast water by chemical or mechanical influences (UV-radiation, filter, deoxygenation, cavitation, ozoneâ¦)

Control measures include:
* ''International Ballast Water Management Certificate''
* Ballast water management plan
* Ballast water record book

The IMO convention was ratified by enough countries and entered into force on September 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Benelux Office for Intellectual Property''' ('''BOIP''') is the registration office for [[trademark]]s and [[design]]s in the [[Benelux]]. The BOIP is the legal successor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0001716/AuthentiekNL/VDRTKS559907/TITELV/Artikel51/geldigheidsdatum_10-08-2014|title=Article 5.1,Benelux Convention on Intellectual Property|publisher=Government of the Netherlands|accessdate=10 August 2014|language=Dutch|quote=De Organisatie is de rechtsopvolger van het Benelux-Merkenbureau (...), en van het Benelux-Bureau voor Tekeningen of Modellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the '''Benelux Trademarks Office''' (Dutch: ''Benelux-Merkenbureau'', French: ''Bureau Benelux des Marques'') and the '''Benelux Designs Office''' (Dutch: ''Benelux-Bureau voor Tekeningen of Modellen'', French: ''Bureau Benelux des Dessins ou ModÃ¨les''). The BOIP is based at [[The Hague]], Netherlands.

The BOIP is part of the Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property, established by the Benelux Convention on Intellectual Property, which was signed on 25 February 2005&lt;ref&gt;diplomatie.be, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, [http://www.diplomatie.be/en/treaties/treatiesdetail.asp?TEXTID=988 List of Treaties of which Belgium is the depositary]. Retrieved on 19 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 1 September 2006. The Benelux Convention on Intellectual Property replaced the Benelux Convention on Trade Marks (1962) and the Benelux Convention on Designs (1966).

==Other jurisdictions==
Besides acting for the Benelux territory per se, BOIP also acts as the registration office for trade marks of the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] since the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010. Until 10 October 2011 pre-existing Netherlands Antilles' trademarks had to be confirmed with the office in order to remain valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribie.nl/en|work=BOIP|accessdate=11 June 2014|title=Registration of Trademarks in Caribbean Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1 January 2015, the BOIP also serves as the back office for the Bureau for Intellectual Property of Sint Maarten (BIP SXM), a task which had been performed by the trademark office of CuraÃ§ao since 10 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boip.int/wps/portal/site/bbie/news/newsitem/!ut/p/a1/rZJRT4MwFIX_invwsWkpK7SPsMAsMkQwcfBiulGwy-iYa9Sfb3EPThMzl9ine5Lb75z2XljDJay1eFWdMGqnxXbUtfc0K0IehE6A5inBiEcsnnv5Hc6RCx9hDeu1NoN5htVqpSTQ8u0ApL5GY6GM7E-rg9LmqhfixUg93hxEJxt5UN1RrVUDK5_4xGPSB43AEkzF1AUMszWgLWFWOBQJaoNVp8HQIvQRXwTJbZZmLmXun3KfIXw2oF9OgH4SvpuwCJ-xyAms7Cv8rwZaxtQSHmbxDQ-LMnRgeeG3HIEcM8wxRQm6j61jRkkRsdx1OP5v4OUJk3OTsZNVm_2-Duxe7bSR7wYuL1ysoe_ppk29ImqzDIgVRS7ZdpPJB7gMWlg!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/|work=BOIP|accessdate=11 June 2014|title=Sint Maarten and the BOIP conclude agreement on trademark law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioversity International''' is a global research-for-development organization with a vision â that [[agricultural biodiversity]] nourishes people and sustains the planet. The organization delivers scientific evidence, management practices and policy options to use and safeguard [[agricultural biodiversity]] to attain global [[food security|food]] and nutrition security, working with partners in low-income countries in different regions where agricultural biodiversity can contribute to improved nutrition, resilience, productivity and [[climate change adaptation]].

Bioversity International is a member of the [[CGIAR]], a global research partnership for a food-secure future.

The organization is highly decentralized, with about 300 staff working around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/where-we-work/ Where Bioversity International works]&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[Maccarese]], outside Rome, Italy, with regional offices located in Central and South America, West and Central Africa, East and Southern Africa, Central and South Asia, and South-east Asia.

== Background ==
Bioversity International is a research-for-development organization focused on safeguarding and using [[agricultural biodiversity]] to help meet challenges such as adaptation to [[climate change]] and increased [[sustainable production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/bioversity-internationals-10-year-strategy-2014-2024 Bioversity International 10-year Strategy 2014-2024]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization takes the view that the diversity of plants and animals offers opportunities not only through [[Sexual reproduction|breeding]] but also by delivering many other benefits. Some are direct, such as the better nutrition and greater sustainability that come with locally-adapted crops. Others are indirect, like the [[ecosystem services]] delivered by healthy populations of [[pollinator]]s, [[biological control]] agents, and [[soil microbes]]. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/agricultural-biodiversity-is-essential-for-a-sustainable-improvement-in-food-and-nutrition-security Frison, E.A.; Cherfas, J.; Hodgkin, T. Agricultural Biodiversity Is Essential for a Sustainable Improvement in Food and Nutrition Security. Sustainability 2011, 3, 238-253.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Bioversity International is governed by a Board of Trustees, including one Trustee nominated by the host country (Italy) and one nominated by [[FAO]]. The Board also appoints the Director General who manages the operation of the various programs. The current Director General, M. Ann Tutwiler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgiar.org/about-us/our-governance/center-director-generals/profile/tutwiler/|title=CGIAR Center Director Generals - Bioversity International|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cgiar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, will remain in her position until the end of 2018.

==History==
In 2014, Bioversity International marked 40 years of operations. Bioversity International was originally established by the CGIAR as the International Board for [[Plant Genetic Resources]] (IBPGR) in 1974. In October 1991, IBPGR became the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and in 1994 IPGRI began independent operation as one of the centers of the CGIAR. At the request of the CGIAR, in 1994 IPGRI took over the governance and administration of the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP). In 2006, IPGRI and INIBAP became a single organization and subsequently changed their operating name to Bioversity International. Bioversity International still maintains the world's largest banana [[genetic database|gene bank]], the Bioversity International ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre, that is hosted at the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven) in Leuven, Belgium, and manages [[ProMusa]] - a platform that shares knowledge about [[Banana|bananas]] and [[Cooking banana|plantains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/ Bioversity International history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Crop Trust|Global Crop Diversity Trust]] was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the CGIAR and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://time.com/doomsday-vault/|title=Inside the 'Doomsday' Vault|last=|first=|date=|work=TIME|access-date=26 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Publications==
Bioversity International and its predecessors have published occasional papers under the title ''Issues in Genetic Resources''. In 2017, the organization published ''Mainstreaming Agrobiodiversity In Sustainable Food Systems - Scientific Foundations for an Agrobiodiversity Index'', a book that put the spotlight on the importance of [[Agricultural biodiversity|agrobiodiversity]] as the foundation of our food supplies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-also-threatens-global-food-supplies|title=Sixth mass extinction of wildlife also threatens global food supplies|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''World Marrow Donor Association''' (WMDA) is an organization based in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], that coordinates the collection of the HLA phenotypes and other relevant data of volunteer [[hematopoietic]] cell donors (used to perform what used to be called [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplants]], but now referred as [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic cell transplants]]) and [[cord blood]] units across the globe.

The global database with volunteer donors was founded in the Netherlands in 1988. Today, the Search &amp; Match Service of WMDA is the world's largest hematopoietic cell database, listing more than 30 million stem cell donors and over 750,000 cord blood units. WMDA participants consist of 75 hematopoietic cell donor registries from 53 countries, and 53 cord blood banks from 36 countries. For further details on the number of Donors/Cord Blood Units (CBU) per registry within the BMDW database [https://statistics.wmda.info click here].

These global hematopoietic cells from donors or cord blood units are used to transplant patients around the world with a variety of with life-threatening blood disorders such as [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[aplastic anemia]], as well as certain [[immune system]] and [[metabolic disorder]]s.

It is also considered part of [[Central Africa]]. Burundi's capital is [[Bujumbura]]. The southwestern border is adjacent to [[Lake Tanganyika]].

The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]], until the beginning of the 20th century, when [[German Empire|Germany]] colonised the region.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Strizek, "Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft", Berlin: Ch. Links Verlag, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]] and Germany's defeat, it ceded the territory to [[Belgium]]. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. Despite common misconceptions, Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation.

Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a [[Kingdom of Burundi|monarchy]], but a series of assassinations, coups and a general climate of [[Congo Crisis|regional instability]] culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of [[ethnic cleansing]] and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the [[Burundian Genocide#1972|1970s]] and again in the [[Burundian Civil War|1990s]] left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world's poorest]].&lt;ref name="xlix"&gt;[[#Eggers|Eggers]], p. xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 witnessed [[2015 Burundian unrest|large-scale political strife]] as President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] opted to run for a third term in office, a [[2015 Burundian coup d'Ã©tat attempt|coup attempt failed]] and the country's [[Burundian legislative election, 2015|parliamentary]] and [[Burundian presidential election, 2015|presidential]] elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Burundi}}
Burundi is one of the few countries in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups; the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.&lt;ref&gt;Uvin, Peter. 1999. "Ethnicity and Power in Burundi and Rwanda: Different Paths to Mass Violence" in Comparative Politics, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Apr., 1999), pp. 253-271 Published by: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is important to note that the nature of culture and ethnic groups is always fluid and changing. While the groups might have migrated to the area at different times and as distinctly different ethnic groups, the current distinctions are contemporary socio-cultural constructs. Initially the different ethnic groups lived together in relative peace. The first conflicts between ethnic groups can be dated back to the 17th century, when land was becoming ever more scarce because of the continuous growth in population.

===Kingdom of Burundi===
{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi}}
The first evidence of the Burundian state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours.
The Kingdom of Burundi, or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Kingdom of Burundi". EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (Online ed.). Retrieved 15 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, known as the mwami (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (ganwa) which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi).  The Kingdom of Burundi was characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.&lt;ref&gt;VANDEGINSTE, S., Stones left unturned: law and transitional justice in Burundi, Antwerp-Oxford-Portland, Intersentia, 2010, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabireâa patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru, they had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima.  In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity however, some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Collins &amp; J. M. Burns. 2007. A History of Sub-Saharan Africa, Cambridge University Press. Page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the Ganwa. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one.&lt;ref&gt;ChrÃ©tien, Jean-Pierre (2003). The Great Lakes of Africa: Two Thousand Years of History. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-1-890951-34-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weissman"&gt;WEISSMAN, S., Preventing genocide in Burundi: lessons from international diplomacy, Washington D.C., United States Institute of Peace Press, 1998, p5.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many reports of marriages between Hutu and Tutsi people.&lt;ref&gt;Conflicten Bank Burundi, http://www.cmo.nl/conflictenbank/index.php?Afrika:Grote-Merengebied:Burundi {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701141046/http://www.cmo.nl/conflictenbank/index.php?Afrika:Grote-Merengebied:Burundi# |date=1 July 2015 }}, (consultatie 4 februari 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, regional ties and tribal power struggles played a far more determining role in Burundi's politics than ethnicity.&lt;ref name="weissman" /&gt;

Burundi ceased to be a monarchy when king Ntare V Ndizeye was deposed by his Prime Minister and Chief of Staff, Capt. Michel Micombero, who abolished the monarchy and declared a republic following the November 1966 coup d'Ã©tat.

===Colonisation===
{{Main|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
From 1884, the [[German East Africa Company]] was active in the African Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the German East Africa Company, the [[British Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], the [[German Empire]] was called upon to put down the [[Abushiri revolt]]s and protect the empire's interests in the region. The German East Africa Company transferred its rights to the German Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the German colony of [[German East Africa]], which included Burundi, Rwanda, and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]] (formerly known as [[Tanganyika]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|title=German East Africa {{!}} former German dependency, Africa|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902012730/https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa#|archive-date=2 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Empire stationed armed forces in Ruanda and Burundi during the late 1880s.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]], the [[British Empire]] and [[Belgium]] launched a coordinated attack on the German colony. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The Force Publique and the British [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strachan, H.

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[Belgian colonial empire]]. Ruanda-Urundi continued its kingship [[dynasty]] despite the invasion of Europeans.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html CIA â The World Factbook â Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128152115/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html# |date=28 January 2018 }} [[CIA]].

The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions, the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Following the [[Second World War]], Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers.&lt;ref name="wein5"/&gt; In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form [[political parties]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; These factions contributed to Burundi gaining its independence from Belgium, on 1 July 1962.

On 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwami Mwambutsa IV]] requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union.&lt;ref name="wein7"&gt;{{cite book |last = Weinstein|first = Warren |author2=Robert Schrere |title = Political Conflict and Ethnic Strategies: A Case Study of Burundi|publisher=Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs |year = 1976|location = Syracuse University |isbn = 0-915984-20-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi.&lt;ref name="wein7"/&gt; The first and largest of these political parties was the [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA).

Burundi's push for independence was influenced by the [[Rwandan Revolution]] and the accompanying instability and ethnic conflict that occurred there.

&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, King [[Ntare V of Burundi]] returned from exile, heightening political tension in the country. On 29 April 1972, the 24-year-old Ntare V was murdered. In subsequent months, the Tutsi-dominated government of [[Micombero]] used the army to combat Hutu rebels and commit genocide, murdering targeted members of the Hutu majority. The total number of casualties was never established, but contemporary estimates put the number of people killed between 80,000 and 210,000.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Matthew.

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'Ã©tat|bloodless coup]] to toppled Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained Burundi's status as a [[one-party state]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.

Major [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) [[1987 Burundian coup d'Ã©tat|overthrew Bagaza in 1987]], suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to killings of Tutsi peasants in the northern communes of [[Ntega]] and [[Marangara]] in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}; some international NGOs believed this understated the deaths.

The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an [[amnesty]] for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the "culture of impunity." Other analysts put the origins of the "culture of impunity" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to Pierre [[Buyoya]], asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed [[Adrien Sibomana]] (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; but a [[civil war]] broke out.

An estimated total of 250,000 people died in Burundi from the various conflicts between 1962 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;

===First attempt at democracy and genocide against Tutsi===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. In October 1993, Tutsi soldiers assassinated Ndadaye, an act which resulted in a genocide against Tutsi, which led to years of violence between Hutu rebels and Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm Country profile Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm# |date=7 October 2011 }}.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[JuvÃ©nal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their aeroplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in the capital,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Bujumbura, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996 Burundian coup d'Ã©tat|coup d'Ã©tat]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998, this was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm Burundi Civil War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229122327/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm# |date=29 December 2017 }}. Global Security&lt;/ref&gt; Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[South Africa]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pretoria]], South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled Burundian government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64D9N7?OpenDocument Global Ceasefire Agreement between Burundi and the CNDD-FDD]. 20 November 2003.

===Peace agreements===
[[File:Burundi soldiers.png|thumb|alt=three soldiers in a wood by roadside with machine gun|Tutsi militia near the Zairian border, 1996]]
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death, South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and United States President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The peace talks took the form of [[Track I mediation]]s. This method of negotiation can be defined as a form of diplomacy involving governmental or intergovernmental representatives, who may use their positive reputations, mediation or the "carrot and stick" method as a means of obtaining or forcing an outcome, frequently along the lines of "bargaining" or "win-lose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ramsbotham, Oliver; Woodhouse, Tom and Miall, Hugh |title=Contemporary Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IbuQE02-KkC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4974-0|pages=24â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective was to transform the Burundian government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was sceptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000, the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups â such as the Forces for National Liberation â remained active.

===UN involvement===

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa and [[Uganda]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in Burundi|African Union Mission to Burundi]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"&gt;Howard, Lise Morje (2008). UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire; carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants; support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return; assist with elections; protect international staff and Burundian civilians; monitor Burundi's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows; and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt;

The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing:  no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt;

The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Burundi_2005?lang=en Constitution] was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.

While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt; It was involved with several "quick effect" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.

===2006 to 2015===

The 2007 report&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; of [[Amnesty International]] mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. [[Genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] remain unpunished. The establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and a Special [[Tribunal]] for investigation and prosecution has not yet been implemented. The freedom of expression is limited; journalists are frequently arrested for carrying out legitimate professional activities. A total of 38,087 Burundian refugees have been repatriated between January and November 2007.

In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity .&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.

On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The Burundian army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader [[Agathon Rwasa]], with the mediation of [[Charles Nqakula]], South Africa's Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 Peace Building Commission Update, A project of the Institute for Global Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819200320/http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114#more-114 |date=19 August 2017 }}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics of Burundi}}

Burundi's political system is that of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic based upon a multi-party state. The President of Burundi is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. There are currently 21 [[List of political parties in Burundi|registered parties in Burundi]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; On 13 March 1992, Tutsi coup leader [[Pierre Buyoya]] established a constitution,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; Six years later, on 6 June 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]]'s seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents. Because of the [[Arusha Accords (Burundi)|Arusha Accord]], Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000.&lt;ref name="unburundi"/&gt;

Burundi's legislative branch is a [[bicameral]] assembly, consisting of the Transitional National Assembly and the [[Senate of Burundi|Transitional Senate]]. {{As of|2004}}, the Transitional National Assembly consisted of 170 members, with the Front for Democracy in Burundi holding 38% of seats, and 10% of the assembly controlled by UPRONA. Fifty-two seats were controlled by other parties. Burundi's constitution mandates representation in the Transitional National Assembly to be consistent with 60% Hutu, 40% Tutsi, and 30% female members, as well as three Batwa members.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote and serve five-year terms.&lt;ref name=Puddington/&gt;

The Transitional Senate has fifty-one members, and three seats are reserved for former presidents. Due to stipulations in Burundi's constitution, 30% of Senate members must be female. Members of the Senate are elected by electoral colleges, which consist of members from each of Burundi's provinces and communes.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2821.htm Background Note: Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126181743/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2821.htm# |date=26 January 2018 }}.

{{Main|Geography of Burundi}}

One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi is landlocked and has an equatorial climate. Burundi is a part of the [[Albertine Rift]], the western extension of the [[East African Rift]]. The country lies on a rolling [[plateau]] in the centre of Africa. The average elevation of the central plateau is {{convert|5600|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, [[Mount Heha]] at {{convert|8810|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; lies to the southeast of the capital, Bujumbura. The source of the [[Nile River]] is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the [[Ruvyironza River]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} [[Lake Victoria]] is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the [[Kagera River]].&lt;ref&gt;Klohn, Wulf and Mihailo Andjelic.

Burundi's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture. Settlement by rural populations has led to [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[habitat loss]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; Deforestation of the entire country is almost completely due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], with a mere {{convert|230|mi2|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} remaining and an ongoing loss of about 9% per annum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; There are two [[national park]]s, [[Kibira National Park]] to the northwest (a small region of rainforest, adjacent to [[Nyungwe Forest National Park]] in Rwanda), [[Ruvubu National Park]] to the northeast (along the [[Rurubu River]], also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu).

The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors â foreign aid represents 42% of Burundis national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community in 2009, which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and also in 2009 received $700 million in debt relief.

Lack of access to financial services is a serious problem for the majority of the population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. [[Microfinance]], however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions â a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/burundi/burundi-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Burundi: Financial Sector Profile |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513112229/http://www.mfw4a.org/burundi/burundi-financial-sector-profile.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy }}. mfw4a.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Burundi's culture is based on local tradition and the influence of neighbouring countries, though cultural prominence has been hindered by [[civil unrest]]. Since farming is the main industry, a typical Burundian meal consists of [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]] and [[pea]]s. Due to the expense, meat is eaten only a few times per month.

When several Burundians of close acquaintance meet for a gathering they drink ''impeke'', a beer, together from a large container to symbolise unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |title=Eating the Burundian Way |accessdate=21 July 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201411/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |archivedate=16 June 2006 |df=dmy }}.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Cholera is caused by a number of [[serotype|types]] of ''Vibrio cholerae'', with some types producing more severe disease than others.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; It is spread mostly by [[waterborne diseases|unsafe water]] and [[foodborne illness|unsafe food]] that has been contaminated with [[human feces]] containing the bacteria.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Undercooked [[seafood]] is a common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of Infection &amp; Risk Factors|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/infection-sources.html|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=November 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312223337/http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/infection-sources.html|archivedate=12 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are the only animal affected.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Risk factors]] for the disease include poor [[sanitation]], not enough clean [[drinking water]], and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; There are concerns that [[rising sea level]]s will increase rates of disease.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Cholera can be diagnosed by a [[stool test]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cholera vaccines: WHO position paper|journal=Wkly.

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to [[drinking water|clean water]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2012 /&gt; [[Cholera vaccine]]s that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by ''[[Escherichia coli|E.&amp;nbsp;coli]]''.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; The primary treatment is [[oral rehydration therapy]]âthe replacement of fluids with [[electrolytes|slightly sweet and salty solutions]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Rice-based solutions are preferred.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Zinc supplementation]] is useful in children.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Zinc&gt;{{cite web|title=Cholera â Vibrio cholerae infection Treatment|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/treatment/index.html|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=November 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311042338/http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/treatment/index.html|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In severe cases, [[intravenous fluid]]s, such as [[Ringer's lactate]], may be required, and [[antibiotic]]s may be beneficial.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Antibiotic sensitivity|Testing to see which antibiotic]] the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Pro /&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and society --&gt;
Cholera affects an estimated 3â5&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide and causes 28,800â130,000&amp;nbsp;deaths a year.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015De /&gt; Although it is classified as a [[pandemic]] {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, it is rare in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Children are mostly affected.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cholera â Vibrio cholerae infection|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/index.html|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=October 27, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317031930/http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/index.html|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera occurs as both [[epidemic|outbreaks]] and [[endemic|chronically in certain areas]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5% but may be as high as 50%.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; No access to treatment results in a higher death rate.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2012 /&gt; The study of cholera in England by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Timmreck|first1=Thomas C.|title=An introduction to epidemiology|date=2002|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=978-0-7637-0060-7|page=77|edition=3.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyrbKemADL4C&amp;pg=PA77|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203190442/https://books.google.com/books?id=yyrbKemADL4C&amp;pg=PA77|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|Seven large outbreaks]] have occurred over the last 200 years with millions of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cholera's seven pandemics |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cholera-s-seven-pandemics-1.758504 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=CBC |date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Cholera feces.jpg|thumb|Typical cholera diarrhea that looks like  "rice water".]]

Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic, and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. [[Kussmaul breathing]], a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of [[acidosis]] from [[Human feces|stool]] [[bicarbonate]] losses and [[lactic acidosis]] associated with poor [[perfusion]]. [[Blood pressure]] drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, [[seizures]], or even [[coma]] due to [[electrolyte imbalance]]s are common, especially in children.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

=== Transmission ===
Cholera has been found in two animal populations: [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].&lt;ref name="Lancet2004" /&gt;

[[Transmission (medicine)|Transmission]] is usually through the [[fecal-oral route]] of contaminated food or water caused by poor [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="WHO2010" /&gt; Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in the developing world it is more often water.&lt;ref name="Lancet2004" /&gt; Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as [[oyster]]s in waters infected with [[sewage]], as ''Vibrio cholerae'' accumulates in [[plankton]]ic [[copepod|crustaceans]] and the oysters eat the [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|title=Oceans, Climate, and Health: Cholera as a Model of Infectious Diseases in a Changing Environment|publisher=James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy|people=[[Rita Colwell]]|accessdate=2013-10-23|location=Rice University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026030733/http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|archivedate=2013-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as "rice-water", contaminates water used by others.&lt;ref name="Sherris"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0|edition=4th|pages=376â7|editor1=Ryan KJ |editor2=Ray CG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of ''V. cholerae'' in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/cholera-biology-and-genetics|title=Cholera Biology and Genetics {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, [[groundwater]] or [[drinking water]] supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely [[contagious disease|spread directly from person to person]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

''V. cholerae'' also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], or [[Biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] detritus.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=EJ|last2=Harris|first2=JB|last3=Morris|first3=JG|last4=Calderwood|first4=SB|last5=Camilli|first5=A| title=Cholera transmission: the host, pathogen and bacteriophage dynamic|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|date=7 October 2009|volume=7|issue=10|pages=693â702|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2204|pmid=19756008|pmc=3842031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of ''V. cholerae'' to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as '[[viable but non-culturable]]' (VBNC) or more conservatively '[[active but non-culturable]]' (ABNC).&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; One study indicates that the culturability of ''V. cholerae'' drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJOct2008plos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson |first1=EJ |last2=Chowdhury |first2=A |last3=Flynn |first3=J |last4=Schild |first4=Stefan |last5=Bourassa |first5=L |last6=Shao |first6=Yue |last7=LaRocque|first7=RC|last8=Calderwood|first8=SB|last9=Qadri|first9=F|last10=Camilli|first10=A| title=Transmission of ''Vibrio cholerae'' Is Antagonized by Lytic Phage and Entry into the Aquatic Environment|journal=PLoS Pathog|date=24 October 2008|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e1000187|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000187|pmid=18949027|pmc=2563029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire [[toxicity]] through a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]].&lt;ref name="Archivist_1997"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Cholera phage discovery|url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/76/3/274|journal=Arch.

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100{{nbsp}}million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; This dose, however, is less in those with lowered [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Persons with [[immunodeficiency|lowered immunity]], such as persons with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] or [[malnutrition|malnourished]] children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected.&lt;ref name=WHOpreventionandcontrolofoutbreaks&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf Prevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122092541/http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf |date=2011-11-22 }}, World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, undated but citing sources from '07, '04, '03, '04, and '05.&lt;/ref&gt; Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional [[health care provider]].{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cystic fibrosis]] genetic [[mutation]] known as [[delta-F508]] in humans has been said to maintain a selective [[heterozygous advantage]]: [[heterozygous]] carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections.&lt;ref name="Bertranpetit_1996"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|title=Genetic and geographical variability in cystic fibrosis: evolutionary considerations|journal=Ciba Found. Symp.|volume=197|issue=|pages=97â114; discussion 114â8|pmid=8827370|vauthors=Bertranpetit J, Calafell F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the genetic deficiency in the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the [[intestinal epithelium]], thus reducing the effects of an infection.

== Mechanism ==

When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the [[Gastric acid|acidic]] conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].&lt;ref name="BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015" /&gt; The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored [[nutrient]]s during the passage through the stomach by shutting down [[protein]] production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they must propel themselves through the thick [[Mucus#Digestive system|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.&lt;ref name="BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Almagro-Moreno|first1=S|last2=Pruss|first2=K|last3=Taylor|first3=RK|title=Intestinal Colonization Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae.|journal=PLOS Pathog.|date=May 2015|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e1004787|pmid=25996593|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004787|pmc=4440752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the [[flagellum|flagella]] to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein [[flagellin]] to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the [[exotoxin|toxic proteins]] that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an [[oligomer]]ic complex made up of six [[protein subunit]]s: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a [[disulfide bond]]. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]]. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Neal CJ, Jobling MG, Holmes RK, Hol WG | title = Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5737 | pages = 1093â6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16099990 | doi = 10.1126/science.1113398 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1093O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]]. This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called [[CTXÏ Bacteriophage|CTXÏ]].

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.&lt;ref name="DiRita"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ | title = Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | pages = 5403â7 | date = June 1991 | pmid = 2052618 | pmc = 51881 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.12.5403 | url = | ref = harv | bibcode = 1991PNAS...88.5403D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump [[chloride]] ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.&lt;ref name="DiRita" /&gt; Current{{when|date=August 2017}} research aims at discovering "the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine."&lt;ref name="DiRita" /&gt;

=== Genetic structure ===
{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}
[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] [[DNA profiling|fingerprinting]] of the pandemic [[genetic isolate|isolates]] of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two [[gene cluster|clusters]] have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2013}} {{cite journal |vauthors=Lan R, Reeves PR | title = Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism | journal = J.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
In many areas of the world, [[antibiotic resistance]] is increasing within cholera bacteria. In [[Bangladesh]], for example, most cases are resistant to [[tetracycline]], [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], and [[erythromycin]].&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; Rapid diagnostic [[assay]] methods are available for the identification of [[multiple drug resistance|multi-drug resistant]] cases.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;{{cite book|title=Real-Time PCR in microbiology: From diagnosis to characterization|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-904455-18-9|editor=Mackay IM}}&lt;/ref&gt; New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in ''in vitro'' studies.&lt;ref name="Ramamurthy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vibrio cholerae: Genomics and molecular biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-33-2|chapter=Antibiotic resistance in ''Vibrio cholerae''|author=Ramamurthy T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid [[dipstick]] test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a [[medical history|patient history]] and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''V. cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.

Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.&lt;ref name="CDC_Diag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/Laboratory-Methods-for-the-Diagnosis-of-Epidemic-Dysentery-and-Cholera.pdf|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera|year=1999|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623024004/https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/laboratory-methods-for-the-diagnosis-of-epidemic-dysentery-and-cholera.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;"Cholera Fact Sheet", World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/index.html who.int] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505185900/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/index.html |date=2012-05-05 }}.

Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper [[sanitation]] practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices present there, cholera is rare.

Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. These should be [[Disinfection|sanitized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* [[Sewage]] and [[fecal sludge management]]: In cholera-affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via [[human excreta]]. Provision of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] is an important preventative measure.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; [[Open defecation]], release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s or [[septic tank]]s into the environment need to be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=AGQVBeNM_80C&amp;pg=PA5|title=Urban Water Security: Managing Risks: UNESCO-IHP|last=Cisneros|first=Blanca Jimenez|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|date=2009-03-24|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-88162-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of [[sewage treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rd3zCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA24|title=Cholera and the Ecology of Vibrio cholerae|last=Drasar|first=B.

* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* [[Water purification]]: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g., by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s or [[#Sari filtration|sari filtration]], though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

[[Hand washing|Handwashing]] with soap or ash after using a [[toilet]] and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cholera and food safety |url=http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= |accessdate=2017-08-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821044840/http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance ===
[[File:Using Precipitation Data to Assess Risk of Cholera Outbreaks.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|A modelling approach using satellite data can enhance our ability to develop cholera risk maps in several regions of the globe.]]
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during [[Wet season|rainy seasons]]. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214042133/http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blake PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas | journal = Gastroenterol.

Spanish physician [[Jaume Ferran i Clua]] developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_101034 onlinelibrary.wiley.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211100824/http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others |date=2015-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-Jewish bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed the first cholera vaccine in July 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm haffkineinstitute.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024552/http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813â1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-72677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major "state of the art" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Dr John Snow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 ''The mode of communication of cholera''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106215135/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 |date=2015-11-06 }}, 2nd ed. (London, England:  John Churchill, 1855).&lt;/ref&gt; His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so.

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Aberth, John. Plagues in World History. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2011, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Allan Phillips]], working at the US [[Naval Medical Research Unit Two]] in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the [[Lasker Foundation]] to award him its prize in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/treatment-of-cholera/ |title= Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher= Lasker Foundation |accessdate= June 30, 2017 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170901014519/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/treatment-of-cholera/ |archivedate= September 1, 2017 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2002, Alam, ''et al.'', studied stool samples from patients at the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease]] in [[Dhaka, Bangladesh]]. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the "rice water" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.&lt;ref name="Merrell2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, Dolganov NA, Alam A, Cohen MB, Calderwood SB, Schoolnik GK, Camilli A | title = Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6889 | pages = 642â5 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050664 | pmc = 2776822 | doi = 10.1038/nature00778 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..642M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Health policy ===
In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;"Cholera vaccines. A brief summary of the March 2010 position paper" (PDF). World Health Organization. Retrieved September 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]] was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the [[James Baker Institute]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.&lt;ref name="pmid21142690"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walton DA, Ivers LC | title = Responding to cholera in post-earthquake Haiti | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 364 | issue = 1 | pages = 3â5 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142690 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1012997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.{{failed verification|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref name="pmid14758861"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pauw J | title = The politics of underdevelopment: metered to death-how a water experiment caused riots and a cholera epidemic | journal = Int. J. Health Serv. | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 819â30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14758861 | doi = 10.2190/kf8j-5nqd-xcyu-u8q7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be "Cholera-affected"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.&lt;ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=John TJ, Rajappan K, Arjunan KK | title = Communicable diseases monitored by disease surveillance in Kottayam district, Kerala state, India | journal = Indian J. Med. Res. | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 86â93 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15347857 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts.&lt;ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004" /&gt; Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.&lt;ref name="pmid1500643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985â1991 | journal = J.

According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeRoeck D, Clemens JD, Nyamete A, Mahoney RT | title = Policymakers' views regarding the introduction of new-generation vaccines against typhoid fever, shigellosis and cholera in Asia | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 21 | pages = 2762â2774 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780724 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.11.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Choe | first1 = Chongwoo | last2 = Raschky | first2 = Paul A. | title = Media, institutions, and government action: prevention vs. palliation in the time of cholera | journal = [[Eur.

Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Clare 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapp C | title = Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis worsens | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9662 | pages = 447 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19205080 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60151-3 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090827090207/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | archivedate = 2009-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Clare 2009" /&gt;

The '''ContariniâRosselli map''' of 1506 was the first printed world map showing the New World. 

The ContariniâRosselli map was designed by [[Giovanni Matteo Contarini]] and engraved by [[Francesco Rosselli]]. It is a copper-engraved map and was published in [[Venice]] or [[Florence]] in 1506. The only surviving copy is in the [[British Library]].

==Age of discovery==
There had been many voyages of discovery in the immediately preceding years:
* [[Bartolomeu Dias|Dias]]â rounding of Africa (1487)
* the discovery of Newfoundland by [[John Cabot]] (1497)
* [[Vasco da Gama]]âs travel to India (1499)
* the explorations of the Caribbean and South America by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (1492â93, 1493â94, 1498, 1502â04)
* visits to the Caribbean and South America by [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] (1499, 1501â02)

Although there had been maps created after these voyages, such as [[Juan de la Cosa]]âs map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus' second voyage) and the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino]] world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely guarded. These maps were commissioned by the Portuguese and Spanish governments, which wanted to create trade monopolies over the regions they depicted. The royal powers worried that leaked information about geography could make it easier for other nations to challenge their supremacy. Often a limited number of copies was made, to be held under lock and key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5nMCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=dBQgeFwBui&amp;dq=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;f=false|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2015-06-22|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226255316|location=|pages=60-62|language=en|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicizing the shape of the world ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
This situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The [[Contarini-Rosselli]] map of 1506 (now in the [[British Library]]) and [[Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller]]'s map of the world and globe of 1507 were influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. 

By contrast, [[Johannes Ruysch]]'s 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence.

'''Desertification''' is a type of [[land degradation]] in which a relatively [[drylands|dry]] area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife .&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2"&gt;Geist (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through [[climate change]] (particularly the current [[global warming]])&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Ning|last2=Yoon|first2=Jinho|date=1 September 2009|title=Expansion of the world's deserts due to vegetation-albedo feedback under global warming|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=36|issue=17|page=L17401|doi=10.1029/2009GL039699|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2009GeoRL..3617401Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the [[overexploitation]] of soil through human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v0265e/v0265e01.htm|title=Sustainable development of drylands and combating desertification|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual "soil death" can be spoken of,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102180358/http://ca.figu.org/the-desert-will-win.html|title=The Desert Will Win|website=FIGU-Landesgruppe Canada|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces its cause back to human overexploitation.

==Definitions==
Considerable controversy exists over the proper definition of the term "desertification" for which Helmut Geist (2005) has identified more than 100 formal definitions. The most widely accepted&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2" /&gt; of these is that of the [[Princeton University]] Dictionary which defines it as "the process of fertile land transforming into desert typically as a result of [[deforestation]], drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.sg/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define:desertification#hl=en&amp;q=desertification&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HWuXT-GGL8_NrQeTvq26AQ&amp;ved=0CCwQkQ4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=83aa6ed19b0ba29e&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809|title=define:desertification â Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Desertification has been neatly defined in the text of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/Pages/Text-Part-I.aspx|title=Part I|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to the controversy comes from the sub-grouping of types of desertification. Spanning from the very vague yet shortsighted view as the "man-made-desert" to the more broad yet less focused type as the "Non-pattern-Desert"&lt;ref&gt;Helmut J. Geist, and Eric F. Lambin. "Dynamic Causal Patterns of Desertifcation." BioScience 54.9 (2004): 817 . Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the [[French colonization]] of [[West Africa]], when the ComitÃ© d'Etudes commissioned a study on ''dessÃ©chement progressif'' to explore the prehistoric expansion of the Sahara Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mortimore, Michael|title=Adapting to drought: farmers, famines, and desertification in west Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-32312-3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's most noted [[deserts]] have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts are large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]], the largest hot desert.&lt;ref name="Desertification"&gt;United States Geological Survey, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/ "Desertification"], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification has played a significant role in human history, contributing to the collapse of several large empires, such as Carthage, Greece, and the Roman Empire, as well as causing displacement of local populations.&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"&gt;{{cite web|last=LOWDERMILK|first=W C|title=CONQUEST OF THE LAND THROUGH SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1043789.pdf|work=Soil Conservation Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitford, Walter G.|title=Ecology of desert systems|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-747261-4|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ4hZbXS8IcC&amp;pg=PA277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski (2011), Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella, Policy Studies Organization (PSO), Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geist|first=Helmut|title=The causes and progression of desertification|url=https://books.google.com/?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=desertification+and+its+effect+on+ancient+civilisations#v=onepage&amp;q=desertification%20and%20its%20effect%20on%20ancient%20civilisations&amp;f=false|work=Antony Rowe Ltd|publisher=Ashgate publishing limited|accessdate=6 July 2013|isbn=9780754643234|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence shows that the serious and extensive land deterioration occurring several centuries ago in arid regions had three epicenters: the Mediterranean, the Mesopotamian Valley, and the [[Loess Plateau]] of China, where population was dense.&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dregne|first=H.E.|title=Desertification of Arid Lands|url=http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-193/002-193.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1998, the then-current degree of southward expansion of the [[Sahara]] was not well known, due to a lack of recent, measurable expansion of the desert into the Sahel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/~alesall/ouagaCILSS/articles/sen_bams1998.pdf | title=IRI â International Research Institute for Climate and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of global warming and human activities are presented in the Sahel. In this area, the level of desertification is very high compared to other areas in the world. All areas situated in the eastern part of Africa (i.e. in the Sahel region) are characterized by a dry climate, hot temperatures, and low rainfall (300â750&amp;nbsp;mm rainfall per year). So, droughts are the rule in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Desertification/desertification2.php|title=Defining Desertification : Feature Articles|last=Riebeek|first=Holli|date=2007-01-03|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 years. The propagation of desertification in this area is considerable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savezvousque.fr/monde/progression-desert-sahara-augmente-annee.html|title=La progression du dÃ©sert du Sahara augmente chaque annÃ©e ?|website=Savezvousque.fr|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some statistics have shown that since 1900 the Sahara has expanded by 250&amp;nbsp;km to the south over a stretch of land from west to east 6,000&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecke|first=Geoffrey Van|title=Humanum 3, le secret d'Ãpidaure: suivi de Amazone City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89u9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Mon Petit Ãditeur|isbn=978-2-7483-9214-2|page=192|quote=D'aprÃ¨s Monique Mainguet, depuis 1900, le Sahara a progressÃ© vers le sud de 250 kilomÃ¨tres et ce sur un front qui en fait plus de 6000 km.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Bouquet|title=Le Sahara entre ses deux rives.

The loss of topsoil means that plants cannot take root firmly and can be uprooted by torrential water or strong winds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/30/united-nations-convention-to-combat-desertification-issues-and-challenges/|title=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification: Issues and Challenges|website=E-International Relations|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Convention (UNC) says that about six million Sahelian citizens would have to give up the desertified zones of sub-Saharan Africa for North Africa and Europe between 1997 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another major area that is being impacted by desertification is the [[Gobi Desert]]. Currently, the Gobi desert is the fastest moving desert on Earth; according to some researchers, the Gobi Desert swallows up over 1,300 square miles (3,370&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of land annually. This has destroyed many villages in its path. Currently, photos show that the Gobi Desert has expanded to the point the entire nation of Croatia could fit inside its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html?_r=0 | title=Living in China's Expanding Deserts| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is causing a major problem for the people of China. They will soon have to deal with the desert as it creeps closer. Although the Gobi Desert itself is still a distance away from Beijing, reports from field studies state there are large sand dunes forming only 70&amp;nbsp;km (43.5&amp;nbsp;mi) outside the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/371c/project/2009/Welker_Desertification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation patterning==
As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as "[[Tiger bush|Brousse tigrÃ©e]]". A mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klausmeier|first=Christopher|title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|issue=5421|pages=1826â1828|doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15182754,00.html|title=Grid of straw squares turns Chinese sand to soil â Environment â DW.COM â 23.06.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Geeson, Nichola|title=Mediterranean desertification: a mosaic of processes and responses|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-470-84448-9|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_0qg0f49GQC&amp;pg=PA58|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.

Many scientists think that one of the most common causes is [[overgrazing]], too much consumption of vegetation by cattle. Controversially, [[Allan Savory]] has claimed that the controlled movement of herds of livestock, mimicking herds of grazing wildlife, can reverse desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Holistic resource management: a conceptual framework for ecologically sound economic modelling|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|work=Ecological Economics|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523200348/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jody|title=Holistic Management Handbook: Healthy Land, Healthy Profits, Second Edition|year=2006|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1559638852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Response to request for information on the "science" and "methodology" underpinning Holistic Management and holistic planned grazing|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523074713/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drury|first1=Steve|title=Large-animal extinction in Australia linked to human hunters|url=http://earth-pages.co.uk/2012/04/13/large-animal-extinction-in-australia-linked-to-human-hunters/|publisher=Earth-Pages|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists agree, that there is a natural cause for the existence of desert in the place where is now the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]]: a natural climate cycle cause a lack of water in this area from time to time. There is a suggestion that the last time that the Sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to overgrazing by the cattle of the local population.&lt;ref name="Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=K.

One of the causes of desertification in the 20th-21st centuries is probably [[Global warming|climate change]]&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"/&gt;

==Poverty==
At least 90% of the inhabitants of drylands live in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions.&lt;ref name="holtz" /&gt; This situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity, the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;
Dobie, Ph. 2001. âPoverty and the drylandsâ, in Global Drylands Imperative, Challenge paper, Undp, Nairobi (Kenya) 16 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by [[overgrazing]], [[land exhaustion]] and [[overdrafting]] of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming. Decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential. This absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones. When unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets, as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population, most such zones are excluded from development.&lt;ref name="csf-desertification.org"&gt;[http://www.csf-desertification.org/index.php/bibliotheque/doc_details/119-cornet-antoine-2002-desertification-and-its-relationship-to-the-environment-and-development Cornet A., 2002.

Desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there. This results in mass [[human migration|migrations]] out of rural areas and into urban areas, particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in [[slums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Pasternak, Dov &amp; Schlissel, Arnold|title=Combating desertification with plants|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-46632-8|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-i8-DPf6xgC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture is a main source of income for many desert communities. The increase in desertification in theses regions has degraded the land enough where people can no longer productively farm and make a profit. This has negatively impacted the economy and increased poverty rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Lindsay C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Jen C.|last3=Reed|first3=Mark S.|last4=Dougill|first4=Andrew J.|last5=Twyman|first5=Chasca|last6=Mkwambisi|first6=David|title=Adaptations to climate change, drought and desertification: local insights to enhance policy in southern Africa|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=12|issue=7|pages=748â765|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2009.04.002|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques and countermeasures exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification, and some possess varying levels of difficulty. For some, there are numerous barriers to their implementation. Yet for others, the solution simply requires the exercise of human reason.

One less difficult solution that has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Overpopulation_Crusade#Required_Worldwide_Measures|title=The Future Of Mankind â A Billy Meier Wiki â Overpopulation Crusade|website=www.futureofmankind.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; however controversial it may be, is to bring about a cap on the population growth, and in fact to turn this into a population decay, so that each year there will gradually exist fewer and fewer humans who require the land to be depleted even further in order to grow their food.

One proposed barrier is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers, even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drost|first1=Daniel|last2=Long|first2=Gilbert|last3=Wilson|first3=David|last4=Miller|first4=Bruce|last5=Campbell|first5=William|title=Barriers to Adopting Sustainable Agricultural Practices|issue=6|url=https://www.joe.org/joe/1996december/a1.php|journal=Journal of Extension|volume=34|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is a lack of political will, and lack of funding to support [[land reclamation]] and anti-desertification programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification is recognized as a major threat to [[biodiversity]]. Some countries have developed [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to counter its effects, particularly in relation to the protection of endangered [[flora]] and [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Techniques for Desert Reclamation by Andrew S. Goudie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html Desert reclamation projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172821/http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html |date=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reforestation]] gets at one of the root causes of desertification and is not just a treatment of the symptoms. Environmental organizations&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://edenprojects.org/ Eden Reforestation Projects website], [https://vimeo.com/edenprojects on Vimeo], on {{YouTube|id=edenreforest|title=''Eden Reforestation Projects''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme [[poverty]]. There they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings, which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] launched the FAO [http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/ Drylands Restoration Initiative] in 2012 to draw together knowledge and experience on dryland restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drylands Restoration Initiative|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, FAO published global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands, in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs and the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-108912-5|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5036e.pdf&lt;!-- |accessdate=June 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Green Wall of China]]'' is a high-profile example of one method that has been finding success in this battle with desertification.{{According to whom|date=April 2018}}. This wall is a much larger-scale version of what American farmers did in the 1930s to stop the great Midwest dust bowl. This plan was proposed in the late 1970s, and has become a major ecological engineering project that is not predicted to end until the year 2055. According to Chinese reports, there have been nearly 66,000,000,000 trees planted in China's great green wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/ | title=China's 'Great Green Wall' Fights Expanding Desert| date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the success that China has been finding in stopping the spread of desertification, plans are currently be made in Africa to start a "wall" along the borders of the Sahara desert as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Techniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil.

Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

Some soils (for example, clay), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of sandy soils). Some techniques as zaÃ¯ or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth â National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&amp;nbsp;m long, 1&amp;nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home â Justdiggit|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research centra (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrients from the soil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=DÃ©partement Biologie VÃ©gÃ©tale â Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt-flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in  [[Saudi-Arabia]]. These salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-AndrÃ© BerdellÃ© July 2011] H2O magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bankâs BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest â A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change â Water Matters â State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|left|thumb|It is argued that managed grazing methods are able to restore grasslands.&lt;ref name=ASavory/&gt;]]

===Managed grazing===
Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant.&lt;ref name=Tlovell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimic natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130625040133/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|archivedate=June 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the worldâs 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt; [[Allan Savory]], as part of [[holistic management]], claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands used to support large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying;&lt;ref name=ASavory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/|title=How cows could repair the world|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[range science|range scientists]] have however not been able to experimentally confirm his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briske|first=D.

'''Engrish''' is a slang term for the misuse or [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of the [[English language]] by native speakers of [[Asian language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Christine N.|title=Translate at your own risk|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/05/entertainment/ca-engrish5|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself relates to [[Japanese speakers learning r and l|Japanese speakers' tendency]] to inadvertently substitute the English phonemes "R" and "L" for one another, a process known as [[Lallation]], because, unlike English, the [[Japanese language]] has only one [[liquid consonant]] ([[Romanization of Japanese|traditionally romanized]] with "R"). The related term "[[wasei-eigo]]" refers to [[pseudo-anglicism]]s that have entered into everyday Japanese.

While the term may refer to spoken English, it is more often used to describe written English. In Japan, it is common to add English text to items for decorative and fashion purposes. Such text is often added to create a cosmopolitan feeling rather than to be read by native English speakers, and so may often be meaningless or grammatically incorrect.

Engrish can be found in many places, including signs, menus, and advertisements. Terms such as ''Japanglish'', ''Japlish'' or ''Janglish'' for Japan, ''[[Konglish]]'' for Korea, and ''[[Chinglish]]'' for China are more specific terms for Engrish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Roots of the phenomenon==
There are two contributing factors to Japanese Engrish. Firstly, the two languages have significantly different grammar: [[Japanese language#Sentence structure|Japanese word order]], the frequent omission of [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in Japanese, the absence of [[article (grammar)|articles]], a near-complete absence of consecutive [[consonant]]s, and [[Japanese speakers learning r and l|difficulties in distinguishing /l/ and /r/]], or /Î¸/ and /s/ sounds, all contribute to substantial problems using Standard English effectively.&lt;ref name="Dougill1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougill|first=John|title=Japan and English as an alien language|journal=[[English Today]]|year=2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=18â22|url=http://student.pfmb.uni-mb.si/~mhjurisic/John%20Dougill.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0266078408000059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Japanese have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English.&lt;ref name="Kowner1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowner |first=Rotem |authorlink=Rotem Kowner |title=Japanese Miscommunication with Foreigners: In Search for Valid Accounts and Effective Remedies |journal=Jahrbuch des Deutschen Instituts fÃ¼r Japanstudien |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=117â151 |url=http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/kovner/(16)Kowner2003b.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801044152/http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/kovner/(16)Kowner2003b.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, English is frequently used in Japan for aesthetic rather than functional purposes;&lt;ref name="Ikeshima1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ikeshima|first=Jayne Hildebrand|title=Some perspectives on the phenomenon of "Engrish"|journal=Keio Journal of International Studies|date=July 2005|volume=15|pages=185â198|url=http://www.u-keiai.ac.jp/issn/menu/ronbun/no15/u050708_ikeshima.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers ''per se'', as a way of appearing "smart, sophisticated and modern", in much the same way as Japanese and similar writing scripts are used in Western fashion.&lt;ref name="Dougill2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougill|first=John|title=English as a decorative language|journal=English Today|year=1987|volume=3|issue=4|pages=33â35|doi=10.1017/S0266078400003126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is claimed that in such decorative English "there is often no attempt to try to get it right, nor do the vast majority of the Japanese population ever attempt to read the English design element in question. There is therefore less emphasis on [[spell checker|checking spelling]] and grammatical accuracy."&lt;ref name="Melin1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melin|first=Tracy|author2=Rey, Nina|title=Emphasizing Foreign Language Use to International Marketing Students: A Situational Exercise That Mimics Real-World Challenges|journal=Global Business Languages|year=2005|volume=10|pages=13â25|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1121&amp;context=gbl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other suggested roots ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
English is taught in Japanese schools with an emphasis on writing and grammar over speaking. The written word is taught using [[Romaji]] (Latin script); however, the correct pronunciation of the Romaji letters is not taught. The spoken word is taught using [[Katakana]] script. Katakana is a [[syllabary]] like [[Hiragana]] but is used specifically (inter alia) â analogously to italics in the Latin script â to denote foreign words (not just English, but also French, German etc.). Katakana script is used in daily life for many foreign words used with Japanese ("[[Gairaigo]]").

The limitations of the Katakana script mean that R and L sounds are not differentiated; and similarly the sounds F and H are expressed by only one character. Furthermore, as Katakana is made up of syllables, not individual letters, there are usually included vowels that should be ignored in a Katakana English word, but are frequently pronounced. Conversely, [[Hard and soft G|soft letters]] are ignored. For example, the English word "start" used when referring to a race, is written in Katakana as ã¹ã¿ã¼ã (su-tÄ-to). The restricted nature of the Katakana set of syllables is what causes the Engrish pronunciation. The answer to this is to teach spoken English using the Latin alphabet. Many Japanese people know how to write English very well, but are not confident speakers due to this issue. It is not uncommon to receive a perfectly well-composed e-mail in English from a Japanese person, only to find that in person they will not attempt to speak English, preferring to apologise that they cannot speak, only write English.

==In popular culture==
Instances of Engrish due to poor translation were frequently found in many early video games produced in Japan, often due to the creators not having enough (or not wanting to spend enough) money for proper translations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} One well-known example of Engrish in pop culture is the translation of the video game ''[[Zero Wing]]'' which gave birth to the phenomenon [[All your base are belong to us]], which also became an [[Internet meme]]. This phenomenon is parodied in ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'',{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} in which the character [[Fawful]] speaks Engrish. In the Japanese version of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' (in which Fawful also appears as the main antagonist), in the same subseries, the character Broque Monsieur also speaks Engrish.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Engrish has been featured occasionally in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', such as the song "Let's Fighting Love", used in the episode "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", which parodies the poorly translated opening theme sequences sometimes shown in [[anime]], and in Parker and Stone's feature length ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' where the North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]] is depicted singing the song "I'm so Ronery".&lt;ref name="WP South Park"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stuever|first=Hank|title=Puppet Government 'South Park' Creators' Left Jab at Jingoism May Backfire|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34313-2004Oct15.html|accessdate=16 September 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 15, 2004|quote=The North Korean dictator speaks in the voice of "South Park's" Eric Cartman, ... only with an Engrish accent. "I'm so ronery," Kim confesses in a pitiful ballad to himself, which explains his evil-doing -- he just needs to be ruvved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British fashion brand [[Superdry]], in a reverse parody of the phenomenon, has established a style of placing meaningless Japanese text such as 'Sunglasses company' and 'membership certificate' on clothing sold in Britain. The company explained to a Japanese television crew that most translations were done using simple automatic translation programs such as [[Yahoo! Babel Fish|Babelfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdry: Popular UK Fashion Brand Uses Gibberish Japanese|url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2011/10/16/superdry-popular-uk-fashion-brand-uses-gibberish-japanese/|website=Japan Probe|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdry|url=http://www.unmissablejapan.com/etcetera/superdry|website=Unmissable Japan|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' featured a parody of the drama series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', where they portrayed the cast riding motor-scooters and speaking Engrish, thus changing the title to "Erizabeth L".

In the 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the Parker family goes to a Chinese restaurant for their Christmas dinner, and are serenaded by the waitstaff with Engrish Christmas carols, such as "[[Deck the Halls|Deck the harrs]] wis boughs of horry, fa ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra" and "[[Jingle Bells|Jingre berrs]], jingre berrs, jingre arr the way, oh what fun it is to ride in one-horse open sreigh!"&lt;ref&gt;StarWalker13 (April 26, 2009). {{YouTube | xTq20prt0K8 | "A Christmas Story Chinese Restaurant Scene"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfonso XIII, de Kaulak.jpg|thumb|King Alfonso XIII in 1915]]
The '''European War Office''' ({{lang-es|Oficina de la Guerra Europea}} or ''Oficina Pro Cautivos'') was a humanitarian office created by [[King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] to help the victims of the [[First world war|First World War]] no matter which side they fought on or whether they were civilians or military. This office depended directly from the [[Private Secretary]] of the King and had its headquarters in the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].

One of the most importants achieves that the King made was to get a compromise from both sides of the conflicts to stop sinking of more [[Hospital ship|hospital-ships]]. As a result, Spanish naval observers sailed in the hospital-ships of various countries to make sure that the ships were being used for that purpose, rather than for military expeditions.The king also cooperated in the creation of a special signal code for hospital-ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII and Spainâs Humanitarian Work|last=Gracia Rivas|first=Manuel|publisher=Revista EspaÃ±ola de Defensa|year=2014|isbn=|location=Madrid|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish neutrality==
{{Main|Spain during World War I}}
During the World War I, [[Spain]] remained neutral because of many reason, one of the most important for the King was his family ties (His wife was British and his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships). But this fact did not prevent the King from getting involved in the war, creating the European War Office.

On August 7, 1914, it was published in [[Gazeta de Madrid|Madrid's Gazette]] a Royal Decree signed by both King Alfonso and [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Eduardo Dato]] declaring the country neutral and saying that the government had the Â«duty to order the strictest neutrality to Spanish subjects in accordance with the laws in force and the principles of public international lawÂ».

For the [[Government of Spain|Government]], there was no reason to enter in the conflict and there was no enough resources to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A century of Spain: politics and society|last=JuliÃ¡|first=Santos|publisher=Marcial Pons|year=1999|isbn=84-9537903-1|location=Madrid|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that the political and economic class was agreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Liberal Spain (1868-1917)|last=SuÃ¡rez Cortina|first=Manuel|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=84-9756-415-4|location=Madrid|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King also agreed despite of having commented with the French ambassador his wish of entering in the conflict in the [[Allies of World War I|allies side]] in exchange of a Â«some tangible satisfactionÂ» âprobably referring to [[Tangier]]â.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII. The controversial king.|last=Tusell|first=Javier|last2=GarcÃ­a Queipo de Llano|first2=Genoveva|publisher=Taurus|year=2002|isbn=84-306-0449-9|location=Madrid|pages=284; 287-288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important reason for Spanish neutrality was the precariousness of its [[Spanish Armed Forces|armed forces]]. Spain was involved in numerous conflicts in the north of Africa because of its [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|protectorate of Morocco]]. This situation supposed an outdated [[Spanish Army|Army]], with bad supplies and because of the large number of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], most of the budget went to pay their salaries. The [[Spanish Navy|Navy]]'s reputation was very damaged because of the defeat in the [[Spanish-American War of 1898|American-Spanish War of 1898]] and it wasn't until a decade later when the government started again to invest in new warships, causing that the navy wasn't ready to enter into a war.

To all this we have to add the social unrest because of the growing of the labor movement and the appearance of left-wing republican parties that could cause a major conflict like happenned in the [[Russian Revolution]] if the conflict would be unfavorable to Spain.

==The Office==
[[File:1918-06-22, Heraldo de Madrid, JuliÃ¡n JuderÃ­as.jpg|thumb|JuliÃ¡n JuderÃ­as in 1918]]
The Office, with its headquarters in the Royal Palace, started around 1914 with just six staff. The publication in a french newspaper, Le Petit Girondais, a thank you letter provoked an avalanche of letters from many europeans asking for help. This forced the King to enlarge the office to 48 staff members, all of them speaking several languages and many volunteers. Among them was the historian and translator [[JuliÃ¡n JuderÃ­as]] whom spoke 15 languages.

The office worked in coordination with the [[Red Cross]] and was structurated in several sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/alfonso_xiii_king_of_spain|title=Alfonso XIII, King of Spain {{!}} International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Missing People.
*Information and Correspondence in Occupied Territories.
*Prisoners.
*Repatriations of Soldiers Severely Wounded or Sick.
*Repatriations of Civilians.
*Internment Service in Switzerland.
*Pardons.
*Commutations of Sentences.
*Remittance of Funds to Individuals and Families in Occupied Territories.
*Reports on Inspection Visits by Spanish Delegates.

The Office received more than 200,000 letters â140,000 of them from relatives of soldiersâ all of whom were answered thanks to what Juan JosÃ© Alonso MartÃ­n, director of the Palace General Archives, has described as Â«a primitive computing system.Â»&lt;ref name=ElPaÃ­s&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/08/inenglish/1541680126_698719.html|title=A king with a mission: the humanitarian deeds of Alfonso XIII during the Great War|last=Olaya|first=Vicente G.|date=2018-11-09|work=El PaÃ­s|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of the King wasn't only to find people's relatives but to stop some executions. It's calculated that around a hundred people were saved from execution thanks to this office âincluding French and German soldiersâ. The King even tried to save [[Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]] and his family with no success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-no-nation-would-rescue-nicholas-ii-and-his-family-from-revolutionary-russia/2018/08/02/bf5fcf0e-6a77-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html|title=Review {{!}} Why no nation would rescue Nicholas II and his family from revolutionary Russia|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elespanol.com/cultura/historia/20181109/espana-gran-guerra-mediador-alfonso-xiii-cataluna/351715887_0.html|title=EspaÃ±a en la Gran Guerra: del mediador Alfonso XIII a las llamas en CataluÃ±a|work=El EspaÃ±ol|access-date=2018-11-11|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace General Archives have more than 90 documents sent to [[St. Petersburg]] that proves the efforts to liberate or visit the Tsar âthe office's staff visited more than 4,000 prisoners over all Europeâ but the [[Romanovs]] were already dead by when the rescue operation started. Even this, the King was not sure of the fate of the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina]] and her children so he and his office continued trying it.&lt;ref name=ElPaÃ­s/&gt;

There is also evidence that his efforts were instrumental in lifting the siege on [[Belgium]] so that food from the [[United States]] could reach its nine million inhabitants.

=== Recognition ===
The diplomats involved in the operation received the [[Medal of French Gratitude|Reconnaissance FranÃ§aise medal]], the women received the Red Cross medal and the rest of the staff received the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|Order of Isabel the Catholic Queen]].

King Alfonso himself was thanked by the people of Belgium and [[Italy]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="ElPaÃ­s" /&gt; He was also greatly admired around the world. A young English girl even wrote this prayer which appeared in a newspaper: Â«''And God bless Father and Mother, and Nurse, and send Father back soon from his horrid prison in Germany. And God bless specially the dear King of Spain who found out about Father. Amen.Â»''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII and the War: The Mirror of Neutrals|last=EspinÃ³s MoltÃ³|first=VÃ­ctor|publisher=|year=1918|isbn=8473350057|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, King Alfonso was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but it was given to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. He was nominated again in 1933, when he was already in exile. In honor of its royal visitor, Le Meurice Hotel has a room with his name, Suite Royale Alphonse XIII, where the very famous Spanish painter [[Salvador DalÃ­]] spent one month every year for thirty years.

==Featured cases==
* French actor and singer [[Maurice Chevalier]] was taken prisoner in Germany and it was thank to the secret intervention of King Alfonso that he was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musiqueenligne.com/artist_bio.php?lg=en&amp;id=2250|title=Biography : Maurice CHEVALIER|last=comkoenig|website=www.musiqueenligne.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Royal Palace's archive exists a complaint about the bad situation of future French president [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles De Gaulle]] made by the Spanish inspectors sent by the King to a war camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/abci-alfonso-xiii-convirtio-palacio-real-oficina-esperanza-guerra-mundial-201702120111_noticia.html|title=Alfonso XIII, el Rey que convirtiÃ³ el Palacio Real en una oficina de la esperanza en la I Guerra Mundial|work=abc|access-date=2018-11-11|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With only 8-years-old, a french girl named Sylviane Sartor sent a letter to the King asking him to find her uncle that was a war prisoner and saying that that would made her mother stop crying. She said the following: Â«''Your Majesty, Mother is crying all the time because her brother has been taken prisoner. She has just received a letter that says he will die of hunger. Your Majesty, if you could send him to Switzerlandâ¦ because Mother is certainly going to make herself ill. Your Majesty, I thank you in advance. Your servant, Sylviane''Â». The King answered back that letter by asking for more information: Â«''Dear Miss, I will do my best to stop your mother from crying. So be so good as to send me exact news of your uncle so that I can take the matter further. Alfonso XIII, King.''Â» The prisioner was Achille Delmonte, found in a camp in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]] and sent back to [[Switzerland]] with his family.&lt;ref name=ElPaÃ­s/&gt;
*The French prime minister asked the King to try to get the repatriation of 20,000 French civilians that the war had surprised in the enemy zone, and that they had been deported to internment camps. Alfonso XIII achieved his liberation in a few months, and France considered him a war hero ever since.&lt;ref name=Alcelay&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alfonso XIII, el hÃ©roe de guerra olvidado|last=Alcelay|first=Carlos|publisher=mujerhoy.com|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The efforts of the office were unsuccessful in the search for John Kipling, the only son of the Nobel Prize for literature [[Rudyard Kipling]]. His remains were not found and identified until 1922.&lt;ref name=Alcelay/&gt;

==Public exhibition==
Nowadays, all these letters and documents from the European War Office are property of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] archives and it forms part of a public exhibition called ''Letters to the King. The humanitarian activities of Alfonso XIII during the Great War'' that will be open between November 8, 2018 and March 3, 2019. It can be visited in the Genoa Rooms of the Royal Palace of Madrid.

The '''Financial Stability Board''' ('''FSB''') is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the [[global financial system]]. It was established after the [[2009 G20 London summit|G20 London summit]] in April 2009 as a successor to the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (FSF). The Board includes all [[G20 major economies]], FSF members, and the [[European Commission]]. Hosted and funded by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the board is based in [[Basel, Switzerland|Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/contact/|title=Contact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Financial Stability Forum ===
{{Main|Financial Stability Forum}}

The FSB's predecessor organization, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), had emerged from a group of [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies, which had been founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability by the finance ministers and central bank governors of [[G7]] countries.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Genesis of the FSF | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141837/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions, and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;{{cite web | title = Home/News| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| date = | url = http://www.fsforum.org| archive-date = 12 May 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Who we are | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141842/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the G20 summit on 15 November 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to include members of the G20 who had not been FSF members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Financial Stability Forum decides to broaden its membership |work= |publisher=Financial Stability Forum |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2009 |format= |doi= |accessdate=30 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding ===
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28â29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm |title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. The report identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. The International Monetary Fund is working closely with sovereign wealth funds to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of sovereign wealth funds.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt; On 12 April 2008, the FSF delivered a report to the G7 Finance Ministers detailing its recommendations:&lt;ref name="FSFReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Financial Stability Forum|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm|title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum Recommends Actions to Enhance Market and Institutional Resilience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strengthen prudential oversight of capital, liquidity, and risk management
* Enhance transparency and valuation
* Change the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthen the authorities' responsiveness to risks
* Make robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system

=== 2012 reforms ===
The High-Level Panel on the Governance of the FSB was an independent initiative coordinated by [[Domenico Lombardi]] of the [[Brookings Institution]]  and funded by the [[The Connect U.S. Fund|Connect U.S. Fund]]. It assembled a high-level panel of experts, including [[Uganda]]'s former [[Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (Uganda)|Finance Minister]] and [[Governor of the Bank of Uganda|Central Bank Governor]] of Uganda [[Ezra Suruma]], former [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] [[Djoomart Otorbaev]], former [[Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia|Finance Minister]] of [[Colombia]] [[JosÃ© Antonio Ocampo]], and [[Jacques Mistral]], a former member of [[France]]'s Council of Economic Analysis.&lt;ref name="newrules"&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do: High-Level Panel on the Governance of the Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.new-rules.org/what-we-do/fsb-unlocking-the-black-box/hlp-on-fsb-governance|website=New Rules for Global Finance|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombardi published the panel's final report in September 2011 as a Brookings Issue Paper, concluding that the FSB's governance had not evolved as quickly as its prominence. It made several recommendations:&lt;ref name="brookings"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Domenico Lombardi|authorlink1=Domenico Lombardi|title=The Governance of the Financial Stability Board|date=September 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FSB_Issues_Paper_Lombardi.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2011 G20 Cannes summit]], the G20 called for a strengthening of the FSB's capacity resources and governance by establishing the FSB "on an enduring organizational basis".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.fsb.org/about/history/|website=Financial Stability Board|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2012 report to the [[2012 G20 Los Cabos summit|G20 Los Cabos summit]], the FSB set out concrete steps to strengthen the organization's capacity, resources, and governance as well as establish it on an enduring organizational footing. The G20 endorsed the FSB's restated and amended charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report to the G20 Los Cabos Summit on Strengthening FSB Capacity, Resources and Governance|date=12 June 2012|publisher=Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_120619c.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the FSB became a separate legal entity in the form of an association or "Verein" under Swiss law, when its Articles of Association were adopted by the FSB Plenary.&lt;ref name="ar4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Financial Stability Board|title=4th Annual Report|date=December 2017|publisher=Financial Stability Board|location=Basel|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB is hosted and funded by the Bank for International Settlements under a five-year agreement executed between the two in January 2013. The bank bears the majority of the FSB's operating expenses, and the FSB does not have any assets, liabilities, or revenue.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

=== 2016 reforms===

In late July 2016, after the world markets had faced a number of crises, including terrorism and the UK's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]], Carney sent a letter to Finance Ministers attending the G20 Summit and to Central Bank Governors outlining the reforms the FSB had made&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theasianbanker.com/press-releases/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsb%E2%80%99s-2016-priorities |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSBâs 2016 priorities |author= |date=24 July 2016 |website=The Asian Banker |access-date=25 July 2016 |quote=The letter outlines the progress the FSB is making in advancing its priorities for 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the global economy and financial system had "continued to function effectively" and had "weathered" the "spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion", confirming that "this resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms". He emphasized the value of specific reforms that had been implemented by the Financial Stability Board stating that these had "dampened aftershocks from [global financial crises] rather than amplifying them". He expressed confidence in the FSB's strategies, stating that "resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Szu |first=Ping Chan |date=24 July 2016 |title=G20: Chancellor eyes clarity on Brexit deal 'later this year' as vote raises global risks |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/24/g20-chancellor-eyes-clarity-on-brexit-deal-later-this-year-as-vo |work=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB published the pre-G20 summit letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsb.org/2016/07/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsbs-2016-priorities/ |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSBâs 2016 priorities |author=|date=24 July 2016 |website=FSB |publisher=FSB |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of the "two spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion" weathered by the global economy and financial system as of late July 2016, which outlined its priorities for 2016:
* Promote a coordinated program of reforms to deliver resilient sources of market-based finance, including addressing structural vulnerabilities associated with [[asset management]]
* Develop robust financial market infrastructure, including assessing policies on central counterparty resilience, recovery, and resolvability, and recommending any necessary improvements
* Support effective [[Macroprudential regulation|macroprudential]] arrangements by drawing lessons from countries that have applied macroprudential policy frameworks and tools, working in partnership with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Bank for International Settlements]]

In addition to the priorities listed above, the FSB also sought to:
* Pursue the full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, while addressing material unintended consequences
* Address new and emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with conduct, correspondent banking and climate change
* Monitor the potentially systemic implications of [[Financial technology|financial technology]] [[Financial innovation|innovations]], and the systemic risks arising from operational disruptions

In November 2016, the FSB and the board of the Bank for International Settlements agreed to a further five-year extension of the agreement from January 2018 to 2023.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

== Overview ==
The FSB represented the G20 leaders' first major international institutional innovation. [[U.S. Treasury]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] [[Tim Geithner]] has described it as "in effect, a fourth pillar" of the architecture of global economic governance. The FSB has been assigned a number of important tasks, working alongside the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]], and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Chairman of the board is the Canadian [[Mark Carney]], [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governor]] of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Carney gets chance to reshape Bank of England after departure of deputy governor|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/14/mark-carney-gets-chance-to-reshape-bank-of-england-as-deputy-governor-departs |accessdate=20 June 2013|work=[[Financial Post]]|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most multilateral financial institutions, the FSB lacks a legal form and any formal power, given that its charter is an informal and nonbinding memorandum of understanding for cooperation adopted by its members.&lt;ref name="brookings"/&gt;

=== Membership ===
The FSB has 68 member institutions, comprising ministries of finance, central banks, and supervisory and regulatory authorities from 25 jurisdictions as well as 10 international organizations and [[Standards organization|standard-setting bodies]], and 6 Regional Consultative Groups reaching out to 65 other jurisdictions around the world.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/members/links.htm |title=Links to FSB members |publisher=Financial Stability Board |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free-to-air''' ('''FTA''') are [[television]] (TV) and [[radio]] services broadcast in clear ([[Encryption|unencrypted]]) form, allowing any person with the [[FTA Receiver|appropriate receiving equipment]] to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a [[Pay television|subscription]], other ongoing cost or one-off fee (e.g. [[Pay-per-view]]). In the traditional sense, this is carried on [[Radio|terrestrial radio]] signals and received with an antenna.

FTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g. [[Cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] or the [[Internet]]. These carriers may be mandated (or opt) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts, similar to the [[1-1-2|112]] emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers.

[[Free-to-view]] (FTV) is, generally, available without [[subscription]] but is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.

Free-to-air is often used for [[international broadcasting]], making it something of a video equivalent to [[shortwave radio]].
Most FTA retailers list free to air channel guides and content available in North America for free to air use.

== Funding ==
Although commonly described as free, the cost of free-to-air services is met through various means:
* Tax payer funding
* with an enforced levy of a [[television licence|licence fee]] for transmission and production costs (e.g., the [[BBC]])
* with a voluntary donation for local transmission and production costs (e.g., [[PBS]])
* with commercial advertising for transmission and production costs and surplus revenues returned to the government (e.g., [[CBC Television]]/[[TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada]] in [[Canada]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] in Australia and [[TVNZ]] in New Zealand)
* Commercial sponsorship
* Consumer products and services where part of the cost goes toward television [[advertising]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] (in the case of Japanese television broadcasters like [[TV Asahi]] and [[TV Tokyo]] which rely heavily on sponsorship, similar to Philippine broadcasters like [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]])

== Americas ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]] the main FTA satellite is the [[Star One C2]], it holds approximately 30 C-band analog channels, including all major networks like [[Rede Globo]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de TelevisÃ£o|SBT]], [[Rede Record|Record]], [[RedeTV!]], [[Rede Bandeirantes|Band]] and others, and 5 digital [[HDTV]] channels.+itv 1

=== North America ===
There are a number of competing systems in use. Early adopters used C-band [[satellite dish|dishes]] several feet in diameter to receive analog microwave broadcasts, and later digital microwave broadcasts using the 3.7-4.2&amp;nbsp;GHz band. Today, although large C-band dishes can still receive some content, the 11.7-12.2&amp;nbsp;GHz {{Ku band}} is also used.  Ku-band signals can be received using smaller dishes, often as small as under a meter in diameter, allowing FTA satellite to be picked up from smaller spaces such as apartment balconies (note, however, that these dishes are not quite as small as those commonly used for commercial services such as Dish Network, DirecTV, Bell ExpressVu, Shaw Direct, etc.  Dishes intended for those services may not deliver an adequate signal on Ku-band). The European-developed [[DVB-S]] and [[DVB-S2]] standards are the most commonly used broadcast methods, with analog transmissions almost completely discontinued as of mid-2014.

The most common North American sources for free-to-air DVB [[satellite television]] are:
* [[NHK World]] HD on [[Intelsat 9]] (58Â°W)
* [[Retro Television Network]], [[TuffTV]] on [[AMC 9]] (83Â°W)
* [[Louisiana Public Broadcasting|LPB]] Louisiana PBS channels LPBHD, LPB2, and LPB3 (Create) on [[SES 2]] (89Â°W)
* [[NASA TV]] Multi-channel (NASA TV Public-Education, NASA Media, NASA TV UHD) on [[Horizons-1]] (aka Galaxy 13) (127Â°W)
* [[Eternal Word Television Network]] on [[Galaxy 17]] (91Â°W)
* [[My Family TV]], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]] on [[Galaxy 3C]] (95Â°W).
* [[AMGTV]] and [[BYUtv|BYU Television]] (BYUtv) on [[Galaxy 19]] (97Â°W)
* English and foreign language broadcasters [[RT (TV network)]], [[Ebru TV]], [[Islamic Republic of Iran News Network|IRINN]], [[Al Jazeera English]] and more up-linked by [[GlobeCast World TV]] on [[Galaxy 19]] (97Â°W)
* Christian broadcasters such as [[The Word Network]], [[Emmanuel TV]], [[Daystar Television Network]], [[JCTV]], [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], [[The Church Channel]], [[3ABN]], [[The Hope Channel]], [[Amazing Facts]] Television, [[God's Learning Channel]] are broadcast from the [[Galaxy 19]] (97Â°W) satellite for [[Glorystar]] and [[Spiritcast]] Satellite Systems TV.
* Peace TV English and Peace TV Urdu language which are global Islamic channels, available on Galaxy 19 (97Â°W)
* [[DoD News]] on [[AMC 1]] (103Â°W)
* [[Jewish Life Television]] on [[Galaxy 18]] (123Â°W)
* [[Montana PBS|Montana Public Broadcasting Service]] and other [[PBS Satellite Service]]s on AMC 21 (125Â°W)
* [[Classic Arts Showcase]] on [[Galaxy 17]] (91Â°W) and [[Eternal Word Television Network]] HD on [[Galaxy 15]] (133Â°W)
* Football, Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, and Hockey [[wildfeed]]s on various satellites
* Infowars and Alex Jones Show broadcasts from Austin, TX and creates free to air 24/7 content on Galaxy 16 99Â°W

Most of these signals are carried by [[United States|US]] satellites. There is little or no free Canadian DVB-S content available to users of medium-size dishes as much of the available Ku-band satellite bandwidth is occupied by [[pay-TV]] operators [[Shaw Direct]] and [[Bell TV]], although larger C-band dishes can pick up some content. FTA signals may be scattered across multiple satellites, requiring a motor or multiple [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]]s to receive everything.  This differs from Europe, where FTA signals are commonly concentrated on a few specific satellites.

Another difference between North American FTA and FTA in most of the rest of the world is that in North America, very few of the available signals are actually intended for home viewers or other end-users.  Instead, they are generally intended for reception by local television stations, cable system headends, or other commercial users.  While it is generally thought to be legal for home viewers to view such transmissions as long as they are not encrypted, this means that there are several unique challenges to viewing FTA signals that are not present in other areas of the world.  Among these are:

* No schedule information is provided with most of the signals, therefore satellite receivers cannot show a proper [[electronic program guide]] ([[EPG]]).
* Because many of these broadcasts are essentially point-to-point transmissions, the originators often do not follow any international standards when setting various identification fields in the data stream.  This causes issues with receivers and software designed for use in other parts of the world, as they may assume that if a channel contains the same ID information as another channel, those are duplicate channels.  This may be a valid assumption in other parts of the world, but is almost never valid for North American FTA signals.  When such an assumption is made, during a "blind scan" the receiver or software will often fail to correctly insert one or more channels into its database, or it may overwrite previously scanned valid channels (including other channels on the same satellite) with invalid information picked up from another, more recently scanned channel.  If the end user does not understand what is happening, they may assume that the receiver cannot receive certain channels or that it is defective, yet if the correct data for those channels can be manually entered, those channels may become receivable.  This problem can be mitigated if receivers can be set to ignore channels that appear to be duplicates during a "blind scan", except when such channels are on exactly the same satellite and same transponder frequency (as might occur if the user rescans a previously-scanned satellite).
* Channels tend to come and go, or change transmission formats, often without any prior notice other than to their intended recipients.  This means that a working channel could suddenly disappear without warning, and may need to be rescanned to become receivable again, or it may be gone permanently.
* Channels that are currently FTA can become scrambled (encrypted) with no advance warning.  A few channels tend to go back and forth between being "in the clear" (unscrambled) to scrambled at various times, but in most cases, once a channel is scrambled it stays scrambled.
* Historically, it has appeared that broadcasters are more likely to scramble their signals when they become aware that home viewers and other "unauthorized" viewers are watching their signals. Therefore, those who know what signals are available may sometimes be reluctant to share that information in open forums.  While sites exist that attempt to list currently viewable FTA signals, most of them are incomplete or do not contain current information.  Such sites typically rely on reports of changes by viewers, and if viewers are reluctant to report new FTA signals for fear they might disappear, it becomes more of a challenge for such sites to maintain up-to-date listings.
* What some would consider the most desirable signals, e.g. feeds from broadcast networks, are primarily only available on C-band, which requires a large dish (usually at least 6 feet/1.8 meters in diameter or more, although a few hobbyists have found it possible to receive some C-band signals using smaller dishes and high quality LNB's).  Also some of those signals utilize high-bitrate formats that cannot be received by many older receivers, even if those receivers are capable of receiving digital signals, and such signals may require a larger than usual dish for adequate reception.  In many areas, local zoning laws and/or homeowner associations forbid the placement of a large dish, therefore such dishes have fallen out of favor since commercial satellite services became widely available.  Therefore, very few people have the capability to receive the C-band broadcasts.  Another issue is that properly aiming a C-band dish is not something that a typical end-user would know how to do, since it tends to be a somewhat complex procedure (especially when a moveable dish is used with the intention of tracking the visible satellite arc in order to receive multiple satellites), and many of the installers that knew how to set up and correctly aim a C-band dish have exited the business.
* While equipment and software is becoming available that allows home users to set up a backend system that can deliver received over-the-air [[ATSC]] signals to several frontend systems (for example, a [[HDHomeRun]], [[VBox Home TV Gateway]] or similar TV tuner, used with [[MythTV]] or [[TVHeadEnd]]), a similar system for receiving FTA signals is considerably more difficult to set up.  While PCI/PCIe tuner cards and USB tuners for DVB-S and DVB-S2 are available, there are often issues with drivers, or the cards may simply not be compatible with the backend software in use.  Therefore, setting up such a system for FTA satellite reception tends to require considerably more technical knowledge, and a willingness to work through issues, than setting up such a system for receiving terrestrial signals.
* Some syndicated programming is being sent as data, similar to the way a video file might be sent over the Internet.  This means that the programming is not sent in a format that can be viewed in real time, as it is being received.  Instead, the data must be captured to a storage device and decoded for later use.  Traditional satellite receivers and even many PC tuner cards are not capable of receiving these signals, and even if you have a card capable of receiving such signals, you also need special software to find such data streams and when one is found, to extract the data stream and save it.

The largest groups of end-users for Ku-band free-to-air signals were initially the ethnic-language communities, as often free ethnic-language programming would be sponsored by Multilingual American Communities and their broadcasters. Depending on language and origin of the individual signals, North American ethnic-language TV is a mix of pay-TV, free-to-air and DBS operations. Today, many American broadcasters send a multitude of programming channels in many languages, spanning many new channels, so they can get National support, which ultimately leads to carriage by cable systems, to additionally support the high costs of broadcasting signals in this way.

Nevertheless, free-to-air satellite TV is a viable addition to home video systems, not only for the reception of specialized content but also for use in locations where terrestrial [[ATSC]] over-the-air reception is incomplete and additional channels are desired.

[[Australia]] has five major free-to-air networks: [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]], and [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS). Traditionally each network had only a single channel in a geographic area, though with the advent of digital television each network now has [[SD video|SD]] multichannels [[7TWO]], [[7mate]], [[7flix]], [[9Go!]], [[9Gem]], [[9Life]], [[10 Boss]], [[10 Peach]], [[SBS Viceland]] and [[SBS Food]] respectively, and one [[High-definition television|HD]] networks simulcasting [[ABC HD (Australian TV channel)|ABC HD]], [[7HD]], [[9HD]], [[10 HD]] and [[SBS HD]] respectively. With the exception of SBS, each commercial broadcaster also has one SD [[datacasting]] channel: [[Your Money (TV channel)|Your Money]], [[TVSN]] and [[Spree TV]] respectively; SBS instead broadcasts [[National Indigenous Television|NITV]] free-to-air. The ABC is exempt from the policy limiting the number of multichannels, and currently runs three SD channels [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], [[ABC Comedy]], [[ABC ME]], [[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]], and a primary channel which is simulcast on both analogue and digital. ABC and SBS channels are available across Australia; outside the major capital cities, regional affiliates provide channels that are essentially identical to the metropolitan commercial channels. In addition, [[Community television in Australia|community television]] provides one channel in some major cities.

Australia's two main [[Public Broadcasting|government-owned TV channels]], the ABC and SBS, along with the digital-only multichannels ABC Comedy, ABC ME and SBS Viceland, are both available free-to-air on the [[Optus D1]] satellite. Viewers in remote parts of Australia could also access [[Seven Central]] and [[Imparja Television]], or [[WIN WA]] and [[GWN7]] in [[Western Australia]], through the DVB-S [[free-to-view]] [[Optus Aurora]] service, which was replaced in December 2013 with the DVB-S2 free-to-view Optus [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] service.

Other satellite-only channels such as [[Expo Channel|Expo]], [[Press TV]] and [[Al Jazeera English]] are available free-to-air on various satellites.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|List of free-to-air television stations in New Zealand}}
New Zealand has a number of FTA broadcasters such as [[Television New Zealand]]'s [[TVNZ 1]] and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]], as well as [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]'s [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] and [[C4 (TV channel)|FOUR]], [[Sky Network Television]]'s [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime]] and the government subsidised the [[MÄori Television]] and [[Te Reo (TV channel)|Te Reo]] channels.

Four channels, TV One, TV2, TV3, FOUR are also broadcast timeshifted by +1 hour on Freeview and Sky platforms.

A broadcast of parliament and a number of local channels, such as [[Cue TV]] are also available. Local stations such as [[Canterbury Television|CTV]] and Face TV (previously Triangle TV) were free-to-air analogue PAL transmissions prior to CTV migrating to the free-to-air digital DVB-T service and Face TV's terrestrial free-to-air service shutoff from December 2013.

A digital terrestrial version of Freeview was launched in 2008, which, unlike the analogue and free-to-air satellite options, supports [[high-definition television|high-definition]] broadcasts for TV One, 2 and 3.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the largest and most dominant television channel, [[Television Broadcasts Limited]], was the first free-to-air commercial television channel when it commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967. It may also well be among the oldest and first station to broadcast over-the-air in East and Southeast Asia.

===South Korea===
In Korea, [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] (the 2 main public broadcasters), [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] (privately owned, but available for free to viewers), and [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]] (including both [[TV]] and [[radio]]) are the free-to-air broadcasting stations. They dominate more than 80% of advertisement profits, according to the recent survey from the agency {{ambiguous|date=May 2017}}.
Due to the recent government's {{which|date=May 2017}} decision, [[digital television]] service for all free-to-air networks would be scheduled before the year 2012, followed by the end of analog television broadcasting.

===India and South Asia===
{{See also|Television in India}}
Around 600 FTA television channels and 180 Radio Channel are broadcast from ku-band and c-band transponders on the [[INSAT-4B]] and [[GSAT-15]] satellite covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and parts of Afghanistan, China, and Myanmar. In India, the channels are marketed as [[DD Direct Plus]]/ [[DD Free Dish]] by [[Doordarshan]], India's national broadcaster and other Indian private broadcaster [[ABS Free Dish]] from the ABS2 satellite, one can receive free-to-air regional TV channels using small DTH antenna and freetoair set-top box.

===Middle East and North Africa===
{{empty section|date=May 2017}}

===Israel===
Up until 2012, Israel had several free-to-air channels, the major ones rating-wise: [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]], [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]], and [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]]. The other ones were [[Israeli Educational Television|Channel 23]], [[Channel 33 (Israel)|Channel 33]], and [[Knesset Channel|Channel 99]].

== Europe ==
=== Satellite ===
{{See also|List of free-to-air channels at 28Â°E}}
European countries have a tradition of most television services being free to air. Germany, in particular, receives in excess of 100 digital satellite TV channels free to air. Approximately half of the television channels on [[SES Astra]]'s [[Astra 19.2Â°E|19.2Â° east]] and [[Astra 28.2Â°E|28.2Â° east]] satellite positions, and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Hot Bird]] (13Â° east) are free-to-air.

A number of European channels which one might expect to be broadcast free-to-air - including many countries' national terrestrial broadcasters - do not do so ''via satellite'' for [[copyright]] reasons. (Rights to purchase programs for free-to-air broadcast, especially via satellite, are often higher in price than for encrypted broadcast.) However, these channels usually provide a scheme to offer free, but encrypted, viewing with [[free-to-view]] broadcasts. Certain programming on Italy's [[RAI]], and the majority of Dutch channels are covered by such schemes (although in the case of RAI some programming is transmitted without encryption where there are no copyright issues). In [[Austria]], the main national networks broadcast free-to-view via satellite; however, all regional and some smaller channels are transmitted free-to-air, and the national public broadcaster, [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], offers a special free-to-air channel which airs selected programming without (i.e. those without copyright issues) via satellite all over Europe.

As Germany and Austria speak the same language and use the same satellite, Austrian viewers are able to receive about 120 free German-speaking channels from both countries.

In general, all [[satellite radio]] in Europe is free to air, but the more conventional broadcast systems in use mean that [[SiriusXM]] style in-car reception is not possible.

Cable and satellite distribution allow many more channels to carry sports, movies and specialist channels which are not broadcast as FTA. The viewing figures for these channels are generally much lower than the FTA channels.

=== Terrestrial ===
Various European countries broadcast a large number of channels via free-to-air [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]], generally as an analog [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] transmission, digital [[DVB-T]]/[[DVB-T2|T2]] or a combination of the two.

==== France ====
{{main article|television in France}}
In France, there are twenty six national television channels (MPEG-4 HD video) and 41 local television channels broadcast free-to-air via the TNT DVB-T service.

==== Germany ====
{{main article|television in Germany#terrestrial}}
In Germany there are various free-to-air DVB-T services available, the number of which varies by region. [[Das Erste]], [[ZDF]], [[ZDFneo]], [[ZDFinfo]], [[3sat]], [[Arte]], [[KiKA]] and [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]] are available throughout the country, in addition to at least one region-dependent channel which is provided by the regional [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] member. Additionally, ARD's [[EinsFestival]], [[EinsPlus]] and [[tagesschau24]] are variously available in some parts of the country, and various commercial channels are available in metropolitan areas.

==== Ireland ====
{{main article|Saorview}}
In the Republic of Ireland, there are nine television channels and 11 radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Saorview service. Analog PAL versions of some of the channels were also broadcast until October 24, 2012, when all analogue television broadcasting was shut down.

==== Netherlands ====
{{main article|television in the Netherlands}}
In the Netherlands, 3 national public television channels [[NPO 1]], [[NPO 2]] and [[NPO 3]], and 7 national public radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T [[Digitenne]] service. The television and radio channels of the regional public broadcasters are also free-to-air via the DVB-T service.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{main article|Freeview (UK)|List of digital terrestrial television channels (UK)}}
In the UK, around 220 free-to-air television channels and 25 free-to-air radio channels are available terrestrially via the Freeview DVB-T service. Seven HD channels are also broadcast via a public service broadcast multiplex and a commercial multiplex, both DVB-T2.

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, nine channels are as of 2018 free-to-air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digi-tv.dk/Indhold_og_tilbud/|title=Digi TV|website=digi-tv.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;, distributed via 18 main transmitter sites and 30 smaller, auxiliary transmitters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digi-tv.dk/Indhold_og_tilbud/frekvenser.asp|title=Digi TV|website=digi-tv.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The nine channels ([[DR1]], [[DR2]], [[DR3]], [[DR Ultra]], [[DR Ramasjang]], [[DR K]], [[Folketinget]], TV2 Regionerne, and sign language/local programme) come in two [[DVB-T2]] [[Multiplex_(television)|MUX]]es.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9447">The '''Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia''' exists to raise global awareness about the deadly toll of the number 1 killer of children - pneumonia. Every year 155 million children under 5 get sick and 1.6 million lose their lives to pneumonia, more than all child deaths combined from AIDS, malaria and measles.  Almost all of these child deaths occur in developing countries with most concentrated in just seven - India, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudan I, Boschi-Pinto C, Biloglav Z, Mulholland K, Campbell H |title=Epidemiology and etiology of childhood pneumonia |journal=Bull.

Children die from pneumonia despite the existence of vaccines that can prevent the leading causes of pneumonia and cost-effective antibiotics that can treat children who are sick.  The Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia is working to save millions of lives through protecting children against pneumonia with proper nutrition through exclusive breastfeeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth DE, Caulfield LE, Ezzati M, Black RE |title=Acute lower respiratory infections in childhood: opportunities for reducing the global burden through nutritional interventions |journal=Bull.

[http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/documents/9789241596336/en/ WHO] and UNICEF estimate that these interventions, combined with others, could save 1 million children's lives every year taking the world one big step closer to achieving [[Millennium Development Goals]].

==World Pneumonia Day==
Pneumonia has been overshadowed as a priority on the global health agenda, and rarely receives coverage in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nicholas D. Kristof |title=Pssst. Pneumonia. Pass it on |url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/pssst-pneumonia-pass-it-on/ |work=Blog: On the Ground |publisher=New York Times |date=March 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, the Global Coalition against Child Pneumonia is raising a collective voice to renew the global fight against pneumonia by holding [[World Pneumonia Day]] every year.   It will provide an annual forum for the world to stand together and demand action in the fight against pneumonia. The first World Pneumonia Day was held on November 2, 2009 and in 2010 World Pneumonia Day falls on November 12.  World Pneumonia Day will help bring this health crisis to the publicâs attention and will encourage policy makers and grass roots organizers alike to combat the disease.

'''''Global Spin: The Corporate Assault on Environmentalism''''' is a book by Professor [[Sharon Beder]]. It was first published in 1997 and there have been subsequent updated editions in 2000 and 2002. The book uses many detailed case studies to build up a "bigger picture" of how [[multinational corporations|large corporations]] attempt to manipulate [[environmental issues]] for their own ends. In the first edition most of the material was from the United States, where the corporate environmental impact has been greatest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards, David|date=November 1997|title=Global Spin review|url=|journal=The Ecologist|volume= 27| issue = 6|pages=251â2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myers|first=Allen|date=1997|title=Diagnosing the methods of spin doctors|url=|journal=Green Left Weekly|volume=229|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Globalism''' refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. The term is used by detractors of [[globalization]] such as [[right-wing populist]] movements. While primarily associated with [[world-system]]s, other things with global reach have also been so described.

Historically, it has been associated with international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and also sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of "[[nation building]]" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1992 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.

== Definitions and interpretations ==
[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines ''globalism'', "at least in its more specific use, ... as the dominant ideology and [[subjectivity]] associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.

Alternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.&lt;ref name="Nye 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x | volume=9 | title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory | journal=International Studies Review | pages=173â196 | last1 = Martell | first1 = Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).

During the election and presidency of United States president [[Donald Trump]], Trump and members of his administration used the term ''globalist'' on multiple occasions. Critics claimed that the administration used the term as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Dog-whistle politics|"dog whistle"]] term referring to members of a [[New antisemitism#Anti-globalization movement|Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/globalism-right-trump.html|title=Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump|last=Stack|first=Liam|date=14 November 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/04/06/news-opinion/politics/stephen-bannon-called-jared-kushner-a-globalist-heres-why-the-term-makes-some-jews-uneasy|title=Stephen Bannon reportedly called Jared Kushner a âglobalist.â Hereâs why the term makes some Jews uneasy.|last=Sales|first=Ben|date=6 April 2017|website=www.jta.org|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/759476/mick-mulvaney-throws-antisemitic-dog-whistle-into-fond-farewell-message-gary-cohn|title=Mick Mulvaney throws an 'anti-Semitic dog whistle' into his fond farewell message to Gary Cohn|last=Weber|first=Peter|date=7 March 2018|work=The Week|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bannon-s-revenge-how-globalism-went-mainstream-ideology-far-right-ncna860221|title=Opinion {{!}} Brian Levin: How globalism became a dirty word in the Trump White House (and America)|last=Levin|first=Brian|date=1 April 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-anti-semitic-globalist-koch-1052375|title=Donald Trump keeps calling adversaries "globalists," despite warnings it's anti-Semitic|last=Goodkind|first=Nicole|date=1 August 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
The word itself came into widespread usage, first and foremost in the United States, from the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ''globalism'' in American-English corpus, 1800â2000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=17&amp;smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 24 October 2014 }}&lt;p&gt;Compare this with ''globalism'' in the [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=18&amp;smoothing=0 British-English corpus], where its appearance is later and much more muted.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history.&lt;ref name="Leffler 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|2010|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]'s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] put it in February 1948: "[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. [â¦] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity".&lt;ref name="DoS 524"&gt;{{Harvnb|DoS|1948|p=[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2.p0034 524]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; America's allies and foes in [[Eurasia]] were suffering the dreadful effects of World War II at this time.

In their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|Kolko|1972|p=}}.&lt;p&gt;One American historian has gone as far as to describe this particular American version of globalism as ''visionary'', in order to highlight its potently ideological natureâindeed, "Washington's most impressive Cold War ideological achievement". Visionary globalism was a far-reaching conception of "American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking". And "integrating everything" crucially meant global ''economic'' integration, which had collapsed under the blows of World War I and the Great Depression. ({{Harvnb|Peck|2006|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the United States to use the term ''[[economic integration]]'' in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) did so at this time: one John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Treasury Department, towards the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Machlup 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, ''economic integration'' was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches.&lt;ref name="Machlup 11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul G. Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]], then head of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]], made the most marked use of the term in a 1949 speech to the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].&lt;ref name="Machlup 11" /&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' put it,

{{Quote| Mr Hoffmann used the word 'integration' fifteen times or almost once to every hundred words of his speech. It is a word that rarely if ever has been used by European statesmen having to do with the Marshall Plan to describe what should happen to Europe's economies. It was remarked that no such term or goal was included in the commitments the European nations gave in agreeing to the Marshall Plan. Consequently it appeared to the Europeans that "integration" was an American doctrine that had been superimposed upon the mutual engagements made when the Marshall Plan began&amp;nbsp;â¦&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Veseth|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8u99zWdAElUC&amp;pg=PA170 170â1]}}, where the ''Times'' article is reprinted.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While ideologies of the global have a long history, globalism emerged as a dominant set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of [[globalization]] intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In their recent writings, [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Steger|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hands Off the People of Iran''' (HOPI) is a political organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] founded in 2007, closely associated with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]]. It is opposed to [[Opposition to military action against Iran|Western military intervention in Iran]], as well as to the sitting Iranian government, and supports "internal" regime change. The three most prominent figures are 
Mike Macnair, the Israeli [[MoshÃ© Machover]] and [[Yassamine Mather]], an Iranian associated with the [[Workers Left Unity â Iran]]. It was denied affiliation with the [[Stop the War Coalition]] due to questions raised over its support for regime change.

==Formation==

The initiative for Hands Off the People of Iran came from a number of Iranian exile organisations in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopoi.org/whoweare.html Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2006, [[Workers Left Unity - Iran]] wrote an open letter to the British [[anti-war movement]], calling for genuine solidarity with the Iranian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/616/iran%20workers%20unity.htm Open letter to the anti war movement]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 HOPI was fully established, consisting predominantly of Iranian exiles who campaign for regime change in Iran but are against external military intervention, believing [[military occupation]] to be the worst condition under which liberation can be achieved.  HOPI's founding conference was held in December 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

At the Founding Conference, a National Steering Committee was established consisting of seventeen members from a range of different political organisations and political traditions. These include members of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]], [[Jewish Socialist Group]], [[Permanent Revolution Tendency|Permanent Revolution]], [[Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]], [[Workers Left Unity - Iran]], Revolutionary Workers of Iran, [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]] (pc) and Womenâs Campaign Against All Misogynist Laws in Iran.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

An Irish branch of HOPI, chaired by Anne McShane, organised a protest outside the Iranian Embassy in Dublin in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0618/breaking22.htm|title=Iranians set for protest in Dublin|last=MAC CORMAIC|first=RUADHÃN|work=Irish Times|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/ireland/dublin-march-for-political-change-in-iran-416527.html|title=Dublin march for political change in Iran|date=27 June 2009|work=Ireland Online|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/jun/28/hundreds-attend-iran-support-rally/|title=Hundreds attend Iran support rally|date=28 June 2009|work=Sunday Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-07}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion from Stop the War Coalition==

Shortly before [[STWC|Stop the War Coalition]]'s 2007 AGM, HOPI, alongside another organisation [[Communist Students (Autonomous)|Communist Students]], was denied affiliation with the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/antiwar-activists-do-battle-over-intervention-in-iran-399450.html|title=Anti-war activists do battle over intervention in Iran|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|date=8 November 2007|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliates and Supporters==
Prominent affiliates or supporters of HOPI include the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/record_of_decisions/2008/affiliations.cfm|title=Affiliations|year=2008|work=Public and Commercial Services Union|accessdate=2009-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127220307/http://pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/record_of_decisions/2008/affiliations.cfm|archivedate=2010-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASLEF]], the train drivers' union and [[Peter Tatchell]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/iransantiarabracism|title=Iran's anti-Arab racism|last=Tatchell|first=Peter|date=26 October 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe what he views as an emerging new era of economies and economics based on ideas, innovation, and creativity, which he sees as replacing economies which are based on the possession of [[natural resources]]. The word "indigo" was initially chosen based on the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.

He describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is "a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer [[resource rent]] but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt; But, according to Fridman â based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns â it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.

In late 2016 LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere [[GDP]] as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to "stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt;

==Indigo Era==
The economic term "Indigo Era" was publicized in early 2016 by [[Mikhail Fridman]], the co-founder of the international investment business [[LetterOne]].&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He used the term to describe the new economic era based on ideas, innovation, and creativity â which he theorizes is replacing the previous era which he sees as defined by the struggle for [[natural resources]] and land that contains them, and which is measured by [[GDP]]. The word "indigo" was adopted from the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.&lt;ref name=realclear&gt;Fridman, Mikhail.

''[[Times of Israel]]''. 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' website adds that the indigo symbolism "embodies a breaking of the norm, something that is highly reflective of the new era that we are entering into, one that lacks convention and is driven by innovation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/symbolism-of-indigo/ "Symbolism of Indigo"].

In an April 2016 article in ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', retitled and reprinted in May 2016 in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', and reprinted in November 2016 under the original title in LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal, Fridman wrote:

===Analysis===
In a series of articles published in 2016, Fridman cites the recent extreme volatility in markets,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; and worldwide political change and instability,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; as signs of an emerging global shift.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya/mir/319431-pokolenie-indigo-vkhod-svobodnyi "ÐÐ¾ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð¸Ð½Ð´Ð¸Ð³Ð¾. ÐÑÐ¾Ð´ ÑÐ²Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð´Ð½ÑÐ¹"] (in Russian). ''[[Forbes]]''. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admission&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/the-indigo-generation-admission-free/ "The Indigo Generation. Admission Free"]. ABH Holdings. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; He notes two frequently cited prominent indicators of an economic shift: the sharp decline in prices of natural resources including oil, and the slowing of China's economic growth despite this decline in the cost of natural resources.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/fundamentals-of-a-strong-economy/ "Fundamentals of a strong economy"]. ABH Holdings. 30 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

He and other commentators also note the rise of populism and populist leaders and candidates, both right-wing and left-wing, as these changes occur.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;[[Stanley Greenberg|Greenberg, Stanley]]. [http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/we-need-a-new-progressive-era-of-renewal/ "We Need a New Progressive Era of Renewal"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Meanwhile, companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] â digital and technological companies he calls "Indigo companies" â have replaced longterm traditional natural-resource or manufacturing companies such as [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] as the world's largest companies.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;

Fridman observes that throughout history innovations, alternatives, and technologies have always overcome any perceived shortages of any natural resource.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt; He therefore posits that the new "Indigo era", fueled by digital and technological resources, will be marked by a shift away from the struggle for natural resources and their perceived scarcity, to a reliance on ideas, innovation, and creativity and on supporting the intellectual and creative potential of each human being:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; "The world has entered a new era where the source of a nation's wealth is no longer natural resources. Intellectual capacity has now replaced land, raw materials and trade routes as the biggest source of wealth."&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;

According to Fridman, three interconnected factors are needed for successful Indigo companies and an Indigo economy:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;
*intuitive individual talent and a high level of education, plus the ability to form a team of equally educated and gifted people 
*a sophisticated and complex ecosystem, which includes not only legal systems that protect physical and intellectual property rights and protection from takeover by larger companies, but also  thousands of suppliers and subcontractors to supply high-quality services which range from venture capital to marketing to web design and other technologies and services
*a global digital infrastructure to distribute new products and accumulate customer data and customer-behavior insight

He notes that most emerging economies have focused on building physical structures (roads, buildings, cities, physical infrastructure) rather than the complex legal, political, and social systems, institutions, and changes that will support an effective free and innovative intellectual-resource economy.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; The freedoms, protections, and political and legal frameworks of developed Western countries rest on centuries-long histories, socio-political traditions, and mindsets, and therefore will be difficult to replicate quickly in emerging economies.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman singles out India as an emerging country that has adequate legal infrastructure and freedom to probably survive the Indigo shift.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

Fridman considers the growth of Indigo economies to be a paradigm shift; he states that the pace at which technology is developing is creating worldwide tectonic shifts, and predicts huge global change over the next five to ten years.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He and other analysts predict that the growing economic gap between free, creative economies and groups in contrast to repressive, authoritarian, totalitarian, or tradition-bound economies or groups will widen and create resentment and hostilities â whether this is between nations or within nations.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/editorial/ "Editorial"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Those left behind may be either emerging countries, or the average person â as opposed to the intellectual elites â within developed Western countries.&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

Authoritarian leaders and authoritarianism often rise during periods of uncertainty and insecurity and economic deprivation.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman maintains however that in this ever-changing new economic era, the main source of wealth in a country or region will no longer be a natural resource, but a social infrastructure that will allow everyone to realise their intellectual and creative potential.&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;&lt;ref name=forsal/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt; Therefore, he asserts that "The future Indigo economy is an economy of free people. And this means that the world will become more and more free."&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

In November 2016 [[LetterOne]] launched a journal, ''Global Perspectives'', as a platform to explore "the new emerging economic era, the Indigo era, from different perspectives, including education, religion, politics, economics, history and business" and to examine "global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letterone.com/insight/the-global-perspectives-journal "The Global Perspectives Journal examines global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world"].

The '''International Metalworkers' Federation''' ('''IMF''') was a [[global union federation]] of [[metalworking|metalworkers']] [[trade union]]s, founded in [[ZÃ¼rich]], [[Switzerland]] in August 1893. As of 2009, the IMF had more than 200 member organisations in 100 countries, representing a combined membership of 25 million workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = For a strong international labour movement
| url = http://www.imfmetal.org/index.cfm?n=616&amp;l=2
| accessdate = 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federation was founded as the '''International Metallurgists' Bureau of Information''', becoming the "International Metalworkers' Federation" in 1904.  From 1921, its constitution called for not only international co-operation to improve wages and conditions, but also for workers to take over the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name="docherty"&gt;James C. Docherty and Sjaak van der Velden, ''Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor'', p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the federation reached 1.9 million in 1930, but fell to only 190,000 in 1938, hit by the international depression.  By 1947, membership had reached a new high of 2.7 million, and the federation took a leading role in opposing the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], instead becoming a founding constituent of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]].&lt;ref name="docherty" /&gt;

The organization held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established the broad lines of the IMF's policies and actions and elected the President and General Secretary of the IMF.

The international headquarters of IMF was based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There were regional offices in [[Johannesburg]], [[New Delhi]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Mexico City]], and a project office in [[Russia]].

In June 2012, the IMF merged into the new global federation [[IndustriALL Global Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2008 as the '''International Year of Languages''', pursuant to a resolution of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES61266_page4"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-61-266 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=61 |resolution_number=266 |highlight=rect_189,1007_828,1088 |page=4 |accessdate=2008-09-18|date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution also reaffirmed the need to achieve full parity among the six official languages on United Nations websites.

==Origination==
The Year was intended to address issues of [[natural language#Linguistic diversity|linguistic diversity]] (in the context of [[cultural diversity]]), respect for all languages, and [[multilingualism]]. The resolution also discussed language issues in the United Nations itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalreference.com/DC_articles/Langdeath20.pdf Crystal. David. 2007.

[[UNESCO]] was charged with coordinating observance of the Year, and officially launched it on the occasion of [[International Mother Language Day]], 21 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080815165332/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35559&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, "Message from Mr KoÃ¯chiro Matsuura, Director-General of UNESCO, on the celebration of 2008, International Year of Languages," Date Added: 2007-11-05 9:44 am; Updated: 2007-12-19 2:40 pm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observances==
In addition to official events run by UNESCO, various national, academic and non-governmental organizations sponsored events, websites, and other observances of the IYL. The UNESCO website has a [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35835&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html list of projects] submitted by individuals and organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">The year 2008 was declared the '''International Year of the Potato''' by the [[United Nations]], noting that the [[potato]] is a staple food in the diet of the worldâs population, and affirming the need to focus world attention on the role that the potato can play in providing [[food security]] and eradicating [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES60191_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-60-191 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=60 |resolution_number=191 |highlight=rect_230,647_688,680 |page=1 |accessdate=2007-11-18|date=22 December 2005|title=International Year of the Potato, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] was invited to facilitate its implementation.

The corresponding resolution adopted on 25 November 2005 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], which was to facilitate the implementation of the year, affirmed "the need to revive public awareness of the relationship that exists between [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[malnutrition]] and the potential contribution of the potato to defeating hunger."

This was one of many [[international observances]] declared for specific days, months and years.  The year 2008 was shared with the [[International Year of Sanitation]].

It was hoped that International Year designation will do for the potato what the [[International Year of Rice]] (2004) did for that food staple, namely, inspire exhibits, educational programs, films, publications and greater public awareness of multi-national efforts on behalf of our food resources. The year 2008 was also designated the National Year of the Potato in [[Peru]].

Several functions and events were held throughout the world, including those by the [[United Nations Association in Canada]], honouring [[Wallace McCain]], co-founder of [[McCain Foods Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-62-PV.15 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=62 |meeting=15 |page=32 |anchor=pg032-bk02-pa23 |date=2 October 2007 |speakername=Mr. GutiÃ©rrez Reinel | speakernation=Peru |accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ipas''' is a global [[non-profit organization]] that works to increase women's ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, and to end deaths and injuries from unsafe [[abortion]]. Ipas's work is grounded in the belief that women everywhere must have the opportunity to determine their futures, care for their families and manage their fertility. Through local, national and global partnerships, they work to ensure that women receive safe, respectful and comprehensive abortion care, including counselling and contraception, to prevent future unwanted pregnancies.

==Scope of work==
Ipas works to improve women's access and right to safe [[abortion]] care and [[reproductive health]] services by:

* Training doctors, nurses, and midwives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20638991|year=2010|author1=Akiode|first1=A|title=An evaluation of a national intervention to improve the postabortion care content of midwifery education in Nigeria|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|volume=110|issue=2|pages=186â90|last2=Fetters|first2=T|last3=Daroda|first3=R|last4=Okeke|first4=B|last5=Oji|first5=E|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in clinical and counseling skills for abortion, postabortion care and [[family planning]];

=== Abortion in Nigeria ===
In 2017, Ipas (Nigeria), called for a review of Nigeria's law criminalising abortion in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/ipas-calls-review-law-abortion/|title=Vanguard Article on Nigeria's Abortion Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a workshop covering Womanâs Reproductive Health and Rights in Abuja, Nigeria, Ipas's Country Director spoke out about the issue, saying "Any law that does not recognise or reflect the true situation of the country is a dead law."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; foegal  

==History==
Ipas was founded in 1973, following the passage of the Helms Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID | USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits use of U.S. foreign aid to support abortion services overseas. Ipas began manufacturing and distributing manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) instruments in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalstudentsforchoice.org/uploads/UpdateNewsletter/The%20Ipas%20MVA%20Plus%20%E2%80%93%20An%20Advancement%20in%20Technology-April%202002.doc Medical Students for Choice | The Ipas MVA Plus â An Advancement in Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Ipas launched the postabortion family planning initiative in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2910603.html Guttmacher Institute | Essential Elements of Postabortion Care: Origins, Evolution and Future Directions]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Ipas created, defined and implemented the concept of "woman-centered comprehensive abortion care".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipas.org/Publications/What_is_woman-centered_comprehensive_abortion_care.aspx?ht=what%20is%20woman%20centered%20comprehensive%20abortion%20care%20what%20is%20woman%20centered%20comprehensive%20abortion%20care Ipas | What is woman-centered comprehensive abortion care?]&lt;/ref&gt; Ipas University, a self-paced online learning site for reproductive health care providers, launched in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipasu.org/home/ IpasU]&lt;/ref&gt; Womancare Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ipas, also launched in 2009, to market and distribute the MVA instruments, as well as a number of other reproductive-health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womancareglobal.com/ WomanCare Global]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 Ipas had offices in 13 countries and serves 40 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipas.org/Where_Ipas_Works.aspx Ipas | Where Ipas Works]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Not Yet Rain'' (2009) is a documentary film about abortion in Ethiopia, produced by filmmaker Lisa Russell and Ipas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministing.com/archives/015924.html Feministing | Not Yet Rain: A new documentary about abortion access in Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese people who conserve Article 9''' are a group of people who were among the favourites to win the [[2014 Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Rheana|title=Home&gt; International 2014 Nobel Peace Prize Contenders|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/2014-nobel-peace-prize-contenders/story?id=26083056|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]]|date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karimi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karimi|first1=Faith|title=Nobel Peace Prize: And the winner could be ...|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/09/world/europe/nobel-peace-prize-predictions/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] is the section of the Japanese constitution that states:

{{blockquote|ARTICLE 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. To accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Protest==
Over the years, there have been different attempts to change or abolish Article 9, which was adopted in 1947. [[ShinzÅ Abe]], Prime Minister of Japan since late 2012, is a supporter of making  Article 9 less restrictive. In January 2013, [[Naomi Takasu]] from [[Zama, Kanagawa]] emailed the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] to promote Article 9 as a means to protect children. She tried to get Article 9 itself nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but since she didn't have the time to organise protests, she campaigned from home, by email. Joined by other people from Zama and from [[Sagamihara]], she formed the "Organizing Committee for the Nobel Peace Prize for Article 9 of the Constitution.", which by August 2013 had gathered 24,000 signatures to support the nomination.&lt;ref name=Kyodo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo|first1=Jiji|title=How Japanâs Article 9 was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/07/national/japans-article-9-nominated-nobel-peace-prize/#.VDe81leDy8A|accessdate=10 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving the petition, the Committee replied that the Prize can only be awarded to people or organizations, disqualifying the Article 9 nomination. Takasu then changed the nomination to be about the Japanese people who want to keep Article 9.&lt;ref name=Kyodo/&gt; Since not everyone can make nominations for the Prize, she couldn't officially nominate the group herself. A number of Japanese professors with the right qualifications supported her cause and submitted the revised nomination.&lt;ref name=Japanfs&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 9 of Japan's Constitution Nominated for Nobel Peace Award|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/news/archives/news_id034940.html|website=www.japanfs.org|publisher=Japan for Sustainability|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has continued to grow in Japan and receive support from all over the world. By June 2014, about 80,000 people had signed the petition.&lt;ref name=Japanfs/&gt; Notable members include [[YÅichi Komori]], professor at the [[University of Tokyo]] and leader of the group ''Kyujo no Kai'' ("Association of Article 9"). Political reactions to the group and the chances of a Nobel Prize for it have been mixed.&lt;ref name=Kyodo/&gt;

==2014 Nobel Peace Prize speculation==
In the days running up to the announcement of the [[2014 Nobel Peace Prize]], there was widespread speculation that the so-called "Japanese people who conserve Article 9" group were favourites to win the prize. In the end, the winners were [[Kailash Satyarthi]] from India and [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan. 

The speculation about their chances was fueled when [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], director of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], who each year announces his shortlist of favourites for the prize, named the group as his tip for 2014 in his revised list, posted 3 October 2014.&lt;ref name=Harpviken&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harpviken|first1=Kristian Berg|title=Harpviken's 2014 Nobel Peace Prize shortlist|url=http://www.prio.org/About/PeacePrize/PRIO-Directors-Speculations-2014/|website=www.prio.org|publisher=[[Peace Research Institute Oslo]]|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of proposed state mergers''', including both current and historical proposals originating from sovereign states or organizations. The entities listed below differ from [[List of active separatist movements|separatist movements]] in that they would form as a merger or union of two or more existing [[Sovereign state|states]], [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]], [[colony|colonies]] or other regions, becoming either a [[federation]], [[confederation]] or other type of unified [[sovereign state]].

|Part of the [[Kashmir conflict]]. Both India and Pakistan claim the former princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], leading to the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1947]]. A UN-mediated ceasefire put a halt to the conflict in January 1949. The UN resolution called for both the countries to demilitarise the region, following which a plebiscite would be held. However, no demilitarisation plan acceptable to both the countries could be agreed. The countries fought two further wars in [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971]]. Following the latter war, the countries reached the [[Simla Agreement]], agreeing on a [[Line of Control]] between their respective regions and committing to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through [[India-Pakistan relations|bilateral negotiations]]. An [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|armed insurgency]] broke out in 1989 in the Indian administered part of Kashmir, demanding "independence". Pakistan is [[Pakistan and state sponsored terrorism|believed to provide arms]] and training to the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;

| Syrian territory captured by Israel in 1967 (the Six-Day War), and unilaterally annexed by Israel in 1981. In 2008, a plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly voted by 161â1 in favor of a motion on the "occupied Syrian Golan" that reaffirmed support for UN Resolution 497; United Nations, December 5, 2008). During the Syrian civil war period, Syrian Arab Republic had lost direct control of the Eastern Golan areas and retreated from cease-fire line with Israel (in favor of various rebel and Jihadist groups), though did regain the area in 2018.

| The conflict arose in 2003 when the Russian authorities started to build a dam towards the island. Since then Ukraine established a border garrison on the island for a closer surveillance. The reason for the conflict is the fact that Tuzla island's strategic location gives Ukraine full rights over the main channel in the Strait of Kerch and, thus, the access to the [[Sea of Azov]]. The conflict is based on the division of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and a lease agreement of the Sevastopol Naval facilities.

==Antarctica==
{{further|Territorial claims of Antarctica}}
The [[Antarctic Treaty System]], formed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of [[Antarctica]] and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings. It prevents new territorial claims of all signatories (except U.S and Russia) for as long as the treaty is in force. However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time. Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the [[United Nations]]. Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any (non-signatory) state can still lay claim to as [[terra nullius]] (on the grounds of it not having been part of any existing state's legal and effective territory).

| Following [[Partition of Bengal (1947)]], the issues of adverse possessions, enclaves and unmarked boundary arose. Inside the main part of [[Bangladesh]], there were 111 Indian enclaves (17,160.63 acres), while inside the main part of [[India]], there were 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (7,110.02 acres). In 1974 Bangladesh approved a proposed treaty, Land Boundary Agreement, to exchange all enclaves within each other's territories, but India did not ratify it. Another agreement was agreed upon in 2011 to exchange enclaves and adverse possessions.  With respect to adverse possessions, India received 2,777.038 acres of land and transferred 2,267.682 acres to Bangladesh.

| Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845, but its claims were ignored by the Russian Empire. The 1855 Treaty of Shimoda acknowledged that both Russia and Japan had joint rights of occupation to Sakhalin, without setting a definite territorial demarcation. As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.
In 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.  In 1905 under the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] Japan gained Sakhalin to the 60th parallel, but lost it again in 1945.

| Disputed between the United States and Canada (then a British Dominion with its foreign affairs controlled from London). The dispute had been going on between the Russian and British Empires since 1821, and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 with a delegation that included 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, and 1 British delegate that became the swing vote. By a 4 to 2 vote, the final resolution favored the American position. Canada did not get an outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in pursuit of a friendly relationship between Britain and the United States.

During 1749â64, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred "grants", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, King George III attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion. Negotiations between New York and Vermont in 1790 removed impediments to Vermont's [[admission to the Union]] in 1791.

| Ill-defined terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the Revolutionary War left the boundary of the state of [[New Hampshire]] and Canada in doubt.  The lack of a precise definition of the "northwesternmost head of the Connecticut River" as defined by the Treaty of Paris left the land that is now the town of [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]] within the conflicting jurisdiction of both the United States and Great Britain.  In 1832 residents of the area established the short-lived [[Republic of Indian Stream]] in the area; the minuscule population of the putative nation never exceeded about 300.  The boundary was finally settled definitively by the [[WebsterâAshburton Treaty]] of 1842.

| In 1928 [[Norway]] asserted its claim of sovereignty over the [[Sverdrup Islands]]. The islands are named after Norwegian explorer [[Otto Sverdrup]], who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel ''[[Fram]]'', although some were previously inhabited by [[Inuit]] people. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government did not pursue the claim until 1928. At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the [[United Kingdom]] over the status of the Arctic island [[Jan Mayen]] and the Antarctic [[Bouvet Island]]. On November 11, 1930, Norway ceded the Sverdrup Islands to Canada, in exchange for British recognition of Norway's sovereignty over [[Jan Mayen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|title=The Arctic Grail: the Quest for the North West Passage and the North Pole, 1818â1909|year=1988|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-82491-5|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Sweden and Finland argued over the control of the Ãland Islands (located between Sweden and Finland). The Ãland movement (ÃlandsrÃ¶relsen) wanted Ãland to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and Ãland belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the Ãland Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When Finland became independent (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the Ãland Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the Ãland Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the League of Nations referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the Ãland Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didnât accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831. The British were the first to claim the island as part of Malta, and they were followed by the Two Sicilies and France, while Spain expressed their ambitions to control the island. The island disappeared by December 1831 and the dispute stopped. A Sicilian flag was lowered over the now submerged island in 2000 to show Italian claims to the area. It is no longer disputed by Britain, France, Spain or Malta.

The new Turkish Government of [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]], based in Ankara, which was not party to the treaty, overthrew the Ottoman government, which signed but did not ratify the treaty. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] ended in Greek defeat in Anatolia, and the fall of Lloyd George and his Middle Eastern policies, the western powers agreed to the Treaty of Lausanne with the new Turkish Republic, in 1923. This treaty made Tenedos and Imbros part of Turkey, and it guaranteed a special autonomous administrative status there to accommodate the Greeks.

Lithuania [[Temporary capital of Lithuania|moved its capital]] to [[Kaunas]] while never giving up its claim to Vilnius. The Lithuanians found support in the Soviet Union for their cause signing the [[Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] in 1939. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]], the region came under Soviet control and became part of the [[Lithuanian SSR]] after World War II which was followed by a large number of ethnic Poles being deported [[Polish population transfers (1944-1946)|two]] [[Repatriation of Poles (1955-1959)|times]].

'''Loerrach International''' e.V. (registered society) is an association of citizens, educational, sport and cultural institutions, service clubs, municipal administration and local council in [[LÃ¶rrach]] in southwestern Germany. It has the goal of fostering relations with the townâs partner towns. Its structure has long been a model for similar town partnership organisations in other European cities.

==Foundation and Function==
At the suggestion of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Konrad Adenauer]] the then mayor of Loerrach [[Egon Hugenschmidt]] founded the first partnership with [[Sens]] in [[France]] in 1966. Under mayor [[Rainer Offergeld]] the partnership with [[Senigallia]] in [[Italy]] followed and in 1986 and under mayor [[Gudrun Heute-Bluhm]] in 2003 with [[Chester]] in [[England]]. Further partnerships have been established with [[Meerane]] in [[Saxony]], [[Vyshhorod]] in the [[Ukraine]] und [[Lubliniec]] in [[Silesia]]. A special feature is the friendship with [[Edirne]] in [[Turkey]], which arose from a citizensâ initiative.

Loerrach International was founded by Gudrun Heute-Bluhm as President and [[Manfred G. Raupp]] as Chairman on the 22nd of September 2004. The various fractions in the city council were each asked to nominate a representative and a deputy to the extended board of the society.

Working groups were set up for Sens, Senigallia, Chester, Meerane, and Eastern Europe, and the youth organisation SAK LÃ¶rrach, the town band, its schools (Hans-Thoma-Gymnasium LÃ¶rrach, Phaenovum SchÃ¼lerforschungszentrum LÃ¶rrach-DreilÃ¤ndereck) and the technical college DHBW Loerrach, sport and culture organisations and service clubs were invited to collaborate.
On his election to mayor in 2014 [[JÃ¶rg Lutz]] became ex officio president of the society. In September 2016 Susanne Daniel succeeded Manfred Raupp as chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loerrach.de/739?view=publish&amp;item=article&amp;id=4842 Susanne Daniel neue Vorsitzende von LÃ¶rrach International]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/loerrach/partnerstaedte-kommen-zum-fruehlingsfest--135797068.html Vertreter der PartnerstÃ¤dte kommen zum FrÃ¼hlingsfest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verlagshaus-jaumann.de/inhalt.loerrach-ende-der-aera-manfred-raupp.8ba1c6ba-c7fd-4419-bf7a-23dfa8161880.html Ende der Aera Manfred Raupp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the societyâs foundation around 50 events involving the partner towns take place every year., the majority involving schools and youth groups from the partner towns.

== Structure ==
The structure of the society brings together interested citizens, educational institutions, the local council and city administration. The president is ex officio the current mayor and the secretarial duties of the management committee is the responsibility of the representatives of the various town partnerships, but all other activities are carried out on a voluntary basis by those elected by the approximately 140 members.

Most pre-sliced lunch meats are higher in [[fat]], [[nitrates]], and [[sodium]] than those that are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface requires stronger preservatives.&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt; As a result, processed meats significantly contribute to incidence of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and [[Diabetes insipidus|diabetes]], even more so than [[red meat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unprocessed red and processed meats and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes--an updated review of the evidence|journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports|date = 2012-12-01|issn = 1534-6242|pmc = 3483430|pmid = 23001745|pages = 515â524|volume = 14|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s11883-012-0282-8|first = Renata|last = Micha|first2 = Georgios|last2 = Michas|first3 = Dariush|last3 = Mozaffarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prospective study following 448,568 people across Europe showed a positive association between processed [[meat consumption]] and mortality, due to cardiovascular diseases and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meat consumption and mortality--results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition|journal = BMC Medicine|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1741-7015|pmc = 3599112|pmid = 23497300|pages = 63|volume = 11|doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-11-63|first = Sabine|last = Rohrmann|first2 = Kim|last2 = Overvad|first3 = H.

== Safety ==
The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] advises that those over 50 reheat lunch meats to "steaming hot" {{convert|165|Â°F|Â°C|0|abbr=on}} and use them within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/2011-05-04-listeria-cdc-lunch-meat_n.htm |title=CDC: Over 50?

== Regional differences ==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}

=== Commonwealth countries ===
In [[The Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries, luncheon meat specifically refers to products that can include [[mechanically reclaimed meat]] and [[offal]]. In these countries, the terms "cold meats", "cooked meats", "deli meats", or "sliced meats" are used, instead.

=== Latin America ===

In [[Guatemala]], a lunch meat is a traditional dish eaten in November. It is eaten the first and second day of the month to celebrate ''El dÃ­a de Todos los Santos'' ([[All Saints' Day]]) and ''El dÃ­a de Todos los Difuntos'' ([[All Souls' Day]]). The two types are red and white.

=== Central Europe ===
The product got more popular after investigation what it contains. E.g. LUNCHEON MEAT TULIP (made in Denmark) is not made of 70% of meat as expected (base on country standard), but contains 18% of pork meat, 39% of chicken mechanically separated meat, 18% of pork mechanically separated meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/411702-velky-test-lunchmeatu-tohle-cteni-chce-silny-zaludek.html|title=VelkÃ½ test lunchmeatÅ¯.

'''MARC''' ([[Machine-readable data|'''MA'''chine-'''R'''eadable]] [[Cataloguing|'''C'''ataloging]]) '''[[Technical standard|standards]]''' are a set of [[Digital data|digital]] [[File format|formats]] for the description of items catalogued by libraries, such as books.  Working with the [[Library of Congress]], American computer scientist [[Henriette Avram]] developed MARC in the 1960s to create records that could be read by computers and shared among libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Henriette Avram, 'Mother of MARC,' Dies|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0605/avram.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, MARC formats had become the US national standard for dissemination of [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]]. Two years later, they became the [[international standard]].
There are several versions of MARC in use around the world, the most predominant being [[MARC 21]], created in 1999 as a result of the harmonization of U.S. and Canadian MARC formats, and [[UNIMARC]], widely used in Europe. The MARC 21 family of standards now includes formats for [[authority record]]s, holdings records, [[Library classification|classification schedules]], and community information, in addition to the format for [[bibliographic record]]s.

==Record structure and field designations==

The MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record:  the field designations within each record, the structure of the record, and the actual content of the record itself.

===Field designations===

Each '''field''' in a MARC record provides particular information about the item the record is describing, such as the author, title, publisher, date, language, media type, etc.  Since it was first developed at a time when computing power was low, and space precious, MARC uses a simple three-digit numeric code (from 001-999) to identify each field in the record.  MARC defines field 100 as the primary author of a work, field 245 as the title and field 260 as the publisher, for example.

Fields above 008 are further divided into '''subfields''' using a single letter or number designation.  The 260, for example, is further divided into subfield "a" for the place of publication, "b" for the name of the publisher, and "c" for the date of publication.

===Record structure===

MARC records are typically stored and transmitted as binary files, usually with several MARC records concatenated together into a single file.  MARC uses the [[ISO 2709]] standard to define the structure of each record.  This includes a marker to indicate where each record begins and ends, as well as a set of characters at the beginning of each record that provide a directory for locating the fields and subfields within the record.

In 2002, the Library of Congress developed the MARCXML schema as an alternative record structure, allowing MARC records to be represented in [[XML]]; the fields remain the same, but those fields are expressed in the record in XML [[Markup language|markup]]. Libraries typically expose their records as MARCXML via a [[web service]], often following the [[Search/Retrieve via URL|SRU]] or [[OAI-PMH]] standards.

===Content===

MARC encodes information about a bibliographic item, not about the content of that item; this means it is a [[metadata]] transmission standard, not a content standard. The actual content that a cataloger places in each MARC field is usually governed and defined by standards outside of MARC, except for a handful of fixed fields defined by the MARC standards themselves. [[Resource Description and Access]], for example, defines how the physical characteristics of books and other items should be expressed. The [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH) are a list of authorized subject terms used to describe the main subject content of the work. Other cataloging rules and classification schedules can also be used.

==MARC formats==
{| class="wikitable"
|+MARC formats
!Name
!Description
|-
|[[Authority record]]s
|provide information about individual names, subjects, and [[uniform title]]s. An authority record establishes an authorized form of each heading, with references as appropriate from other forms of the heading.
|-
|Bibliographic records
|describe the intellectual and physical characteristics of bibliographic resources (books, sound recordings, video recordings, and so forth).
|-
|Classification records
|MARC records containing classification data. For example, the Library of Congress Classification has been encoded using the MARC 21 Classification format.
|-
|Community Information records
|MARC records describing a service-providing agency, such as a local [[homeless shelter]] or tax assistance provider.
|-
|Holdings records
|provide copy-specific information on a library resource (call number, shelf location, volumes held, and so forth).

===MARC 21===

MARC 21 was designed to redefine the original MARC record format for the 21st century and to make it more accessible to the international community. MARC 21 has formats for the following five types of data: Bibliographic Format, Authority Format, Holdings Format, Community Format, and Classification Data Format.&lt;ref name="Joudrey and Taylor, p. 262" /&gt; Currently MARC 21 has been implemented successfully by The [[British Library]], the European Institutions and the major library institutions in the United States, and [[Canada]].

MARC 21 is a result of the combination of the United States and Canadian MARC formats (USMARC and CAN/MARC). MARC21 is based on the [[National Information Standards Organization| NISO]]/[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard [[Z39.2]], which allows users of different software products to communicate with each other and to exchange data.&lt;ref name="Joudrey and Taylor, p. 262" &gt;[[#Joudrey and Taylor, Organization of Information|Joudrey and Taylor, Organization of Information]], p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

MARC 21 allows the use of two [[Character encoding|character sets]], either [[MARC-8]] or [[Unicode]] encoded as [[UTF-8]]. MARC-8 is based on [[ISO 2022]] and allows the use of Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and East Asian scripts. MARC 21 in UTF-8 format allows all the languages supported by Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/speccharmarc8.html|title=Character Sets:  MARC-8 Encoding Environment: MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MARCXML===
MARCXML  is an [[XML]] [[XML schema|schema]] based on the common [[MARC21]] standards.&lt;ref name = "marcxml"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/ |title=MARC 21 XML Schema |publisher= Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MARCXML was developed by the [[Library of Congress]] and adopted by it and others as a means of facilitating the sharing of, and networked access to, bibliographic information.&lt;ref name = "marcxml"/&gt; Being easy to parse by various systems allows it to be used as an aggregation format, as it is in software packages such as [[MetaLib]], though that package merges it into a wider [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] specification.

The MARCXML primary design goals included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/marcxml-design.html |title=MARC XML Design Considerations |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Simplicity of the schema	
* Flexibility and extensibility
* Lossless and reversible conversion from MARC
* Data presentation through XML stylesheets
* MARC records updates and data conversions through XML transformations
* Existence of validation tools

==Future==

The future of the MARC formats is a matter of some debate among libraries. On the one hand, the storage formats are quite complex and are based on outdated technology. On the other, there is no alternative bibliographic format with an equivalent degree of granularity. The billions of MARC records in tens of thousands of individual libraries (including over 50,000,000 records belonging to the [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC consortium]] alone) create inertia. The Library of Congress has launched the [[Bibliographic Framework Initiative]] (BIBFRAME),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bibframe.org/ |title=Bibliographic Framework Initiative |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims at providing a replacement for MARC that provides greater granularity and easier re-use of the data expressed in multiple catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url = https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/media/updateforum-nov22-2013.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2013, OCLC Research exposed data detailing how various MARC elements have been used by libraries in the 400 million MARC records (as of early 2018) contained in WorldCat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://experimental.worldcat.org/marcusage/|title = MARC Usage in WorldCat|date = 2013|accessdate = April 8, 2015|website = |publisher = OCLC Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MARC formats are managed by the MARC Steering Group, which is advised by the MARC Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/marc/mac/MAC_members.html|title=MARC Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for changes to MARC are submitted to the MARC Advisory Committee and discussed in public at the American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter and ALA Annual meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1604">'''Microprudential regulation''' or  '''microprudential supervision''' is firm-level oversight or [[financial regulation]] by regulators of financial institutions, "ensuring the balance sheets of individual institutions are robust to shocks".&lt;ref&gt;Dr Alan Bollard, Bernard Hodgetts, and Mike Hannah. Where we are going with macro and micro-prudential policies in New Zealand? A speech delivered to the Basel III Conference in Sydney On 25 March 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/speeches/2011/4327011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811165837/http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/speeches/2011/4327011.html |archivedate=2013-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The motivation for micro-prudential regulation is rooted in [[consumer protection]]: ensuring [[solvency]] of financial institutions strengthens consumer confidence in the individual firms and the financial system as a whole. In addition, if a large number of financial firms fail at the same time, this can disrupt the overall financial system. Therefore, micro-prudential regulation also reduces [[systemic risk]].

==Standards==
Micro-prudential regulation involves enforcing standards, e.g. the [[Basel III]] global regulatory standards for bank capital adequacy, leverage ratios and liquidity.

Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the [[Principality of Moldavia]] from the 14th century until 1812, when it was [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|ceded]] to the [[Russian Empire]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (to which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state of the Ottoman Empire|vassal state]]) and became known as [[Bessarabia]]. In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]], but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Bessarabia briefly became autonomous and then the independent [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] until it was integrated into [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], which in 1924 allowed the establishment, within the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], of a [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian autonomous republic]] (MASSR) on partial Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of the [[Dniester]]. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[MolotovâRibbentrop Pact]], Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the creation of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR.

On 27 August 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was under way, the Moldavian SSR [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] and took the name Moldova. The [[Constitution of Moldova]] was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester river has been under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of the breakaway government of [[Transnistria]] since 1990.

Due to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the [[service sector]] has grown to dominate [[Economy of Moldova|Moldova's economy]] and is over 60% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Its economy is the poorest in Europe in per capita terms&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/poorest-list/the-10-most-poverty-ridden-countries-in-europe/ |title=The 10 Most Poverty Ridden Countries in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the lowest [[Human Development Index]] in the continent. Moldova is also the least visited country in Europe by tourists with only 11,000 annually recorded visitors from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelersdigest.com/7402-ten-least-visited-countries-in-europe/2/|title=The Ten Least Visited Countries in Europe - Page 2 of 2 - Traveler's Digest|date=22 August 2014|website=Travelersdigest.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova is a [[parliamentary republic]] with a [[President of Moldova|president]] as [[head of state]] and a [[List of Prime Ministers of Moldova|prime minister]] as [[head of government]]. It is a member state of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization (WTO)]], the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)]], the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)]] and the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)]] and aspires to join the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moldpres.md/default.asp?Lang=en&amp;ID=68715| title=Moldova will prove that it can and has chances to become EU member| publisher=Moldpress News Agency| date=19 June 2007| accessdate=13 June 2014| dead-url=y| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430044847/http://www.moldpres.md/default.asp?Lang=en&amp;ID=68715| archive-date=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://politicom.moldova.org/news/moldovaeu-action-plan-approved-by-european-commission-40-eng.html| title=Moldova-EU Action Plan Approved by European Commission| publisher=politicom.moldova.org| date=14 December 2004| accessdate=2 July 2007| dead-url=y| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104906/http://politicom.moldova.org/news/moldovaeu-action-plan-approved-by-european-commission-40-eng.html| archive-date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Name of Moldova}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:CuTryOutline.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|left|Area of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]].]]
The prehistory of Moldova covers the period from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] which begins with the presence of [[Cro-Magnon|Homo sapiens]] in the area of [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|Southeastern Europe]] some 44,000 years ago and extends into the appearance of the first written records in [[Classical Antiquity]] in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].

In 2010 N.K. Anisjutkin discovered [[Oldowan]] flint tools at Bayraki that are 800,000â1.2 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://paleogeo.org/article3.html|title= GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EARLIEST PALEOLITHIC SITES (OLDOWAN) IN THE NORTH CAUCASUS AND THE EAST EUROPE| publisher= paleogeo.org|date= 2011| dead-url= y| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130520090413/http://paleogeo.org/article3.html| archive-date= 20 May 2013 | quote = Early Paleolithic cultural layers with tools of oldowan type was discovered in East Caucasus (Dagestan, Russia) by Kh.

The people of this civilization, which lasted roughly from 5500 to 2750 BC, practised agriculture, raised livestock, hunted, and made intricately-designed pottery.&lt;ref&gt;

===Moldovan lands in antiquity and the early Middle Ages===
[[File:Bolohoveni land from A.V. Boldur description.PNG|thumb|200px|right|The "land of Bolokhoveni", according to Alexandru V. Boldur.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=111}}]]
In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], Moldova's territory was inhabited by [[Dacians|Dacian]] tribes. Between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, the south was intermittently under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and then [[Byzantine Empire]]s. Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, the territory of modern Moldova was invaded many times in late antiquity and the [[early Middle Ages]], including by [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongols]] and [[Mongol and Tatar states in Europe|Tatars]].

The [[Bolokhoveni|Bolohoveni]], a [[Vlachs|Vlach population]], is mentioned by the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of [[Halych]], [[Volhynia]] and [[Kiev]]. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper.&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Boldur, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura V. Frunza, p 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by [[Daniel of Galicia]]'s troops.

In the early 13th century, the ''[[Brodnici|Brodniks]]'', a possible [[Slavs|Slavic]]&amp;ndash;[[Vlachs|Vlach]] [[vassal]] state of [[Halych-Volhynia|Halych]], were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Suzdal]]).

On the border between Halych and the Brodniks, in the 11th century, a [[Viking]] by the name of Rodfos was killed in the area by Vlachs who supposedly betrayed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060616225750/http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |archivedate=2006-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1164, the future [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds around the same region.

===Founding of the Principality of Moldavia===
{{main|Founding of Moldavia}}
[[File:MoldavianPrincipalityPhysical.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Principality of [[Moldavia]] and the modern boundaries of Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania.]]
The [[Founding of Moldavia|founding of the Principality of Moldavia]] began with the arrival of a [[Vlach]] [[voivode]] (military leader), [[DragoÈ]], soon followed by his people from [[MaramureÈ]] to the region of the [[Moldova River]]. DragoÈ established a [[polity]] there as a vassal to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1350s. The independence of the [[Principality]] of [[Moldavia]] was gained when [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], another Vlach voivode from MaramureÈ who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of [[Moldavia]] was bounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, the [[Dniester]] River in the east, and the Danube River and [[Black Sea]] to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the [[Western Moldavia|eastern eight counties]] of Romania, and parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Budjak]] region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania's north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as ''Moldova''.

===Between Poland and Hungary===
[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1386â1434 showing the [[Principality of Moldavia]] as a Polish fief.]]

The history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish chronicler [[Jan DÅugosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[WÅadysÅaw I the Elbow-high|WÅadysÅaw I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan DÅugosz'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.

Ties between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], a Vlach [[voivode]] from [[MaramureÈ]] who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[LaÈcu of Moldavia|LaÈcu]], the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the Poles. LaÈcu also accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. 

[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo|WÅadysÅaw II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea AlbÄ]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[GhindÄoani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

Although [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history.

===The Ottomans===
{{triple image|right|Stefan cel Mare.jpg|104|Soroca Fort..JPG|225|The Soroca fortress.jpg|200| Built during the reign of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ''(pictured above)'', several authors believed the [[Soroca Fort]] was constructed on the site of a former [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fortress named ''Olhionia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.istoria.md/articol/103/Cetatea_Soroca_a_Moldovei| title=Cetatea Soroca a Moldovei (1499 â prezent)|publisher=Istoria.md| last=Bulat| first=Nicolae| language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] took place at Cetatea AlbÄ in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[AlexÄndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].

During this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean [[Tatars]] and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a [[tribute|tributary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/3.htm|title=Moldova: Early History|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=June 1995|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] removed [[Ieremia MovilÄ]] from Moldavia's throne by winning the battle of [[BacÄu]], briefly reuniting under his rule [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and [[Transylvania]]. A Polish army led by [[Jan Zamoyski]] drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia MovilÄ to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the [[PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth]]. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.

While [[Transnistria]] was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers. The earliest surviving deeds referring to lands beyond the Dniester river date from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sava, p.4-6&lt;/ref&gt; Moldavian chronicle [[Grigore Ureche]] which mentions that in 1584, some Moldavian villages from beyond the Dniester in the [[Kingdom of Poland]] were attacked and plundered by [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigore Ureche]] ''[[s:ro:LetopiseÅ£ul Å£ÄrÃ¢i Moldovei, de cÃ¢nd s-au descÄlecat Å£ara|LetopiseÅ£ul Å£ÄrÃ¢i Moldovei, de cÃ¢nd s-au descÄlecat Å£ara]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Moldovans were members of Cossacks units as well, with two of them, [[Ioan PotcoavÄ]] and [[Danylo Apostol|DÄnilÄ Apostol]] becoming [[hetman]]s of [[Ukraine]]. [[Ruxandra Lupu]], the daughter of Moldavian voivode [[Vasile Lupu]] who married [[Tymish Khmelnytsky]], lived in [[RaÅcov]] according to Ukrainian tradition.

While most of today's Moldova came into the Ottoman orbit in the 16th century, a substantial part of [[Transnistria]] remained a part of the [[PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.

===Modern history===

====Russian Empire====
In accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest of 1812]], and despite numerous protests by Moldavian nobles on behalf of the sovereignty of their principality, the [[Ottoman Empire]] (of which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state|vassal]]) ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] the [[Bessarabia|eastern half of the territory]] of the Principality of Moldavia along with [[Khotyn]] and old Bessarabia (modern [[Budjak]]), which Russia had already conquered and annexed. The new Russian province was called [[Bessarabia Governorate|Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia]], and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of [[Forced assimilation|state-imposed assimilation]], [[Russification]]. As part of this process, the [[Tsarist]] administration in Bessarabia gradually removed the [[Romanian language]] from official and religious use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_10.shtml#bc_10| title=Bessarabia, Chapter X: The Survival of Roumanian| first=Charles Upson| last=Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Naturally, this system resulted not in acquisition of Russian by the Moldavians, but in their almost complete illiteracy in any language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] returned the southern part of Bessarabia (later organised as the [[Cahul County|Cahul]], Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to Moldavia, which remained an autonomous principality and, in 1859, [[Moldavia and Wallachia|united]] with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]]. In 1878, as a result of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], Romania was forced to cede the three counties back to the Russian Empire.

Over the 19th century, the Russian authorities encouraged the [[colonization]] of Bessarabia by [[Romanians]], [[Russians in Moldova|Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Bessarabian Germans|Germans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], and [[Gagauzes]], primarily in the northern and southern areas vacated by Turks and [[Nogais|Nogai]] [[Tatars|Tatar]], the latter having been expelled in the 1770s and 1780s, during [[Russo-Turkish Wars]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/%7Egerman/PAA/Bessarabians.htm |title=The Germans from Bessarabia |publisher=Ualberta.ca |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926121442/http://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Bessarabians.htm |archivedate=26 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_8.shtml#bc_8|title=Bessarabia, Chapter VIII: Russia Organizes the Province|author=Charles Upson Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Today, the Bulgarians form one of the most solid elements in Southern Bessarabia, numbering (with the Gagauzes, i.e., Turkish-speaking Christians also from the Dobrudja) nearly 150,000.

====Russian Revolution and Greater Romania====
[[File:Greater Romania.svg|thumb|200px|A map of [[Greater Romania]] between 1920 and 1940.]]
[[World War I]] brought in a rise in political and cultural (ethnic) awareness among the inhabitants of the region, as 300,000 Bessarabians were drafted into the [[Red Army|Russian Army]] formed in 1917; within bigger units several "Moldavian Soldiers' Committees" were formed. Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]], a Bessarabian parliament, [[Sfatul ÈÄrii]] (a National Council), was [[Sfatul ÈÄrii election, 1917|elected in OctoberâNovember 1917]] and opened on {{OldStyleDate|December 3|1917|21 November}}. The Sfatul ÈÄrii proclaimed the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] ({{OldStyleDate|December 15|1917|2 December}}) within a federal Russian state, and formed a [[Pantelimon Erhan Cabinet|government]] ({{OldStyleDate|21 December|1917|8 December}}).

Bessarabia proclaimed independence from Russia on {{OldStyleDate|February 6|1918|24 January}} and requested the assistance of the French army present in Romania (general [[Henri Mathias Berthelot|Henri Berthelot]]) and of the [[Romanian army]], which had occupied the region in early January at the request of the National Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} Anthony Babel: ''La Bessarabie (Bessarabia)'', FÃ©lix Alcan, GenÃ¨ve, Switzerland, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDate|April 9|1918|27 March}}, the Sfatul ÈÄrii decided with 86 votes for, 3 against and 36 abstaining, to [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|unite with the Kingdom of Romania]].

In May 1919, the [[Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed as a government in exile. After the failure of the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] in 1924, the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian ASSR) was formed by Soviet Russia within the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]], the present-day [[Transnistria]].

====World War II and Soviet era====

In August 1939, the [[MolotovâRibbentrop Pact]] and its secret additional protocol were signed, by which [[Nazi Germany]] recognized Bessarabia as being within the [[Soviet sphere of influence]], which led the latter to actively revive its claim to the region.&lt;ref name="Olson 1994 483"&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=James |title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires |year=1994 |page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|ultimatum to Romania]] requesting the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, with which Romania complied the following day.

As part of the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]], Romania regained the territories of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, and seized [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]].

In the postwar period, the Soviet government organized the immigration of working age Russian speakers (mostly Russians, [[Belarusians]], and Ukrainians), into the new Soviet republic, especially into urbanized areas, partly to compensate for the demographic loss caused by the war and the emigration of 1940 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Pal Kolsto, ''National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-7425-1888-4}}, pg. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the Moldavian SSR received substantial allocations from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial and scientific facilities and housing.

The Soviet government conducted a campaign to promote a Moldovan ethnic identity distinct from that of the Romanians, based on a theory developed during the existence of the [[Moldavian ASSR]]. Official Soviet policy asserted that the language spoken by [[Moldovans]] was distinct from the [[Romanian language]] (see [[Moldovenism]]). To distinguish the two, during the Soviet period, Moldovan was written in the [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], in contrast with Romanian, which since 1860 had been written in the [[Latin alphabet]].

The [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1990|first democratic elections]] for the local [[Moldovan Parliament|parliament]] were held in February and March 1990. [[Mircea Snegur]] was elected as [[Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament|Speaker of the Parliament]], and [[Mircea Druc]] as Prime Minister. On 23 June 1990, the Parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the "Soviet Socialist Republic Moldova", which, among other things, stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; After the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'Ã©tat attempt]], [[Declaration of Independence of Moldova|Moldova declared its independence]] on 27 August 1991.

On 21 December of the same year, Moldova, along with most of the other Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). Moldova received official recognition on 25 December. On 26 December 1991 the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a [[neutral state]], Moldova did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on 2 March 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. In 1994, Moldova became a member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program, and a member of the Council of Europe on 29 June 1995.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt;

In the region east of the [[Dniester]] river, [[Transnistria]], which includes a large proportion of predominantly [[russophone]] [[East Slavs]] of Ukrainian (28%) and Russian (26%) descent (altogether 54% as of 1989), an independent [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed on 16 August 1990, with its capital in [[Tiraspol]].&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova. In the winter of 1991â1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces, [[14th Army involvement in Transnistria|supported by elements of the 14th Army]], and the [[Law enforcement in Moldova|Moldovan police]]. Between 2 March and 26 July 1992, the conflict escalated into a [[War of Transnistria|military engagement]].

On 2 January 1992, Moldova introduced a [[market economy]], liberalizing prices, which resulted in rapid inflation. From 1992 to 2001, the country suffered a serious economic crisis, leaving most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, the government introduced a new national currency, the [[Moldovan leu]], to replace the [[Moldovan cupon|temporary cupon]]. The [[economy of Moldova]] began to change in 2001; and until 2008 the country saw a steady annual growth between 5% and 10%. The early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Russia (especially the Moscow region), Italy, Portugal, Spain, and other countries; [[remittance]]s from Moldovans abroad account for almost 38% of Moldova's [[GDP]], the second-highest percentage in the world, after [[Tajikistan]] (45%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ratha|first1=Dilip|authorlink=Dilip Ratha|url=http://peoplemove.worldbank.org/en/content/remittance-flows-to-developing-countries|title=Remittance flows to developing countries are estimated to exceed $300 billion in 2008|publisher=peoplemove.worldbank.org|date=18 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223020016/http://peoplemove.worldbank.org/en/content/remittance-flows-to-developing-countries|archivedate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2008/pbn-listing/information-campaign-in-moldova-seeks-to.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085911/https://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2008/pbn-listing/information-campaign-in-moldova-seeks-to.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 |title=Information Campaign to Increase the Efficiency of Remittance Flows |publisher=International Organization for Migration |date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary elections]], the [[Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova|Democratic Agrarian Party]] gained a majority of the seats, setting a turning point in Moldovan politics. With the nationalist Popular Front now in a parliamentary minority, new measures aiming to moderate the ethnic tensions in the country could be adopted. Plans for a [[Movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova|union with Romania]] were abandoned,&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; and the new [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)|Constitution]] gave autonomy to the breakaway Transnistria and Gagauzia. On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of Moldova adopted a "Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia", and in 1995 the latter was constituted.

After winning the [[Moldovan presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]], on 15 January 1997, [[Petru Lucinschi]], the former First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Moldova|Moldavian Communist Party]] in 1989â91, became the country's second president (1997â2001), succeeding Mircea Snegur (1991â1996). In 2000, the Constitution was amended, transforming Moldova into a [[parliamentary republic]], with the president being chosen through [[indirect election]] rather than direct popular vote.

[[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2001|Winning 49.9% of the vote]], the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] (reinstituted in 1993 after being outlawed in 1991), gained 71 of the 101 MPs, and on 4 April 2001, elected [[Vladimir Voronin]] as the country's third president (re-elected in 2005). The country became the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party returned to power.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; New governments were formed by [[Vasile Tarlev]] (19 April 2001 â 31 March 2008), and [[Zinaida GreceanÃ®i]] (31 March 2008 â 14 September 2009).

The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova managed to stay in power for eight years. The fragmentation of the liberal bloc (helped consolidate its power. The decline of the Communist Party started in 2009 after Marian Lupu joined the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Ion |last=Marandici |title=The Factors Leading to the Electoral Success, Consolidation and Decline of the Moldovan Communists' Party During the Transition Period |date=23 April 2010 |work=Midwestern Political Science Association Convention |publisher=Social Science Research Network |ssrn=1809029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, four Moldovan parties (Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal Party, [[Democratic Party of Moldova|Democratic Party]], and Our Moldova Alliance) agreed to create the [[Alliance For European Integration]] that pushed the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] into opposition.

[[File:Parliament Building in ChiÈinÄu.jpg|thumb|The [[Moldovan Parliament]]]]

Moldova is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative]] democratic [[republic]]. The 1994 Constitution of Moldova sets the framework for the government of the country. A parliamentary majority of at least two-thirds is required to amend the [[Constitution of Moldova]], which cannot be revised in time of war or national emergency. Amendments to the Constitution affecting the state's sovereignty, independence, or unity can only be made after a majority of voters support the proposal in a referendum. Furthermore, no revision can be made to limit the fundamental rights of people enumerated in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="const"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-democracy.md/en/legislation/constitution/ |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, 2000 |publisher=E-democracy.md |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's central legislative body is the [[unicameral]] [[Moldovan Parliament]] (''{{lang|ro|Parlament}}''), which has 101 seats, and whose members are elected by popular vote on [[proportional representation|party lists]] every four years.

The head of state is the President of Moldova, who between 2001 and 2015 was elected by the Moldovan Parliament, requiring the support of three-fifths of the deputies (at least 61 votes). The president of Moldova has been elected by the parliament since 2001, a change designed to decrease executive authority in favour of the legislature. Nevertheless, the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova|Constitutional Court]] ruled on 4 March 2016, that this constitutional change adopted in 2000 regarding the presidential election was unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurnal.md/ro/justitie/2016/3/4/decis-seful-statului-va-fi-ales-de-popor-modificarea-din-2000-a-constitutiei-privind-alegerea-presedintelui-de-parlament-neconstitutionala/ |title=DECIS: Åeful statului va fi ales de popor; Modificarea din 2000 a ConstituÅ£iei privind alegerea preÅedintelui de Parlament, NECONSTITUÅ¢IONALÄ |newspaper=[[Jurnalul NaÈional]] |date=4 March 2016 |language=Romanian |trans-title=DECIDED: The president will be elected by the people;  The 2000 amendment of the Constitution concerning the election of the President by Parliament unconstitutional }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus reverting the election method of the President to a [[two-round system]] [[direct election]].

The president appoints a [[List of Prime Ministers of Moldova|prime minister]] who functions as the [[head of government]], and who in turn assembles a [[Cabinet of Moldova|cabinet]], both subject to parliamentary approval.

The 1994 constitution also establishes an [[Judicial independence|independent]] [[Constitutional Court of Moldova|Constitutional Court]], composed of six judges (two appointed by the President, two by Parliament, and two by the Supreme Council of [[magistrate|Magistrature]]), serving six-year terms, during which they are irremovable and not subordinate to any power. The Court is invested with the power of [[judicial review]] over all acts of the parliament, over presidential decrees, and over international treaties, signed by the country.&lt;ref name="const"/&gt;

===Internal affairs===
On 19 December 2016, Moldovan MPs approved raising the retirement age to 63 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/19/europes-poorest-nation-passes-imf-backed-retirement-age-increase.html|title=Europeâs poorest nation passes IMF-backed retirement age increase|first=|last=CNBC|date=19 December 2016|website=Cnbc.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the current level of 57 for women and 62 for men, a reform that is part of a 3-year-old assistance program agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The retirement age will be lifted gradually by a few months every year until coming fully into effect in 2028.

Life expectancy in the ex-Soviet country - Europe's poorest - is 67.5 years for men and 75.5 years for women. In a country with a population of 3.5 million, of which 1 million are abroad, there are more than 700,000 pensioners.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign Relations of Moldova|MoldovaâEuropean Union relations}}
[[File:European Union Moldova Locator.svg|thumb|Accession to the [[European Union|EU]] is a central issue in Moldovan politics]]

After achieving independence from the Soviet Union, Moldova's foreign policy was designed with a view to establishing relations with other European countries, neutrality, and European Union integration. In 1995 the country was admitted to the [[Council of Europe]].

In addition to its participation in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] programme, Moldova is also a member state of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|la Francophonie]] and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].

In 2005, [[Moldova and the EU]] established an action plan that sought to improve collaboration between its two neighbouring countries, Romania and Ukraine. At the end of 2005 EUBAM, the [[European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine]], was established at the joint request of the presidents of Moldova and Ukraine. EUBAM assists the Moldovan and Ukrainian governments in approximating their border and customs procedures to EU standards, and offers support in both countries' fight against cross-border crime.

After the 1990â1992 [[War of Transnistria]], Moldova sought a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Transnistria region by working with Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, calling for international mediation, and co-operating with the OSCE and UN fact-finding and observer missions. The [[foreign minister of Moldova]], [[Andrei Stratan]], repeatedly stated that the Russian troops stationed in the breakaway region were there against the will of the Moldovan government and called on them to leave "completely and unconditionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/moldova-calls-on-russian-troops-to-leave-transdniestr-574221 |title=Moldova Calls on Russian Troops To Leave Transdniestr}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a [[2012 Moldova security zone incident|security zone incident]] resulted in the death of a civilian, raising tensions with [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Barry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/world/europe/shooting-raises-tensions-between-moldova-and-russia.html |title=Shooting at Checkpoint Raises Tensions in a Disputed Region Claimed by Moldova |work=The New York Times |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2013, at a summit in Vilnius, Moldova signed an association agreement with the European Union dedicated to the European Union's '[[Eastern Partnership]]' with ex-Soviet countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207232619/http://www.eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm |archivedate=7 December 2013 |title=EU-Moldova Association Agreement |work=European Union External Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ex-Romanian President [[Traian BÄsescu]] stated that [[Romania]] will make all efforts for Moldova to join the EU as soon as possible. Likewise, Traian BÄsescu declared that the [[unification of Moldova with Romania]] is the next national project for Romania, as more than 75% of the population speaks Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/politica/institutii/basescu--urmatorul-proiect-de-tara-al-romaniei--unirea-cu-basarabia-319094 |title=BÄsescu: UrmÄtorul proiect de ÈarÄ al RomÃ¢niei, unirea cu Basarabia |newspaper=RomÃ¢nia LiberÄ |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova has signed the Association Agreement with the European Union in Brussels on 27 June 2014. The signing comes after the accord has been initialed in Vilnius in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2014/270614_association_agreement_en.htm|title=European Union â EEAS (European External Action Service) â EU forges closer ties with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova|website=Eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-511_en.htm|title=European Commission â PRESS RELEASES â Press release â Remarks by President Barroso at the signing of the Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine|website=Europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be said that religious leaders play a role in shaping foreign policy.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Government has frequently used its connections with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to block and stymie the integration of former Soviet states like Moldova into the West.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''The New York Times'', September 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moldovan armed forces consist of the [[Moldovan Ground Forces|Ground Forces]] and [[Moldovan Air Force|Air Force]]. Moldova has accepted all relevant arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union. On 30 October 1992, Moldova ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment and provides for the destruction of weapons in excess of those limits. The country acceded to the provisions of the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in October 1994 in [[Washington, D.C.]] It does not have nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Moldova joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] on 16 March 1994.

Moldova is committed to a number of international and regional control of arms regulations such as the UN Firearms Protocol, Stability Pact Regional Implementation Plan, the UN Programme of Action (PoA) and the OSCE Documents on Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition.

Since declaring independence in 1991, Moldova has participated in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Sudan and Georgia.

Moldova signed a military agreement with Romania to strengthen regional security. The agreement is part of Moldova's strategy to reform its military and cooperate with its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moldova's military agreements to help strengthen regional security|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/2013/12/21/news/moldovas-military-agreements-to-help-strengthen-regional-security/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002008/http://www.turkishweekly.net/2013/12/21/news/moldovas-military-agreements-to-help-strengthen-regional-security/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 September 2015|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2014, the US donated to Moldovan Armed Forces 39 [[Humvees]] and 10 trailers, with a value of US$700,000, to the 22nd Peacekeeping Battalion of the Moldovan National Army to "increase the capability of Moldovan peacekeeping contingents."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moldova.usembassy.gov/111214.html|title=2014 â Embassy of the United States ChiÈinÄu, Moldova|website=Moldova.usembassy.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002008/http://moldova.usembassy.gov/111214.html|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], as of 2004 "Torture and other ill-treatment in police detention remained widespread; the state failed to carry out prompt and impartial investigations and police officers sometimes evaded penalties.

According to [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Human Rights Report]] of the [[United States Department of State]], released in April 2011, "In contrast to the previous year, there were no reports of killings by security forces.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Map of administrative divisions of Moldova|left}}
{{main|Administrative divisions of Moldova|List of cities in Moldova|List of localities in Moldova|Communes of Moldova}}

Moldova is divided into 32 districts (''raioane'', singular ''[[raion]]''), three municipalities and two autonomous regions ([[Gagauzia]] and [[Transnistria autonomous territorial unit|Transnistria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://descentralizare.gov.md/regionmap.php?l=ro&amp;idc=310|title=AutoritÄÈi publice locale|publisher=Government of Moldova|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final status of Transnistria is [[Disputed status of Transnistria|disputed]], as the central government does not control that territory. Other 10 cities, including the [[Comrat]] and [[Tiraspol]], the administrative seats of the two autonomous territories, also have [[municipiu|municipality status]].

Moldova has 66 cities (towns), including 13 with municipality status, and 916 communes. Another 700 villages are too small to have a separate administration, and are administratively part of either cities (41 of them) or communes (659). This makes for a total of 1,682 localities in Moldova, two of which are uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistica.md/public/files/Clasificatoare/CUATM_rom.zip Clasificatorul unitÄÅ£ilor administrativ-teritoriale (CUATM)] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toltre FTÈT-52.JPG|thumb|right|Toltrele Prutului near [[FeteÈti, EdineÈ|FeteÈti]], [[EdineÈ District]]]]

Moldova lies between latitudes [[45th parallel north|45Â°]] and [[49th parallel north|49Â° N]], and mostly between meridians [[26th meridian east|26Â°]] and [[30th meridian east|30Â° E]] (a small area lies east of 30Â°). The total land area is 33,851&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The largest part of the nation lies between two rivers, the [[Dniester]] and the [[Prut]]. The western border of Moldova is formed by the Prut river, which joins the [[Danube]] before flowing into the [[Black Sea]]. Moldova has access to the Danube for only about {{convert|480|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and [[GiurgiuleÈti]] is the only Moldovan port on the Danube. In the east, the Dniester is the main river, flowing through the country from north to south, receiving the waters of [[RÄut]], [[BÃ®c]], [[Ichel]], [[Botna]]. [[Ialpug]] flows into one of the Danube [[Liman (landform)|limans]], while [[CogÃ®lnic River|CogÃ®lnic]] into the Black Sea chain of limans.

The country is landlocked, though it is close to the Black Sea. While most of the country is hilly, elevations never exceed {{convert|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} â the highest point being the [[Dealul BÄlÄneÈti|BÄlÄneÈti Hill]]. Moldova's hills are part of the Moldavian Plateau, which geologically originate from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Its subdivisions in Moldova include the Dniester Hills (Northern Moldavian Hills and [[Dniester-RÄut Ridge|Dniester Ridge]]), the Moldavian Plain (Middle Prut Valley and [[BÄlÈi Steppe]]), and the Central Moldavian Plateau ([[Ciuluc-SoloneÈ Hills]], [[CorneÈti Hills]]â[[Codri]] Massive, "Codri" meaning "forests"â[[Lower Dniester Hills]], [[Lower Prut Valley]], and [[Tigheci Hills]]). In the south, the country has a small flatland, the [[Bugeac Plain]]. The territory of Moldova east of the river Dniester is split between parts of the [[Podolian Plateau]], and parts of the [[Eurasian Steppe]].

The country's main cities are the capital ChiÈinÄu, in the centre of the country, Tiraspol (in the eastern region of Transnistria), BÄlÈi (in the north) and Bender (in the south-east). [[Comrat]] is the administrative centre of Gagauzia.

===Climate===
Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the [[Black Sea]] leads to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring and summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Moldova.htm |title=Moldova's Climate |publisher=Weatheronline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about {{convert|20|Â°C|0|abbr=on}} and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging {{convert|-4|Â°C|0|abbr=on}}. Annual rainfall, which ranges from around {{convert|600|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the north to {{convert|400|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Moldova was {{convert|41.5|Â°C|1|abbr=on}} on 21 July 2007 in [[Camenca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=StÃ®nga Nistrului |url=http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Camenca |title=Camenca temperature |publisher=Weather-forecast.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-35.5|Â°C|1|abbr=on}} on 20 January 1963 in BrÄtuÈeni, EdineÈ county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Bratuseni-weather/Gagauzia/MD.aspx |title=Bratuseni temperature |publisher=Worldweatheronline.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the breakup from the USSR in 1991, energy shortages, political uncertainty, trade obstacles and weak administrative capacity contributed to the decline of economy. As a part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. 
The economy reversed from decline in late 90's. Since 1999 the GDP (PPP) had a steady growth as follows:&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=md&amp;v=65| title=Moldova â GDP (purchasing power parity) â Historical Data Graphs per Year| website=Indexmundi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although estimates point to possible modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate as reflected in strong sustained export performance.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14190.pdf |title=2014 Article IV consultation and first post-program monitoring discussions â Staff report; press release; and statement by the Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] |issue=IMF Country Report No. 14/190 |date=July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.

Moldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and [[European Union]] (EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.

Staff's spillover analysis suggests that further strengthening of fiscal and external buffers would be critical for mitigating the impact of external shocks, particularly in light of the Moldova's strong links and synchronized business cycle with trading partners.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt;

Moldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program that expired on 30 April 2013. The economy has strongly recovered from the drought-related contraction in 2012 but will slow down in 2014. Key risks to the near-term outlook relate to financial stability, fiscal policy slippages in the run up to the 2014 parliamentary elections, a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners, and intensification of geopolitical tensions.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt;

Corporate governance in the banking sector is a major concern. In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM's target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020âespecially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areasâwould help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; Moldova's remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova's economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010â13. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA).
[[File:Central market of Chisinau.JPG|thumb|Central market in ChiÈinÄu]]

A political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Despite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the
population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova's poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDSâMoldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|regional financial crisis in 1998]], Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy's further growth and development in the medium term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The government's goal of [[MoldovaâEuropean Union relations|EU integration]] has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences connecting Moldovan products to the world's largest market. Moldova has signed the [[MoldovaâEuropean Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union during summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.gov.md/sites/default/files/document/attachments/7048451_en_acord_asociere.pdf |title=Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part |publisher=Government of the Republic of Moldova |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova has also achieved a Free Visa Regime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/moldova/travel_eu/index_en.htm|title=European Union|website=Eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the EU which represents the biggest achievement of Moldovan diplomacy since independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/141491.pdf |title=Visa liberalisation for Moldova |publisher=Council of the European Union |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, growth has been hampered by high prices for Russian natural gas, a Russian import ban on Moldovan wine, increased foreign scrutiny of Moldovan agricultural products, and by Moldova's large external debt. Over the longer term, Moldova's economy remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, corruption, higher fuel prices, Russian pressure, and the separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.&lt;ref name="indexmundi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/moldova/economy_profile.html|title=Moldova Economy Profile 2014|website=Indexmundi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy in Moldova}}

With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a growing US$5 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the separatist Transnistria region. In August 2013, work began on a new pipeline between Moldova and Romania that may eventually break Russia's monopoly on Moldova's gas supplies.&lt;ref name="indexmundi.com"/&gt; Moldova is a partner country of the EU [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], [[Technological convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, supporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inogate.org|title=INOGATE website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in Moldova}}
Moldova's [[Chernozem|rich soil]] and [[temperate]] [[continental climate]] (with warm summers and mild winters) have made the country one of the most productive agricultural regions since ancient times, and a major supplier of agricultural products in southeastern Europe. In agriculture, the economic reform started with the land cadastre reform.&lt;ref name="cadastre law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lex.justice.md/md/295776/|title=Legea cu privire la secÅ£iile pentru reforma agrarÄ Ã®n cadrul organelor de autoadministrare localÄ ale Republicii Moldova Nr.129 din 02.03.92, Monitorul Oficial nr.3/80, 1992|trans-title=Law on Land Reform for the local self-administration of the Republic of Moldova Nr.129 from 02/03/92|issue=3|language=ro|work=Monitorul oficial|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main means of transportation in Moldova are railways {{convert|1138|km|mi|abbr=on}} and a highway system ({{convert|12730|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} overall, including {{convert|10937|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} of paved surfaces). The sole international air gateway of Moldova is the [[ChiÈinÄu International Airport]]. The [[GiurgiuleÈti]] terminal on the [[Danube]] is compatible with small seagoing vessels. Shipping on the lower [[Prut]] and [[Nistru]] rivers plays only a modest role in the country's transportation system.

{{main|Demographics of Moldova}}
As per [[Moldovan Census (2014)|2014 census]] preliminary data, 2,998,235 inhabitants live in Moldova (within the areas controlled by the central government), an 11.3% decrease from the figure recorded at the 2004 census.

The term "Moldavian" had initially described the inhabitants of the Moldavian Principality. In 1775, Austria annexed the northern part of the principality, thenceforth known as Bukovina; a second partition in 1812 resulted in Russia's annexation of the eastern part of Moldavia, thenceforth known as [[Bessarabia]]. {{citation needed span|The partitioned Moldavians did not undergo the same nation-building processes as did their ethnic counterparts in the Danubian Principalities, which identified as the new Romania. Thus, Romanian-language speakers in Bessarabia clung to a "Moldavian" identity.|date=April 2018}}

In the beginning of the 20th century, what is now Moldova was populated by [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Poles]], [[Bulgarians]], along with a nomadic [[Nogais|Nogai]] [[Tatar]] population. In 1927, [[Columbia University]] Professor [[Charles Upson Clark]], wrote that the lower Dniester was "an almost purely Romanian stream" since 1792.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_29.shtml Charles Upson Clark]&lt;/ref&gt; 
A Moldavian identity prevailed in Bessarabia into the interwar period, whereas a Romanian one had developed among ethnic Romanians in Bukovina even before the Great Union. Peasants in all three parts: Romanian, Austrian, and Russian, of historic Moldavia were more likely to identify as Moldavians than were educated city dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livezeanu|first1=Irina|title=CULTURAL POLITICS IN GREATER ROMANIA: REGIONALISM, NATION BUILDING &amp; ETHNIC STRUGGLE, 1918â1930|date=2000|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically Russian was taught in schools as the first foreign language, because of the relationship with the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. In the 21st century, the primary foreign language taught in the schools is English. In 2013 more than 60% of schoolchildren took it as their first foreign language. This was followed by [[French language|French]], taken by less than 50% of students.

Moldova's cultural tradition has been influenced primarily by the [[Origin of the Romanians|Romanian origins]] of its majority population, the roots of which go back to the 2nd century AD, the period of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colonisation in [[Dacia]].&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/18.htm|title=Moldova - Culture|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located geographically at the crossroads of [[Italic peoples|Latin]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other cultures, Moldova has enriched its own culture adopting and maintaining some of the traditions of its neighbours and of other influence sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Octavian Sofransky |format=PDF |url=http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/wg3-sofransky.pdf |title=Ethno-Political Conflict in Moldova |publisher=European Centre in Moldova |date= |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ethnic group, which had come to identify itself widely as "Moldovan" by the 14th century, is a speaker of Romanian and played a significant role in the shaping of [[Culture of Romania#Classical age|classical Romanian culture]], which still has a major role. The culture has been also influenced by the [[Byzantine]] culture, the neighbouring Magyar and Slavic population, and later by the Ottoman Turks. A strong Western European influence in Moldovan literature and arts was prevalent in the 19th century. During the periods 1812-1917 and 1944â89, the eastern Moldovans were influenced by Russian and Soviet administrative control as well and by ethnic Russian immigration.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;

The country's cultural heritage was marked by numerous churches and monasteries built by the Moldavian ruler [[Stephen the Great]] in the 15th century, by the works of the later renaissance Metropolitans [[Varlaam, Metropolitan of Moscow|Varlaam]] and [[Dosoftei]], and those of scholars such as [[Grigore Ureche]], [[Miron Costin]], [[Nicolae Milescu]], [[Dimitrie Cantemir]]{{efn|name=fn6|Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] was one of the most important figures of Moldavian culture of the 18th century. He wrote the first geographical, ethnographic and economic description of the country. {{La icon}} ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'', (Berlin, 1714), at Latin Wikisource.}} and [[Ion Neculce]]. In the 19th century, Moldavians from the territories of the medieval Principality of [[Moldavia]], divided into [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Western Moldavia]] (after 1859, Romania), made a significant contribution to the formation of the modern Romanian culture. Among these were many Bessarabians, such as [[Alecu Donici|Alexandru Donici]], [[Alexandru HÃ¢jdeu]], [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], [[Constantin Stamati]], [[Constantin Stamati-Ciurea]], [[Costache Negruzzi]], [[Alecu Russo]], [[Constantin Stere]].

[[Mihai Eminescu]], a late [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet, and [[Ion CreangÄ]], a writer, are the most influential [[Romanian language]] artists, considered national writers both in Romania and Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catherine Lovatt|url=http://www.ce-review.org/00/3/lovatt3.html|title=2000: Year of Eminescu|journal=Central Europe Review|volume=2|issue=3|date=24 January 2000|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has also important minority ethnic communities. Gagauz, 4.4% of the population, are [[Christian]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people. [[Greeks]], [[Armenians in Moldova|Armenians]], [[Poles]], Ukrainians, although not numerous, were present since as early as the 17th century, and had left cultural marks. The 19th century saw the arrival of many more Ukrainians from [[Podolia]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], as well as new communities, such as [[Lipovans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]] and [[Bessarabian Germans]].

Among Moldova's most prominent composers are [[Gavriil Musicescu]], [[Ètefan Neaga]] and [[Eugen Doga]].

In the field of pop music, Moldova has produced the band [[O-Zone]], who came to prominence in 2003, with their hit song "[[Dragostea Din Tei]]", which topped multiple notable single charts. Moldova has been participating in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] since 2005. Another popular band from Moldova is [[Zdob Èi Zdub]] that represented the country in the [[2005 Eurovision Song Contest]], finishing 6th.

In May 2007, [[Natalia Barbu]] represented Moldova in Helsinki at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] with her entry "[[Fight (song)|Fight]]". Natalia squeezed into the final by a very small margin. She took 10th place with 109 points.
Then [[Zdob Èi Zdub]] again represented Moldova in the [[2011 Eurovision Song Contest]] finishing 12th.

The band [[SunStroke Project]] with [[Olia Tira]] represented the country in the [[2010 Eurovision Song Contest]] with their hit song "[[Run Away (SunStroke Project and Olia Tira song)|Run Away]]". Their performance gained international notoriety as an [[internet meme]] due to the pelvic thrusting and dancing of Sergey Stepanov, the band saxophonist. He has been fittingly dubbed "[[Epic Sax Guy]]". SunStroke Project featured again in the 2017 Eurovision entry "Hey Mama" which got third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Final Scoreboard|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/kyiv-2017/grand-final/scoreboard|website=Eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a new musical project by the name of Carla's Dreams has risen in popularity around Moldova. Carla's Dreams reached the top charts in multiple countries in Europe with the release of their song "Sub Pielea Mea" in 2016. The song received a lot of airplay and reached number one place on the charts in Moldova as well as Russia. The group is still active and released their latest album in 2017. The theme of the musical group is "Anonymous" as they perform with painted faces, hoodies and sunglasses. The identity of the group members is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-15|title=Carla's Dreams|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carla%27s_Dreams&amp;oldid=830468926|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among most prominent classical musicians in Moldova are [[Maria BieÈu]], one of the leading world's sopranos and the winner of the Japan International Competition; pianist [[Mark Zeltser]], winner of the USSR National Competition, Margueritte Long Competition in Paris and Busoni Competition in Bolzano, Italy.

Most retail businesses close on [[New Year's Day]] and [[Independence Day (Republic of Moldova)|Independence Day]], but remain open on all other holidays. [[Christmas]] is celebrated either on 7 January, the traditional date in [[Old Calendarists]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, or on 25 December, with both dates being recognized as public holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moldova Declares Western Christmas Day Official Holiday|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-celebrates-western-christmas/25206410.html|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{main|Sport in Moldova}}
''[[TrÃ®ntÄ]]'' (a form of [[wrestling]]) is the national sport in Moldova. [[Association football]] is the most popular team sport.

[[Rugby union]] is popular as well. Registered players have doubled, and almost 10,000 spectators turn up at every [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]] match.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most prestigious [[cycling race]] is the [[Moldova President's Cup]], which was first run in 2004.

Athletes from Moldova have won European medals in [[Track and field|Athletics]], [[Biathlon]], [[Football]] and [[Gymnastics]], World medals in [[Archery]], [[Judo]], [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] and [[Taekwondo]], as well as [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals in [[Boxing]], [[Canoeing]], [[Shooting]], [[Olympic weightlifting|Weightlifting]] and [[Wrestling]].

== History ==
The term "molecular epidemiology" was first coined by Kilbourne in a 1973 article entitled "The molecular epidemiology of influenza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kilbourne ED |title=The molecular epidemiology of influenza |journal=J Infect Dis |date=Apr 1973 |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=478â87 |pmid=4121053 |doi=10.1093/infdis/127.4.478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more formalized with the formulation of the first book on ''Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice'' by Schulte and Perera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice |last1=Schulte |first1= Paul A. |last2=Perera |first2=Frederica P. |year=1993 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=0-12-632346-1 |pages=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of this book is the impact of advances in molecular research that have given rise to and enable the measurement and exploitation of the [[biomarker]] as a vital tool to link traditional molecular and epidemiological research strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in populations.

== Modern use ==
While most molecular epidemiology studies are using conventional disease designation system for an outcome (with the use of exposures at the molecular level), compelling evidence indicates that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous process differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual ("the unique disease principle"),&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; considering uniqueness of the [[exposome]] and its unique influence on [[Molecular pathology|molecular pathologic]] process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman ME, Howatt W, Blows FM, Pharoah P, Hewitt SM, Garcia-Closas M. Molecular pathology in epidemiologic studies: a primer on key considerations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19(4):966-972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science. Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:659-667.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "molecular epidemiology" for this type of research masked the presence of these challenges, and hindered the development of methods and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller LH. Invited commentary: the 21st century epidemiologist--a need for different training? Am J Epidemiol 2012;176(8):668-671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Beck AH, King EE, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Ogino et al. respond to "The 21st century epidemiologist". Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:672-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the premise that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes.

== Analytical methods ==
The genome of a bacterial species fundamentally determines its identity. Thus, [[gel electrophoresis]] techniques like [[pulsed-field gel electrophoresis]] can be used in molecular epidemiology to comparatively analyze patterns of bacterial chromosomal fragments and to elucidate the genomic content of bacterial cells. Due to its widespread use and ability to analyse epidemiological information about most bacterial pathogens based on their molecular markers, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is relied upon heavily in molecular epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Goering, R.|title= Pulsed field gel electrophoresis: A review of application and interpretation in the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease |journal= Infection, Genetics and Evolution |date= 6 August 2010 |volume= 10|issue= 7 |pages= 866â875|pmid= 20692376|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Molecular epidemiology allows for an understanding of the molecular outcomes and implications of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposure, particularly how these choices and exposures result in acquired genetic mutations and how these mutations are distributed throughout selected populations through the use of biomarkers and genetic information. Molecular epidemiological studies are able to provide additional understanding of previously-identified [[risk factor]]s and disease mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728â729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific applications include:
* Molecular surveillance of disease risk factors
* Measuring the geographical and temporal distribution of disease risk factors
* Characterizing the evolution of pathogens and classifying new pathogen species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2014|title=Strengthening the Reporting of Molecular Epidemiology for Infectious Diseases (STROME-ID): an extension of the STROBE statement|journal=Lancet Infect Dis|volume=14|issue=4|pages=341â352|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70324-4|pmid=24631223|author=Field, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
While the use of advanced molecular analysis techniques within the field of molecular epidemiology is providing the larger field of epidemiology with greater means of analysis, [[Miquel Porta]] identified several challenges that the field of molecular epidemiology faces, particularly selecting and incorporating requisite applicable data in an unbiased manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Incomplete overlapping of biological, clinical, and environmental information in molecular epidemiological studies: a variety of causes and a cascade of consequences|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=734â738|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.734|pmid=1732039|author=Porta, M.|pmc=1732039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations of molecular epidemiological studies are similar in nature to those of generic epidemiological studies, that is, samples of convenience - both of the target population and genetic information, small sample sizes, inappropriate statistical methods, poor quality control, and poor definition of target populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728â729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As trade in sandalwood declined, it was replaced by a new business enterprise, "[[blackbirding]]", a euphemism for taking Melanesian or Western Pacific Islanders from New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, [[Vanuatu|New Hebrides]], New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands into indentured or forced labour in the sugar cane plantations in [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] by various methods of trickery and deception.&lt;ref name="kanaka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/14373/HERMES_2002_32-33_191.pdf?sequence=1 |title=De Kanaka Ã  Kanak: l'appropriation d'un terme gÃ©nÃ©rique au profit de la revendication identitaire |author=FrÃ©dÃ©ric Angleviel |publisher=UniversitÃ© de la Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackbirding was practiced by both French and British-Australian traders, but in New Caledonia's case, the trade in the early decades of the twentieth century involved relocating children from the [[Loyalty Islands]] to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture. New Caledonia's primary experience with blackbirding revolved around a trade from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture, mines, as well as guards over convicts and in some public works.  The historian Dorothy Shineberg's milestone study, The People Trade, discusses this 'migration'. In the early years of the trade, coercion was used to lure Melanesian islanders onto ships. In later years indenture systems were developed; however, when it came to the French slave trade, which took place between its Melanesian colonies of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, very few regulations were implemented. This represented a departure from the British experience, since increased regulations were developed to mitigate the abuses of blackbirding and 'recruitment' strategies on the coastlines.

The first missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] and the [[Marist Brothers]] arrived in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="abcau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/places/country/new_caledonia.htm |title=Charting the Pacific â Places |website=Abc.net.au |date=1998-10-13 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1849, the crew of the American ship ''Cutter'' was killed and eaten by the Pouma clan.&lt;ref name="logan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leanne Logan|author2=Geert Cole|title=New Caledonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lly95WF8n-cC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-86450-202-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannibalism]] was widespread throughout New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="Knauft1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

=== French dependency ===
On 24 September 1853, under orders from Emperor [[Napoleon III]], Admiral [[Auguste Febvrier Despointes|Febvrier Despointes]] took formal possession of New Caledonia. Captain [[Louis-Marie-FranÃ§ois Tardy de Montravel]] founded [[Port-de-France]] (NoumÃ©a) on 25 June 1854.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; A few dozen free settlers settled on the west coast in the following years.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; New Caledonia became a [[penal colony]] in 1864, and from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897, France sent about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners to New Caledonia. The ''Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale des prisons'' for 1888 indicates that 10,428 convicts, including 2,329 freed ones, were on the island as of 1 May 1888, by far the largest number of convicts detained in French overseas penitentiaries.&lt;ref&gt;As compared to 4,053 convicts, including 1,176 freed ones, in French Guiana at the same date. ''Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale des prisons'', Paris, 1888, p. 980&lt;/ref&gt; The convicts included many [[Communards]], arrested after the failed [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, including [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-LuÃ§ay |Henri de Rochefort]] and [[Louise Michel]].&lt;ref name="gb-1"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Robert Aldrich|author2= John Connell|title= France's Overseas Frontier: DÃ©partements et territoires d'outre-mer|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vRB3woPa7LAC&amp;pg=PA46 |year= 2006|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn= 978-0-521-03036-6|page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1873 and 1876, 4,200 political prisoners were "relegated" to New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; Only 40 of them settled in the colony; the rest returned to France after being granted amnesty in 1879 and 1880.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt;

[[File:King Jacques and his Queen.jpg|thumb|Chief "King Jacques" and his Queen]]
In 1864 [[nickel]] was discovered{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} on the banks of the [[Diahot River]]; with the establishment of the [[SociÃ©tÃ© Le Nickel]] in 1876, mining began in earnest.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; To work the mines the French imported labourers from neighbouring islands and from the New Hebrides, and later from [[Japan]], the [[Dutch East Indies]], and [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt; The French government also attempted to encourage European immigration, without much success.&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt;

The indigenous population or Kanak people were excluded{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} from the French economy and from mining work, and ultimately confined to reservations.&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt; This sparked a violent reaction in 1878, when High Chief Atal of [[La Foa]] managed to unite many of the central tribes and launched a guerrilla war that killed 200 Frenchmen and 1,000 Kanaks.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; A second guerrilla war took place in 1917, with Catholic missionaries like [[Maurice Leenhardt]] functioning as witnesses to the events of this war. Leenhardt would pen a number of ethnographic works on the Kanak of New Caledonia. Noel of Tiamou led the 1917 rebellion, which resulted in a number of orphaned children, one of whom was taken into the care of Protestant missionary Alphonse Rouel. This child, Wenceslas Thi, would become the father of [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Muckle&lt;/ref&gt; (1936â1989).

Europeans brought new diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], which caused the deaths of many natives.&lt;ref name="logan"/&gt; The Kanak population declined from around 60,000 in 1878 to 27,100 in 1921, and their numbers did not increase again until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt;

In June 1940, after the [[fall of France]], the [[General councils (France)|''Conseil General'']] of New Caledonia voted unanimously to support the [[Free French]] government, and in September the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] governor was forced to leave for Indochina.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; In March 1942, with the assistance of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/30/chapters/06.pdf |title= Hasluck: Clearing A Way To Total War |format= PDF |accessdate= 6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the territory became an important [[Allies of World War II | Allied]] base,&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; and the main South Pacific Fleet base of the [[United States Navy]] in the South Pacific moved to Noumea in 1942â1943.&lt;ref name="Rottman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author= Gordon L.

American troops numbered as many as 50,000, the equivalent of the contemporary population.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt;

=== French overseas territory ===
In 1946, New Caledonia became an overseas territory.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; By 1953, [[French citizenship]] had been granted to all New Caledonians, regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"/&gt;

The European and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] populations gradually increased in the years leading to the nickel boom of 1969â1972, and the indigenous [[Kanak people|Kanak]] Melanesians became a minority, though they were still the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"&gt;{{Britannica|411221|New Caledonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1976 and 1988, conflicts between French government actions and the Kanak independence movement saw periods of serious violence and disorder.&lt;ref name="ped" /&gt; In 1983, a statute of "enlarged autonomy" for the territory proposed a five-year transition period and a referendum in 1989. In March 1984, the Kanak resistance, Front IndÃ©pendantiste, seized farms and the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS) formed a provisional government. In January 1985, the French Socialist government offered sovereignty to the Kanaks and legal protection for European settlers. The plan faltered as violence escalated. The government declared a state of emergency; however, regional elections went ahead, and the FLNKS won control of three out of four provinces. The centre-right government elected in France in March 1986 began eroding the arrangements established under the Socialists, redistributing lands mostly without consideration of native land claims, resulting in over two-thirds going to Europeans and less than a third to the Kanaks. By the end of 1987, roadblocks, gun battles and the destruction of property culminated in the [[OuvÃ©a cave hostage taking]], a dramatic hostage crisis on the eve of the presidential elections in France. Pro-independence militants on [[OuvÃ©a]] killed four gendarmes and took 27 hostage. The military response resulted in nineteen Kanak deaths and another three deaths in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/land-and-independence-new-caledonia|title=Land and Independence in New Caledonia|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]], signed on 26 June 1988, ensured a decade of stability. The [[NoumÃ©a Accord]] signed 5 May 1998, set the groundwork for a 20-year transition that gradually transfers competences to the local government.&lt;ref name="ped" /&gt;

Following the timeline set by the NoumÃ©a Accord that stated a vote must take place by the end of 2018, the groundwork was laid for a [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 2018|referendum on full independence from France]] at a meeting chaired by the French Prime Minister [[Ãdouard Philippe]] on 2 November 2017, to be held by November 2018. Voter list eligibility had been a subject of a long dispute, but the details have since been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2017/11/03/referendum-d-autodetermination-en-nouvelle-caledonie-un-accord-politique-trouve_5209433_823448.html|title=Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie : ce que contient l'" accord politique " sur le rÃ©fÃ©rendum d'autodÃ©termination|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=17 July 2018|date=2017-11-03|last1=Roger|first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2018, the government announced an [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 2018|independence referendum]] that was held and failed on 4 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/new-caledonia-sets-date-independence-referendum-france|title=New Caledonia sets date for independence referendum|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5444523/new-caledonia-france-referendum/|title=New Caledonia Votes to Remain Part of France|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of New Caledonia}}
[[File:Flag of New Caledonia Congress.gif|thumb|Logo of the Territorial Congress]]

New Caledonia is a [[sui generis collectivity|territory]] [[Sui generis#Politics and society|''sui generis'']] to which France has gradually transferred certain powers.&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt; As such its   citizens have [[French nationality law|French nationality]] and vote for the [[president of France]]. They have the right to vote in elections to the [[European Parliament]]. It is governed by a 54-member [[Congress of New Caledonia|Territorial Congress]], a legislative body composed of members of three provincial assemblies.&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; The French State is represented in the territory by a [[Colonial and Departmental Heads of New Caledonia|High Commissioner]].&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; At a national level, New Caledonia is represented in the [[French Parliament]] by two deputies and two senators.&lt;ref name="anom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/Simplifiez-vous-l-Etat/Elections/Les-differentes-elections/Les-differentes-elections|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111063921/http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/Simplifiez-vous-l-Etat/Elections/Les-differentes-elections/Les-differentes-elections|archivedate=2011-11-11 |title=Les diffÃ©rentes Ã©lections |language=French |website=Nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[French presidential election, 2012|2012 French presidential election]], the [[voter turnout]] in New Caledonia was 61.19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2012/000/988/index.html| title=Resultats de l'election presidentielle â Nouvelle Caledonie| first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] |language=French |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 25 years, the party system in New Caledonia was dominated by the anti-independence [[The RallyâUMP]].&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; This dominance ended with the emergence of a new party, [[Avenir Ensemble]], also opposed to independence, but considered more open to dialogue with the Kanak movement,&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; which is part of the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]], a coalition of several pro-independence groups.&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt;

=== Customary authority ===
The Kanak society has several layers of customary authority, from the 4,000â5,000 family-based clans to the eight customary areas (''aires coutumiÃ¨res'') that make up the territory.&lt;ref name="anaya2"&gt;[http://unsr.jamesanaya.org/docs/countries/2011-newcaledonia-a-hrc-18-35-add6_en.pdf The situation of Kanak people in New Caledonia, France. â Country Reports â UNSR James Anaya], page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Clans are led by clan chiefs and constitute 341 tribes, each headed by a tribal chief. The tribes are further grouped into 57 customary chiefdoms (''chefferies''), each headed by a head chief, and forming the administrative subdivisions of the customary areas.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt;

The Customary Senate is the assembly of the various traditional councils of the Kanaks, and has jurisdiction over the law proposals concerning the Kanak identity.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; The Customary Senate is composed of 16 members appointed by each traditional council, with two representatives per each customary area.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; In its advisory role, the Customary Senate must be consulted on law proposals "concerning the Kanak identity" as defined in the NoumÃ©a Accord.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; It also has a deliberative role on law proposals that would affect identity, the civil customary statute, and the land system.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; A new president is appointed each year in August or September, and the presidency rotates between the eight customary areas.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Les-Elus/Senat-coutumier |title=SÃ©nat coutumier |language=French |website=Nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr |accessdate=2013-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030174915/http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Les-Elus/Senat-coutumier |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanak people have recourse to customary authorities regarding civil matters such as marriage, adoption, inheritance, and some land issues.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt; The French administration typically respects decisions made in the customary system.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt; However, their jurisdiction is sharply limited in penal matters, as some matters relating to the customary justice system, including the use of [[Judicial corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], are seen as clashing with the human rights obligations of France.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt;

=== Military ===
The Armed Forces of New Caledonia ({{lang-fr|Forces armÃ©es de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie}}) '''FANC''', include about 2,000 soldiers, mainly deployed in [[Koumac]], [[NandaÃ¯, New Caledonia|NandaÃ¯]], [[La Tontouta International Airport|Tontouta]], [[Plum, New Caledonia|Plum]], and [[NoumÃ©a]].&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; The land forces consist of a regiment of the [[Troupes de marine]], the RÃ©giment d'infanterie de marine du Pacifique. The naval forces include two [[P400-class patrol vessel]]s, a [[BATRAL-class landing ship|BATRAL]], and a patrol boat of the [[Maritime Gendarmerie]].&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; The air force is made up of three [[Construcciones AeronÃ¡uticas SA|Casa]] transport aircraft, four [[AÃ©rospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]] helicopters and a [[Eurocopter Fennec|Fennec]] helicopter, based in Tontouta.&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; In addition, 760 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] are deployed on the archipelago.&lt;ref name="fanc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/forces-prepositionnees/nouvelle-caledonie/dossier/les-forces-armees-de-nouvelle-caledonie |title=Les Forces armÃ©es de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |language=French |website=Defense.gouv.fr |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status ===
Since 1986, the [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] has included New Caledonia on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml#1 Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories (1945â1999)] United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; An [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 1987|independence referendum]] was held the following year, but independence was rejected by a large majority.

The official name of the territory, ''Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie'', could be changed in the near future due to the accord, which states that "a name, a flag, an anthem, a motto, and the design of banknotes will have to be sought by all parties together, to express the Kanak identity and the future shared by all parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gouv.nc/static/pages/outils/telechargement/accordsNoumea.pdf| title=Les accords de NoumÃ©a|author=Government of New Caledonia| accessdate=11 August 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405032022/http://www.gouv.nc/static/pages/outils/telechargement/accordsNoumea.pdf |archivedate = 5 April 2008 |language=French |authorlink=Government of New Caledonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, however, there has been no consensus on a new name for the territory, although ''Kanak Republic'' is popular among 40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nouvellecaledonie.rfo.fr/article424.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627221108/http://nouvellecaledonie.rfo.fr/article424.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=27 June 2008| title=SociÃ©tÃ© : La Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie choisit un hymne et une devise| author=RFO| accessdate=11 August 2008| authorlink=RÃ©seau France Outre-mer| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Caledonia has increasingly adopted its own symbols, choosing an anthem, a motto, and a new design for its banknotes.&lt;ref name="monde1"/&gt; In July 2010, New Caledonia adopted the Kanak flag, alongside the existing [[French tricolor]], as [[Flag of New Caledonia|dual official flags of the territory]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|title=New Caledonia adopts second flag in compromise over French rule |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newcaledonia/7900494/New-Caledonia-adopts-second-flag-in-compromise-over-French-rule.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|quote=New Caledonian Congress overwhelmingly voted to adopt the emblem of the indigenous movement, which features red, blue and green stripes with a yellow sun and black totem, as the nation's second official flag}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption made New Caledonia one of the few countries or territories in the world with two official national flags.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The decision to use two flags has been a constant battleground between the two sides and led the coalition government to collapse in February 2011.&lt;ref name="fr24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110826-france-sarkozy-urges-dialogue-over-violence-new-caledonia-airfare-protests |title=Sarkozy calls for dialogue over New Caledonia violence |publisher=France 24 |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutional organization is the result of the organic law and ordinary law passed by the Parliament on 16 February 1999.&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt;

The archipelago is divided into three provinces:
* [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] (''province Sud''). Provincial capital: [[NoumÃ©a]]. Area 9,407&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Population: 183,007 inhabitants (2009).
* [[North Province, New Caledonia|North Province]] (''province Nord''). Provincial capital: [[KonÃ©, New Caledonia|KonÃ©]]. Area: 7,348&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Population: 45,137 inhabitants (2009).
* [[Loyalty Islands Province]] (''province des Ã®les LoyautÃ©''). Provincial capital: [[Lifou]]. Area: 1,981&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Population: 17,436 inhabitants (2009).

New Caledonia is further divided into 33 municipalities:&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outre-mer.gouv.fr/?presentation-nouvelle-caledonie.html&amp;artpage=3-3 |title=PrÃ©sentation â L'Outre-Mer |website=Outre-mer.gouv.fr |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One commune, [[Poya, New Caledonia|Poya]], is divided between two provinces. The northern half of Poya, with the main settlement and most of the population, is part of the North Province, while the southern half of the commune, with only 127 inhabitants in 2009, is part of the South Province.

[[File:New Caledonia - S199828000484.jpg|thumb|left|New Caledonia from space]]
{{Main|Geography of New Caledonia}}
New Caledonia is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a fragment of the ancient [[Gondwana]] super-continent. It is speculated that New Caledonia separated from Australia roughly 66 million years ago, subsequently drifting in a north-easterly direction, reaching its present position about 50 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer &amp; Giribet 2007: 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainland is divided in length by a central mountain range whose highest peaks are [[Mont PaniÃ©]] ({{convert|1,629|m}}) in the north and [[Mont Humboldt]] ({{cvt|1,618|m}}) in the southeast.&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; The east coast is covered by a lush vegetation.&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; The west coast, with its large savannahs and plains suitable for farming, is a drier area. Many ore-rich massifs are found along this coast.&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt;

The [[Diahot River]] is the longest river of New Caledonia, flowing for some {{convert|100|km}}.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Britannica|161133|Diahot River}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a catchment area of {{cvt|620|km2}} and opens north-westward into the [[Baie d'Harcourt]], flowing towards the northern point of the island along the western escarpment of the Mount PaniÃ©.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl;jsessionid=9C07FFA7400A6C3C823F1ACAF98A3D9D?a=d&amp;d=HASH01e0de34b153f45530bc1736.5.pp&amp;c=ccgi&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |title=The impacts of opencast mining in New Caledonia |publisher=The [[United Nations University]] |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215730/http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl;jsessionid=9C07FFA7400A6C3C823F1ACAF98A3D9D?a=d&amp;d=HASH01e0de34b153f45530bc1736.5.pp&amp;c=ccgi&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the island is covered by wet evergreen forests, while savannahs dominate the lower elevations.&lt;ref name="gbrs"/&gt; The New Caledonian lagoon, with a total area of {{convert|24000|km2}} is one of the largest lagoons in the world. It is surrounded by the [[New Caledonia Barrier Reef]].&lt;ref name="geo-jc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Donnees-Geographiques |title=DonnÃ©es GÃ©ographiques |language=French |website=Nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr |accessdate=2013-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030174815/http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Donnees-Geographiques |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], with a hot and humid season from November to March with temperatures between 27&amp;nbsp;Â°C and 30&amp;nbsp;Â°C,&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; and a cooler, dry season from June to August with temperatures between 20&amp;nbsp;Â°C and 23&amp;nbsp;Â°C,&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; linked by two short interstices.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; The tropical climate is strongly moderated by the oceanic influence and the [[trade winds]] that attenuate humidity, which can be close to 80%.&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt;  The average annual temperature is 23&amp;nbsp;Â°C, with historical extremes of 2.3&amp;nbsp;Â°C and 39.1&amp;nbsp;Â°C.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt;

The rainfall records show that precipitation differs greatly within the island. The {{convert|3000|mm}} of rainfall recorded in [[Galarino]] are three times the average of the west coast. There are also dry periods, because of the effects of [[El NiÃ±o]].&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; Between December and April, [[tropical depressions]] and [[cyclones]] can cause winds to exceed a speed of {{convert|100|kph}}, with gusts of {{convert|250|kph}} and very abundant rainfall.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; The last cyclone affecting New Caledonia was [[2016-17 South Pacific cyclone season#Severe Tropical Cyclone Cook|Cyclone Cook]], in January 2017.

[[File:Landscape, south of New Caledonia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Landscape, south of New Caledonia]]
New Caledonia has many unique taxa, especially birds and plants.&lt;ref name="hjnc"/&gt; It has the richest diversity in the world per square kilometre.&lt;ref name="hjnc"/&gt; In its botany not only species but entire [[genus|genera]] and even [[Family (biology)|families]] are unique to the island, and survive nowhere else. The biodiversity is caused by Grande Terre's central mountain range, which has created a variety of niches, landforms and micro-climates where endemic species thrive.&lt;ref name="hjnc"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leanne Logan|author2=Geert Cole|title=New Caledonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lly95WF8n-cC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-86450-202-2|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Van Peteghem]] was in 2001 awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] for his efforts on behalf of the Caledonian ecological protection movement in the face of "serious challenges" from [[Jacques Lafleur]]'s [[Rally for Caledonia in the Republic|RPCR]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/169 Bruno Van Peteghem] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201050426/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/169 |date=1 February 2009 }}, Goldman Environmental Prize website&lt;/ref&gt; Progress has been made in a few areas in addressing the protection of New Caledonia's ecological diversity from fire, industrial and residential development, unrestricted agricultural activity and mining (such as the judicial revocation of [[INCO]]'s mining license in June 2006 owing to claimed abuses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningwatch.ca/index.php?/New_Caledonia/Goro_Licence_Revoked "Indigenous Kanaks Take On Inco in New Caledonia"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013113126/http://www.miningwatch.ca/index.php?%2FNew_Caledonia%2FGoro_Licence_Revoked |date=13 October 2007 }}, MiningWatch Canada, 19 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

More of tropical [[gymnosperm]] species are endemic to New Caledonia than to any similar region on Earth. Of the 44 indigenous species of gymnosperms, 43 are endemic, including the only known parasitic gymnosperm (''[[Parasitaxus usta]]'').&lt;ref name="futura1"/&gt; Also, of the 35 known species of ''[[Araucaria]]'', 13 are endemic to New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="hjnc"/&gt; New Caledonia also has the world's most divergent lineage of [[flowering plant]], ''[[Amborella|Amborella trichopoda]]'', which is at, or near, the base of the clade of all flowering plants.

The world's largest extant species of [[fern]], ''[[Cyathea intermedia]]'', also is endemic to New Caledonia. It is very common on acid ground, and grows about one meter (yard) per year on the east coast, usually on fallow ground or in forest clearings. There also are other species of ''[[Cyathea]]'', notably ''[[Cyathea novae-caledoniae]]''.&lt;ref name="ncd2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.futura-sciences.com/fr/doc/t/zoologie-1/r/nouvelle-caledonie/d/la-faune-et-la-flore-de-nouvelle-caledonie_468/c3/221/p3/ |title=La flore de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie â DeuxiÃ¨me partie |website= Futura-sciences.com |date= 2004-08-18 |accessdate= 2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 documentary by [[Al Jazeera English]] asserted that up to 10%{{dubious|date=September 2015}} of New Caledonia's population is descended from around 2,000 [[Arabs|Arab]]-[[Imazighen|Berber]] people deported from [[French Algeria]] in the late 19th century to [[Penal colony|prisons on the island]] in reprisal for the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871. After serving their sentences, they were released and given land to own and cultivate as part of colonisation efforts on the island. As the overwhelming majority of the [[Algerians of the Pacific|Algerians imprisoned on New Caledonia]] were men, the community was continued through intermarriage with women of other ethnic groups, mainly French women from nearby women's prisons. Despite facing both assimilation into the Euro-French population and discrimination for their ethnic background, descendants of the deportees have succeeded in preserving a common identity as Algerians, including maintaining certain cultural practices (such as Arabic names) and in some cases [[Islam]]ic religion. Some travel to Algeria as a rite of passage, though obtaining Algerian citizenship is often a difficult process. The largest population of Algerian-Caledonians lives in the commune of [[Bourail]] (particularly in the [[:fr:Nessadiou|Nessadiou]] district, where there is an Islamic cultural centre and [[:fr:CimetiÃ¨re des Arabes de Nessadiou|cemetery]]), with smaller communities in [[NoumÃ©a]], [[ConnÃ©]], [[Blambut]], and [[SuriantÃ©]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2015/09/exile-caledonia-150914145540415.html|title=Exile In New Caledonia|last1=Mame|first1=Abdelkader|first2=Abdelaziz|last2=Abid|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 September 2015}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qsr-FjZhEM video]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of New Caledonia}}

The [[French language]] began to spread with the establishment of French settlements, and French is now spoken even in the most secluded villages. The level of fluency, however, varies significantly across the population as a whole, primarily due to the absence of universal access to public education before 1953, but also due to immigration and ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name="rl-lang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac-noumea.nc/sitevr/spip.php?rubrique48 |title=Situation linguistique en Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |publisher=Vice-Rectorat de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 census, 97.3% of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak, read and write French, whereas only 1.1% reported that they had no knowledge of French.&lt;ref name="cen-lang"&gt;[http://www.isee.nc/population/telecharxls/don.cadrage-rp-09.xls Principales caractÃ©ristiques des individus de 15 ans et plus, par province de rÃ©sidence et sexe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030182817/http://www.isee.nc/population/telecharxls/don.cadrage-rp-09.xls |date=30 October 2012 }}. isee.nc. Retrieved on 2013-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant language communities among immigrant populations are those of [[Wallisian]] and [[Javanese language]] speakers.

The 28 [[Kanak languages]] spoken in New Caledonia are part of the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] group of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.&lt;ref name="macc"&gt;[http://www.alk.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/alk/langues AcadÃ©mie des Langues Kanak â Langues] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109131824/http://www.alk.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/alk/langues# |date=9 November 2017 }}. alk.gouv.nc&lt;/ref&gt; Kanak languages are taught from kindergarten (four languages are taught up to the bachelor's degree) and an academy is responsible for their promotion.&lt;ref name="maskan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisonnouvellecaledonieparis.nc/site/population.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426023621/http://www.maisonnouvellecaledonieparis.nc/site/population.php |archivedate=2009-04-26 |title=La Population De Nouvelle-Caledonie |publisher=La maison de la Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |language=French |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four most widely spoken indigenous languages are [[Drehu]] (spoken in [[Lifou]]), [[Nengone language|Nengone]] (spoken on [[MarÃ©]]) and [[PaicÃ®]] (northern part of Grande Terre).&lt;ref name="maskan"/&gt; Others include [[Iaai language|Iaai]] (spoken on [[OuvÃ©a]]). At the 2009 census, 35.8% of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak (but not necessarily read or write) one of the indigenous [[Melanesian languages]], whereas 58.7% reported that they had no knowledge of any of them.&lt;ref name="cen-lang"/&gt;

=== Religion ===
The predominant religion is [[Christianity]]; half of the population is [[Roman Catholic]], including most of the Europeans, Uveans, and Vietnamese and half of the Melanesian and Polynesian minorities.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"/&gt; Roman Catholicism was introduced by French colonists. The island also has numerous [[Protestant]] churches, of which the [[Free Evangelical Church]] and the [[Evangelical Church in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands]] have the largest number of adherents; their memberships are almost entirely Melanesian.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"/&gt; Protestantism gained ground in the late 20th century and continues to expand. There are also numerous other Christian groups and small numbers of Muslims.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"/&gt; See [[Islam in New Caledonia]] and [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith in New Caledonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Noumea is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of NoumÃ©a]]

== Education ==
Education in New Caledonia is based on the [[Education in France|French curriculum]] and delivered by both French teachers and Frenchâtrained teachers. Under the terms of the 1998 [[NoumÃ©a Accord]], primary education is the responsibility of the three provinces. As of 2010, secondary education was in the process of being transferred to the provinces.&lt;ref name="CSC Australia 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Pacific Leaders Dialogue 2010 New Caledonia Report|url=http://www.cscaustralia.com/ep10/reports/Study%20Tour%20Report,%20New%20Caledonia%20April%20'10.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth Study Conferences Australia|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of schools are located in [[NoumÃ©a]] but some are found in the islands and the north of New Caledonia. When students reach high school age, most are sent to NoumÃ©a to continue their secondary education. Education is compulsory from the age of six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is education like in New Caledonia?|url=https://newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/what-is-education-like-in-new-caledonia/|website=New Caledonia Today|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=March 2018}}

New Caledonia's main tertiary education institution is the [[University of New Caledonia]] (''UniversitÃ© de la Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie''), which was founded in 1993 and comes under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation]]. It is based in NoumÃ©a and offers a range of vocational, Bachelor, MA, and PhD programmes and courses. The University of New Caledonia consists of three academic departments, one institute of technology, one PhD school, and one teacher's college. As of 2013, the University has approximately 3,000 students, 107 academics, and 95 administrative and library staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation UNC en Anglais 2012|url=http://unc.nc/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/presentation-UNC-english-1.pdf|publisher=[[University of New Caledonia]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSC Australia 2010" /&gt; Many New Caledonian students also pursue scholarships to study in metropolitan France. As part of the NoumÃ©a Accord process, a ''Cadre Avenir'' provides scholarships for Kanak professionals to study in France.&lt;ref name="CSC Australia 2010" /&gt;

=== Nickel sector ===
{{main|Nickel mining in New Caledonia}}

[[File:Creek South New Caledonia.JPG|thumb|A creek in southern New Caledonia. Red colors reveal the richness of the ground in [[iron oxide]]s and nickel.]]

New Caledonian soils contain about 25% of the world's [[nickel]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/1446693/Nickel-gleams-again-in-New-Caledonia.html "Nickel gleams again in New Caledonia"], ''Metal Bulletin'', 3 December 2001 â though other articles in Wikipedia say 10% or 16%&lt;/ref&gt; The [[late-2000s recession]] has gravely affected the nickel industry, as the sector faced a significant drop in nickel prices (â31.0% year-on-year in 2009) for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name="comptes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isee.nc/compteco/telechargement/4pagecerom2011.pdf |title=Les comptes Ã©conomiques rapides de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie |publisher=ISEE.nc |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall in prices has led a number of producers to reduce or stop altogether their activity, resulting in a reduction of the global supply of nickel by 6% compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt;

This context, combined with bad weather, has forced the operators in the sector to revise downwards their production target.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt; Thus, the activity of mineral extraction has declined by 8% in volume year on year.{{when|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="comptes" /&gt; The share of the nickel sector as a percentage of GDP fell from 8% in 2008 to 5% in 2009.&lt;ref name="comptes" /&gt; A trend reversal and a recovery in demand have been recorded early in the second half of 2009, allowing a 2.0% increase in the local metal production.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt;

Historically, nickel was transported by wire ropeway to ships waiting offshore.

Due to low levels of domestic horticulture, fresh tropical fruits feature less highly in New Caledonian cuisine than in other Pacific nations, instead relying on rice, fish and root vegetables such as taro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/what-do-people-eat-in-new-caledonia/ | website=Newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com |title=What Do People Eat in New Caledonia? |accessdate=16 February 2014| date=2013-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this is frequently prepared is in a buried-oven-style feast, known as ''[[Bougna]]''. Wrapped in banana leaves, the fish, taro, banana and other seafood are buried with hot rocks to cook, then dug up and eaten.

[[File:Olympic Swimming Marathon (7769099394).jpg|thumb|right|Olympic Broadcasting Services' cameraman, covering the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics â Men's marathon 10 kilometre|men's 10 kilometre marathon swim]] at the [[2012 Olympic Games]]]]
'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the worldâs longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] emerged as an independent [[sovereign state]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, [[James VI and I|James VI]], [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]], became [[List of English monarchs#House of Stuart|King of England]] and [[Monarchy of Ireland#Monarchs of Ireland|King of Ireland]], thus forming a [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the three kingdoms]]. Scotland subsequently entered into a [[political union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] on 1 May 1707 to create the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mackie/&gt; The union also created a new [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which succeeded both the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. In 1801, Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (in 1922, the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|renamed]] the United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parliament and Ireland|year= |publisher=The Houses of Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/|location=London |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Scotland, the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of [[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, J.

{{main|Etymology of Scotland}}

"Scotland" comes from ''[[Scoti]]'', the Latin name for the [[Gaels]]. Philip Freeman has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an [[Indo-European root]], *''skot'', citing the parallel in Greek ''skotos'' (ÏÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï), meaning "darkness, gloom".&lt;ref&gt;P. Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', Austin, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA93 93].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Late Latin]] word ''[[Scotia]]'' ("land of the Gaels") was initially used to refer to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RlF7sq48n4C&amp;pg=PA16 |title=The History Of Ireland|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014|isbn=9781113155177|last1=Gwynn|first1=Stephen|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 11th century at the latest, ''Scotia'' was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the [[River Forth]], alongside ''Albania'' or ''Albany'', both derived from the Gaelic ''[[Alba]]''.&lt;ref name="Brewer"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ayto | first = John |author2=Ian Crofton | title = Brewer's Britain &amp; Ireland: The History, Culture, Folklore and Etymology of 7500 Places in These Islands | publisher=WN | url = | isbn = 978-0-304-35385-9 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the words ''Scots'' and ''Scotland'' to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;

=== Early history ===
{{main|Prehistoric Scotland}}

{{see also|Timeline of prehistoric Scotland}}

Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the [[Mesolithic period]]. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the [[Last glacial period|last glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known evidence is a flint arrowhead from [[Islay]]. See Moffat, Alistair (2005) ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History''. London. Thames &amp; Hudson. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sites at [[Cramond]] dated to 8500 BC and near [[Kinloch Castle|Kinloch]], [[RÃ¹m]] from 7700 BC provide the earliest known evidence of human &lt;u&gt;occupation&lt;/u&gt; in Scotland. See [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410357 "The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: Rubbish dump reveals time-capsule of Scotland's earliest settlements"] megalithic.co.uk.

[[File:Skara Brae 12.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] settlement, located on the west coast of [[Mainland, Orkney]]]]

The groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of [[Skara Brae]] on the mainland of [[Orkney]] dates from this period. [[Neolithic]] habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Francis|title=Britain BC| publisher=HarperPerennial|location=London|year=2003|isbn=978-0-00-712693-4|pages=98â104 &amp; 246â250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 discovery in Scotland of a 4000-year-old tomb with burial treasures at [[Forteviot]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the capital of a [[Picts|Pictish]] Kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, is unrivalled anywhere in Britain.

The written [[protohistory]] of Scotland began with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]] in southern and central Great Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales, administering it as a province called ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]''. Roman invasions and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes.

According to the Roman historian [[Tacitus]], the [[Caledonians]] "turned to armed resistance on a large scale", attacking Roman forts and skirmishing with their [[Roman legion|legions]]. In a surprise night-attack, the Caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole [[9th Legion]] until it was saved by General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]]'s cavalry.&lt;ref name="The Romans in Scotland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/the_romans/ |title=The Romans in Scotland |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 83â84, Agricola defeated the Caledonians at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]. Tacitus wrote that, before the battle, the Caledonian leader, [[Calgacus]], gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the "last of the free" and accused the Romans of "making the world a desert and calling it peace" (freely translated).&lt;ref name="The Romans in Scotland"/&gt; After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the [[Gask Ridge]] close to the [[Highland Boundary Fault|Highland line]] (only [[Cawdor (Roman fort)|Cawdor]] near [[Inverness]] is known to have been constructed beyond that line). Three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the [[Southern Uplands]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, William S. ''The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes'', in Edwards, Kevin J. &amp; Ralston, Ian B.M. (Eds) (2003). ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archeology and History, 8000 BCâAD 1000.'' Edinburgh. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans erected [[Hadrian's Wall]] to control tribes on both sides of the wall&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Christopher A. |year=2003 |title=The Britons |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0-631-22260-6 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the ''[[Limes Britannicus]]'' became the northern border of the Roman Empire; although the army held the [[Antonine Wall]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] for two short periods â the last during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] from 208 until 210.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Anne S.

The Roman military occupation of a significant part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years, although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by [[Brython]]ic tribes such as the [[Votadini]] and [[Damnonii]], would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] term [[Hen Ogledd]] ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]]-speaking people around AD 500 to 800.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kingdom of [[DÃ¡l Riata]] was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/scotland/western/article_5.shtml Dalriada: The Land of the First Scots]".

''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, some archaeologists have argued against this view, saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell&gt;Campbell, Ewan.

The [[Kingdom of the Picts]] (based in [[Fortriu]] by the 6th century) was the state that eventually became known as "Alba" or "Scotland". The development of "Pictland", according to the historical model developed by [[Peter Heather]], was a natural response to Roman imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, "State Formation in Europe in the First Millennium A.D.", in Barbara Crawford (ed.), ''Scotland in Dark Ages Europe'', (Aberdeen, 1994), pp. 47â63&lt;/ref&gt; Another view places emphasis on the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]], and the reign of [[Bridei III|Bridei m. Beli]] (671â693), with another period of consolidation in the reign of [[Ãengus I|Ãengus mac Fergusa]] (732â761).&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Alex Woolf]], "The Verturian Hegemony: a mirror in the North", in M. P. Brown &amp; C. A. Farr, (eds.), ''Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', (Leicester, 2001), pp. 106â11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of the Picts  in the early 8th century, when [[Bede]] was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1107â1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, [[Kenneth I of Scotland|CinÃ¡ed mac AilpÃ­n]] (Kenneth MacAlpin).&lt;ref name=Lynch_359&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Kenneth mac Alpin|last=Brown|first=Dauvit|editor=M.

From a base of territory in eastern Scotland north of the [[River Forth]] and south of the [[River Oykel]], the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the [[Old English|English]]-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Galloway]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]]-speaking [[Caithness]]; by the end of the 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.

The push for this change was the reign of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and the [[Davidian Revolution]]. Feudalism, government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns (called [[burgh]]s) began in this period. These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis, whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, while the rest of the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Withers|first=Charles, W.J.|title=Gaelic in Scotland, 1698â1981|publisher=John Donald |location=Edinburgh |year=1984 |pages=16â41 |isbn=978-0-85976-097-3 |authorlink=Charles W.

The death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in March 1286, followed by that of his granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], broke the centuries-old succession line of Scotland's kings and shattered the 200-year golden age that began with David I. [[Edward I of England]] was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the Scottish crown, and he organised a process known as the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Great Cause]] to identify the most legitimate claimant. [[John Balliol]] was pronounced king in the Great Hall of [[Berwick Castle]] on 17 November 1292 and inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 30 November, [[St. Andrew's Day]]. Edward I, who had coerced recognition as [[Lord Paramount of Scotland]], the feudal superior of the realm, steadily undermined John's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/utk/scotland/conquered.htm |title=Scotland Conquered, 1174â1296 |publisher=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Instead, the Scottish parliament sent envoys to France to negotiate an alliance. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the [[Auld Alliance]] (1295â1560). War ensued and King John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. [[Andrew Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in what became known as the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] (1296â1328).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/utk/scotland/regained.htm |title=Scotland Regained, 1297â1328 |publisher=National Archives of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the struggle changed significantly when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick]], killed his rival [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] on 10 February 1306 at [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Dumfries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King Robert the Bruce|first=A.

Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece. Victory at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, [[Edward Bruce]], brother of the King, was briefly appointed [[High King of Ireland]] during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], won the support of [[Pope John XXII]], leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.

The war with England continued for several decades after the death of Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, [[David II of Scotland|David II's]] lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] to come to the throne and establish the [[Stewart Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Barrow&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=G.

The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].

This period was the height of the Franco-Scottish alliance. The Scots Guard â la [[Garde Ãcossaise]] â was founded in 1418 by [[Charles VII of France]].

In 1502, [[James IV of Scotland]] signed the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] with [[Henry VII of England]]. He also married Henry's daughter, [[Margaret Tudor]], setting the stage for the [[Union of the Crowns]].

In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland]] attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the [[Darien scheme]]. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs.

With trade tariffs with England now abolished, trade blossomed, especially with [[Colonial America]].

The deposed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Stuart]] claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-[[Presbyterian]]s, including Roman Catholics and [[Episcopalian Protestants]]. However, two major Jacobite risings launched in [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] failed to remove the [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the [[Battle of Culloden]], Great Britain's last [[pitched battle]].

Historian Neil Davidson notes "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland." Davidson also states "far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland â or more precisely, the Lowlands â lay at its core."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =The Origins of Scottish Nationhood | author =Neil Davidson(2000)| publisher =Pluto Press| location =London | pages =94â95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing [[Highland Clearances]], in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the [[Highland Potato Famine]] and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars. The behaviour of tenants and landlords varied, but overall the clearances were notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under [[Scots law]], the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of some evictions.&lt;ref&gt;E. Richards, ''The Highland Clearances: People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A.

As a result, during the period 1841â1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.&lt;ref name=Huston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii&gt;R.

[[File:Disruption forming Free Kirk.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The Disruption Assembly; painted by [[David Octavius Hill]].]]
After prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]], known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843â1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Robb1990&gt;G. Robb, "Popular Religion and the Christianization of the Scottish Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries", ''Journal of Religious History'', 1990, 16(1): 18â34.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterian Church]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1â5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), pp. 416â7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic emancipation]] in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, mainly to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt;

Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.&lt;ref name=Devine2001p91-100&gt;T.

=== Early 20th century ===

Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914â2000'' (2006), pp 1â33&lt;/ref&gt; With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston and W. W. J. Knox, eds. ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (2001) p 426.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VI5nAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=casualties] [[Niall Ferguson]] points out in "The Pity of War" that the proportion of enlisted Scots who died was third highest in the war behind Serbia and Turkey and a much higher proportion than in other parts of the UK.[https://books.google.com/books?ei=AJtPTtinKseKhQfUufnzBg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=QrYhAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=niall+ferguson&amp;q=enlisted] [http://news.scotsman.com/worldwarone/39Savage-Scots39-wish-you-weren39t.6487746.jp]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] was Britain's commander on the Western Front.

The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "[[Red Clydeside]]" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] stronghold, the industrial districts switched to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] by 1922, with a base among the [[Irish Catholic]] working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead, a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914â2000'' (2006), pp 34â72&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Finlay, "National identity in Crisis: Politicians, Intellectuals and the 'End of Scotland', 1920â1939", ''History'', June 1994, Vol. 79 Issue 256, pp 242â59&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by [[Nazi Germany]] largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines.&lt;ref name = "blitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/world_war2/scotlands_blitz/ |title=Primary History - World War 2 - Scotland's Blitz |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities such as [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.&lt;ref name = "blitz"/&gt; Perhaps the most significant air-raid in Scotland was the [[Clydebank Blitz]] of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area.&lt;ref name = "Clydebank blitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/clydebank_blitz/ |title=Scotland's Landscape : Clydebank Blitz |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 528 people were killed and 4,000 homes totally destroyed.&lt;ref name = "Clydebank blitz"/&gt;

Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when [[Rudolf Hess]] flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the [[Duke of Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Leasor ''Rudolf Hess: The Uninvited Envoy'' (Kelly Bray: House of Stratus, 2001), {{ISBN|0-7551-0041-7}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, [[Karlheinz Pintsch]], a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=168}} [[Albert Speer]] later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|p=240}} Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.

As in World War I, [[Scapa Flow]] in Orkney served as an important [[Royal Navy]] base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and [[Rosyth]] gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[East Lothian]].&lt;ref&gt;P.

Creswell, ''Sea Warfare 1939â1945'' (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2nd edn., 1967), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shetland]]'s relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the [[Shetland bus]] by which fishing boats helped Norwegians flee the [[Nazis]], and expeditions across the [[North Sea]] to assist resistance.&lt;ref&gt;D. Howarth, ''The Shetland Bus: A WWII Epic of Escape, Survival, and Adventure'' (Guilford, Delaware: Lyons Press, 2008), {{ISBN|1-59921-321-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p51/&gt; Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25% and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition.

=== Geology and geomorphology ===

{{Main|Geology of Scotland}}

[[File:The Cuillins on a still morning (9878281443).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Scottish Highlands]], located in the north west of Scotland]]

The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.

The [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].

A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.

The [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.

The [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=16 November 1990 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128062644/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |archivedate=28 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland â Standard Grade Bitesize Revision â Ask a Teacher â Geography â Physical â Question From PN |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotland Today Â» ITKT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today " ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=28 December 2006 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archivedate = 6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400â500&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

{{main|Climate of Scotland}}
[[File:Tiree 3.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tiree]], one of the sunniest locations in Scotland]]
The climate of Scotland is [[temperate]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as [[Labrador]], southern [[Scandinavia]], the Moscow region in Russia, and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] on the opposite side of [[Eurasia]]. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the coldest ever UK temperature of {{convert|-27.2|Â°C|Â°F|1}} recorded at [[Braemar]] in the [[Grampian Mountains]], on 11 February 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml |title=BBC Weather: UK Records|publisher=BBC.co.uk. |accessdate=21 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071307/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml|archivedate=2 December 2010}} The same temperature was also recorded in Braemar on 10 January 1982 and at [[Altnaharra]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], on 30 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Winter maxima average {{convert|6|Â°C|Â°F|0}} in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging {{convert|18|Â°C|Â°F|0}}.

The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic [[ocean currents]] and the colder surface temperatures of the [[North Sea]]. [[Tiree]], in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.&lt;ref name=Metext/&gt; Rainfall varies widely across Scotland.

Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times.

Scotland also has a significant [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] population, 19% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Collier, "Scotland's Confident Catholics", ''[[The Tablet]]'' 10 January 2009, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like [[Uist]] and [[Barra]], and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland.

The head of state of the United Kingdom is the monarch, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (since 1952). The [[regnal number]]ing ("Elizabeth II") caused [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Scottish controversy|controversy]] around the time of her coronation because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. The British government stated in April 1953 that future British monarchs would be numbered according to either their English or their Scottish predecessors, whichever number would be higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/apr/15/royal-style-and-title |title=Hansard vol 514 cc 199â201 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=15 April 1953 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, any future King James would be styled James VIII{{mdash}}since the last Scottish King James was [[James VII of Scotland|James VII]] (also James II of England, etc.){{mdash}}while the next King Henry would be King Henry IX throughout the UK even though there have been no Scottish kings of that name. A legal action, [[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]] (1953 SC 396), was brought in Scotland to contest the right of the Queen to entitle herself "Elizabeth II" within Scotland, but [[the Crown]] won the case.

The monarchy of the United Kingdom continues to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal coat of arms]] used in Scotland together with its associated [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]], royal titles including that of [[Duke of Rothesay]], certain [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]], the [[chivalric order|chivalric]] [[Order of the Thistle]] and, since 1999, reinstating a ceremonial role for the [[Crown of Scotland]] after a 292-year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/newsandmediacentre/100237.aspx|publisher=Scottish Parliament|title=Opening of Parliament: Procession of the Crown of Scotland|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland has limited [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom, as well as representation in the UK Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] in Edinburgh since 1999. The UK Parliament retains control over [[reserved matters]] specified in the [[Scotland Act 1998]], including UK taxes, social security, defence, international relations and broadcasting.&lt;ref name=Gate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/government/index.html |title=Government of Scotland Facts |publisher= |accessdate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503130512/http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/government/index.html |archivedate=3 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially had only a limited power to [[Scottish variable rate|vary income tax]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/brown-opens-door-to-holyrood-tax-powers-1.828436|title=Brown opens door to Holyrood tax powers|publisher= |work=Sunday Herald|date=16 February 2008|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of [[Scotland Act 2012|2012]] and [[Scotland Act 2016|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35470086 |title=Scotland's tax powers: What it has and what's coming? |first=Douglas |last=Fraser |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=2 February 2016 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the UK Parliament by passing a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Scotland News Online "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm Scotland begins pub smoking ban]", ''BBC Scotland News'', 26 March 2006.

The Scottish Parliament is a [[unicameral]] legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a [[first-past-the-post]] system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the [[additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]]. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally five years from 2011â16). The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the Monarch to serve as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]]. Other ministers are appointed by the First Minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People |title=People: Who runs the Scottish Government |publisher=Scottish Government|date=21 November 2014 |accessdate= 11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister, who is accountable to the [[Scottish Parliament]] and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The First Minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]], currently [[John Swinney]] MSP, who deputises for the First Minister during a period of absence of overseas visits. Alongside the Deputy First Minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility. Swinney is also currently [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People/Ministers/Deputy-First-Minister |title=Deputy First Minister |publisher=Gov.scot |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Government's cabinet comprises nine cabinet secretaries, who form the [[Scottish Cabinet|Cabinet of Scotland]]. There are also twelve other ministers, who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.gov.scot |title=The Scottish Government |publisher=Beta.gov.scot |date= |accessdate=11 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809110318/https://beta.gov.scot/ |archive-date=9 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, junior ministers do not attend cabinet meetings.

In the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 election]], the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) won 63 of the 129 seats available. [[Nicola Sturgeon]], the leader of the SNP, has been the First Minister since November 2014. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] became the largest opposition party in the 2016 elections, with the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]], [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Green Party|Green Party]] also represented in the Parliament.

Scotland is represented in the British House of Commons by 59 MPs elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies.

===Devolved government relations===

[[File:First Minister meets the Prime Minister at Bute House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Theresa May]] and First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, meeting at [[Bute House]] in 2016]]

The relationships between the central UK Government and devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are based on the extra-statutory principles and agreements with the main elements are set out in a ''Memorandum of Understanding'' between the UK government and the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The MOU lays emphasis on the principles of good communication, consultation and co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/devolution-of-powers-to-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland |title=Devolution of powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since devolution in 1999, Scotland has devolved stronger working relations across the two other devolved governments, the [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various events such as the British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that are devolved to each government.&lt;ref name="gov.scot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/topics/archive/About-Archive/11556 |title=Scottish/UK relations |publisher=Gov.scot |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, along with the Welsh Government, British Government as well as the Northern Ireland executive, participate in the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which allows each government to discuss policy issues together and work together across each government to find solutions. The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations.&lt;ref name="gov.scot"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union in 2016, the Scottish Government has called for there to be a joint approach from each of the devolved governments. In early 2017, the devolved governments met to discuss Brexit and agree on Brexit strategies from each devolved government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38670128 |title=Devolved administrations hold 'difficult' Brexit talks |publisher=BBC News |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lead for [[Theresa May]] to issue a statement that claims that the devolved governments will not have a central role or decision making process in the Brexit process, but that the UK Government plans to "fully engage" Scotland in talks alongside the governments of Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-devolved-government-scotland-northern-ireland-wales-eu-negotiation-talks-article-50-a7552421.html |title=Devolved governments won't get decisive role in Brexit talks Theresa May confirms |publisher=The Independent |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, McConnell and the then Scottish Executive pioneered the way forward to launch what would become the [[Scotland Malawi Partnership]] which co-ordinates Scottish activities to strengthen existing links with [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotland-malawipartnership.org/who-we-are/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Scotland Malawi Partnership |date=3 November 2005 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During McConnell's time as First Minister, several relations with Scotland, including Scottish and Russian relations strengthened following a visit by [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to [[Edinburgh]].

=== Constitutional changes ===

[[File:Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber 2.jpg|thumb|right|The debating chamber within the [[Scottish Parliament Building]]]]

A policy of [[devolution]] had been advocated by the three main UK parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history. A previous Labour leader. [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the "settled will of the Scottish people".&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, Michael (2001) ''[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/aspect/docs/aspectcampaigns.htm The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament]''. [[University of Strathclyde]]. Retrieved 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The devolved Scottish Parliament was created after a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum in 1997]] found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to [[Scottish variable rate|vary income tax]]. The constitutional status of Scotland is nonetheless subject to ongoing debate.

The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports [[Scottish independence]], was first elected to form the Scottish Government in [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007]]. The new government established a "[[National Conversation]]" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, [[federation|federalism]], or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. In rejecting the last option, the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament created a [[Calman Commission|commission]] to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7195800.stm |title=Party people confront new realities |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scotland Act 2012]], based on proposals by the commission, was subsequently enacted devolving additional powers to the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://breakingnews.heraldscotland.com/breaking-news/?mode=article&amp;site=hs&amp;id=N0403941296156340260A |title=Commons clears transfer of power |website=The Herald|location=Glasgow |date=January 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Scotland}}
[[File:00 104 0403 Glasgow - Rathaus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Glasgow City Chambers]], seat of [[Glasgow City Council]]]]
Historical subdivisions of Scotland included the [[mormaerdom]], [[stewartries|stewartry]], [[earldom]], [[burgh]], [[Civil parishes in Scotland|parish]], [[Counties of Scotland|county]] and [[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions and districts]]. Some of these names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors.

Modern Scotland is subdivided in various ways depending on the purpose. In local government, there have been 32 single-tier council areas since 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940039_en_1.htm "Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301043228/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940039_en_1.htm |date=1 March 2010 }} Office of Public Sector Information. Retrieved 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; whose councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors who are elected at [[Elections in Scotland|local elections]] every five years. The head of each council is usually the [[Lord Provost]] alongside the Leader of the Council,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosla.gov.uk/councils/leaders&lt;/ref&gt; with a Chief Executive being appointed as director of the council area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosla.gov.uk/councils/chief-executives&lt;/ref&gt; Community Councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub-divisions within each council area.

In the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 constituencies. Until 2013, the Scottish fire brigades and police forces were based on a system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.

[[City status in the United Kingdom]] is conferred by [[letters patent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/city/cityhome.htm|title=City status|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven cities in Scotland: [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Inverness]], [[Stirling]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/city/citygj.htm|title=UK Cities|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 October 2009, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the [[Lawnmarket]]. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp "Court Information"] www.scotcourts.gov.uk. Retrieved 26 September 207. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320151120/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp |date=20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[District Courts of Scotland|District courts]] were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by [[Justice of the Peace Court]]s from 2008 to 2010. The [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] regulates heraldry.

For three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: "guilty", "not guilty" and "''[[not proven]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]], typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of [[double jeopardy]]. There is, however, the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]] â see the provisions of the [[Double jeopardy#Scotland|Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011]]. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. [[Manslaughter]], in England and Wales, is broadly similar to [[culpable homicide]] in Scotland, and arson is called [[wilful fire raising]]. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scotland-s-unique-15-strong-juries-will-not-be-abolished-1-1037747 |title=Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=11 May 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care in Scotland is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947]] (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales.

In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about Â£30,000 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx |title=About the NHS in Scotland |publisher= |access-date=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628224652/http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx |archivedate=28 June 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of [[North Sea oil]] have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland.

Although Scotland has a long military tradition predating the [[Treaty of Union]] with England, its armed forces now form part of the [[British Armed Forces]], with the exception of the [[Atholl Highlanders]], Europe's only legal private army. In 2006, the infantry regiments of the [[Scottish Division]] were amalgamated to form the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]. Other distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the [[Scots Guards]], the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] and the [[154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC]], an Army Reserve Regiment of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]].

Because of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments.&lt;ref&gt;The large number of military bases in Scotland led some to use the euphemism "Fortress Scotland".

Young Students are defined as those under 25, without children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees exist for those outside the young student definition, typically from Â£1,200 to Â£1,800 for undergraduate courses, dependent on year of application and type of qualification.

[[St Andrew's Day]], 30 November, is the [[national day]], although [[Burns' Night]] tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the [[St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007]], designating the day an official [[bank holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/en2007/2007en02.htm "Explanatory Notes to St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007"] Office of Public Sector Information.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Scottish cuisine}}

[[File:Cock-a-leekie Soup.jpg|thumb|[[Cock-a-leekie soup]]]]

Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine]] as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of [[Game (food)|game]], dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of [[spice]]s from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. [[Irn-Bru]] is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as "Scotland's other national drink" (after whisky). During the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern era]], [[French cuisine]] played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the "[[Auld Alliance]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historichighlanders.com/auldfood.htm |title=The Auld Alliance and its Influence on Scottish Cuisine |author=Gail Kilgore |accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.

=== Football ===

[[File:Craig Levein issues instructions (5575660382).jpg|thumb|left|[[Scotland national football team]] in competition against Brazil, 2011]]

The world's first official international association football match was held in 1872 and was the idea of [[C. W. Alcock]] of [[the Football Association]] which was seeking to promote [[Association Football]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the Football Association of 3 October 1872, London&lt;/ref&gt; The match took place at the [[West of Scotland Cricket Club]]'s [[Hamilton Crescent]] ground in the [[Partick]] area of [[Glasgow]]. The match was between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] and resulted in a 0â0 draw. Following this, the newly developed football became the most popular sport in Scotland. The [[Scottish Cup]] was first contested in 1873. [[Queen's Park F.C.]], in Glasgow, is probably the oldest association football club in the world outside England.

The [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the second-oldest national football association in the world, is the main [[sport governing body|governing body]] for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) which governs the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. As a result of this key role in the development of the sport Scotland is one of only four countries to have a permanent representative on the IFAB; the other four representatives being appointed for set periods by [[FIFA]]. 

The SFA also has responsibility for the [[Scotland national football team]], whose supporters are commonly known as the "[[Tartan Army]]". As of August 2018, Scotland are ranked as the 40th best [[List of men's national football teams|national football team]] in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].

The [[East Coast Main Line|East Coast]] and [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]] main railway lines connect the major cities and towns of Scotland with each other and with the rail network in England. [[London North Eastern Railway]] provides inter-city rail journeys between [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]] to London. Domestic rail services within Scotland are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. During the time of [[British Rail]], the West Coast Main Line from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] was electrified in the early 1970s, followed by the East Coast Main Line in the late 1980s. British Rail created the [[ScotRail (brand)|ScotRail brand]]. When British Rail existed, many railway lines in Strathclyde were electrified. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive was at the forefront with the acclaimed "largest electrified rail network outside London". Some parts of the network are electrified, but there are no electrified lines in the Highlands, Angus, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Dundee or Aberdeen, or Perth &amp; Kinross, and none of the islands has a rail link (although the railheads at [[Kyle of Lochalsh]] and [[Mallaig]] principally serve the islands).

The East Coast Main Line crosses the [[Firth of Forth]] by the [[Forth Bridge]]. Completed in 1890, this [[cantilever bridge]] has been described as "the one internationally recognised Scottish landmark".&lt;ref&gt;Keay, J. &amp; Keay, J.

Ferries serving both the inner and outer [[Hebrides]] are principally operated by the [[state-owned enterprise]] [[Caledonian MacBrayne]].

Services to the [[Northern Isles]] are operated by [[Serco]]. Other routes, served by multiple companies, connect southwest Scotland to [[Northern Ireland]]. [[DFDS Seaways]] operate a freight-only service from [[Rosyth]], near Edinburgh, to [[Zeebrugge]], Belgium.

Additional routes are operated by local authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12811">The '''Senior Foreign Service''' ('''SFS''') comprises the top four ranks of the [[United States Foreign Service]].  These ranks were created by the [[United_States_Foreign_Service#Foreign_Service_Act_of_1980|Foreign Service Act of 1980]] and [[s:Executive Order 12293|Executive Order 12293]] in order to provide the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] with senior grades [[General Schedule#Military rank equivalency|equivalent]] to general- and flag [[Military rank|ranks]] in the military and naval establishments, respectively, and to grades in the [[Senior Executive Service]].  Like military ranks and other Foreign Service ranks, the Senior Foreign Service grade system assigns rank in person, not rank in position.

==Grade structure==
The four grades, from highest to lowest, with their military and former Senior Executive Service  equivalents (i.e., prior to the SES's shift to an open-range compensation system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.opm.gov/oca/compmemo/2004/sesconvreg.asp|title=Senior Executive Service Pay and Performance Awards|last=|first=|date=2004|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104314/https://archive.opm.gov/oca/compmemo/2004/sesconvreg.asp|archive-date=2018-03-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;), are:

|-
| Minister Counselor (FE-MC) || O-8 || ES-4, ES-5
|-

|}

Only one of these ranks, Career Ambassador, is established by law.  The Foreign Service Act of 1980 stipulates, "The President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, confer the personal rank of career ambassador upon a career member of the Senior Foreign Service in recognition of especially distinguished service over a sustained period."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Service Act of 1980, Section 302(2)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, the 1980 Act states the President shall "prescribe salary classes for the Senior Foreign Service and shall prescribe an appropriate title for each class."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Service Act of 1980, Section 402&lt;/ref&gt;  President Ronald Reagan established the other three Senior Foreign Service ranks with [[s:Executive Order 12293|Executive Order 12293]].

===Protocol===
According to McCaffree's ''Protocol: The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official &amp; Social Usage'', Career Ministers of the Senior Foreign Service are to be accorded the honorific "The Honorable".  Career Ambassadors, as ambassadors, are accorded the honorific "Her/His Excellency".&lt;ref&gt;McCaffree, ''Protocol: The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official &amp; Social Usage''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Foreign Service pay system is an open-range, performance-based pay system that is linked to the [[Senior Executive Service]] (SES) pay system. SFS members, like SES members, are not entitled to automatic across-the-board increases and locality-based comparability payments. Instead, pay adjustments are based on a memberâs individual performance and/or contribution to the agencyâs performance.

As amended under 5 U.S.C. 5376, Executive Order 12293 prescribes three SFS salary classes linked to the [[Executive Schedule]], ranging from 120 percent of the pay rate for a GS-15, step 1 to the pay rate for ES-II:

: Career Minister (CM) with a pay cap equal to the rate of pay for ES-II (Note: Career Ambassador (CA) SFS members are also paid within the CM rate range);

: Minister-Counselor (MC) with a pay cap equal to 1.07 times the rate of pay for ES-III; and

: Counselor (OC) with a pay cap equal to 1.02 times the rate of pay for ES-III.&lt;ref name="state-paycard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/dghr/pay/|title=State Department Pay Scales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Executive Order originally prescribed three SFS salary classes linked to the SES as follows:

: Career Minister (CM) with a range from 94 percent of the rate payable to level III of the [[Executive Schedule]] to 100 percent of the rate payable to level II of the Executive Schedule;

: Minister-Counselor (MC) with a range from 90 percent of the rate payable to level III of the Executive Schedule to 100 percent of the rate payable to level III of the Executive Schedule; and

: Counselor (OC), with a range from 120 percent of the rate payable to GSâ15, step 1 to 100 percent of the rate payable to level III of the Executive Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plumbook/2008/2008_plum_book.pdf United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807034324/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plumbook/2008/2008_plum_book.pdf |date=2009-08-07 }}, page 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to creation of the Senior Foreign Service (i.e., prior to implementation of the Foreign Service Act of 1980) Career Ministers were paid at the same rate as Class 1 Foreign Service Officers.  In 1979, an FSO-1 earned from $61,903 to $65,750 per annum, with the caveat that civil service and Foreign Service salaries were capped at $50,112.50 per annum, equal to the pay rate for Level V of the Executive Schedule, per Section 5308 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code.  The top theoretical annual salary, $65,750, was equal to that of a GS-18.&lt;ref&gt;Department of State Salary Chart 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to passage of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the [[Rogers Act]] and subsequently the [[United_States_Foreign_Service#Foreign_Service_Act_of_1946|Foreign Service Act of 1946]] had established a grade system from FSS-22 up to FSO-1. A single âseniorâ grade, Career Minister, was established by the 1946 Act for Foreign Service Officers who had served with noteworthy distinction in ambassadorships or other, equivalent positions (usually as Assistant Secretary or Under Secretary of State). Since Career Ministers were paid at the same rate as senior FSO-1s, however, the âpromotionâ was merely symbolic.

The rank of Career Ambassador &lt;blockquote&gt;"was first established by an Act of Congress on Aug 5, 1955, as an amendment to the Foreign Service Act of 1946. Under its provisions, the President with the advice and consent of the Senate was empowered to appoint individuals to the class who had (1) served at least 15 years in a position of responsibility in a government agency, including at least 3 years as a Career Minister; (2) rendered exceptionally distinguished service to the government; and (3) met other requirements prescribed by the Secretary of State."&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/principalofficers/career-ambassador State Department: Career Ambassadors.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ambassadors were appointed as a rule from the ranks of FSO-2s and FSO-1s, with very senior ambassadorships going to the relatively rare Career Ministers and exceedingly rare Career Ambassadors. Following reform of the civil service in 1949, when the [[General Schedule]] with its three âsupergradesâ (GS-16 through GS-18) was created, and then following creation of the Senior Executive Service in 1978, however, Foreign Service Officers in senior policy positions found themselves regularly equated to mid-level counterparts in the military and the civil service. The 1980 Act sought in part to redress this imbalance in perceived status versus level of authority and responsibility.

==Functions==
The intent of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 in establishing the Senior Foreign Service was to create a cadre of senior, policy-level foreign affairs professionals on a par with the senior, policy-level officers of the military and naval establishments, and with the civil service-based Senior Executive Service, which had been formed a few years prior. The 1980 Act describes the Senior Foreign Service as the "corps of leaders and experts for the management of the Service and the performance of its functions."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Service Act of 1980, Section 103(3)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act provides, moreover, that for promotion into and within the Senior Foreign Service, the precepts used by selection boards (the bodies responsible for recommending promotions and involuntary separations of underperformers) "shall emphasize performance which demonstrates the strong policy formulation capabilities, executive leadership qualities, and highly developed functional and area expertise" requisite for these positions.&lt;ref&gt;22 U.S. Code Â§ 4003&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their eligibility to serve in ambassadorships, SFS officers serve in senior positions in U.S. diplomatic missions (e.g., as deputy chief of mission, as head of section in a large embassy, or as consul general in a large consulate general) as well as in headquarters positions in their respective [[United_States_Foreign_Service#Foreign_affairs_agencies|foreign affairs agencies]].

==Eligibility and time in class==
In order to be promoted into the Senior Foreign Service, an FS-1 Foreign Service Officer or Specialist must "open his/her window", that is, must formally request in writing consideration for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service.  This application starts a clock; if the officer is not promoted into the Senior Foreign Service within a specific number of convocations of Selection Boards (set by regulation in each foreign affairs agency), the officer is mandatorily retired.

Like the rest of the Foreign Service, as well as their military counterparts, Senior Foreign Service officers are subject to time-in-class provisions.  If not promoted within a specific "time in class" for the rank encumbered, the officer is mandatorily retired.  The time in class for each grade varies both by grade and by foreign affairs agency, and is established by agency regulation.  Times in class are now cumulative, so that early promotion to higher grades no longer leads to rapid retirement of rapidly rising officers.

These stipulations ensure flow-through of the senior ranks of the service, a specific goal of the rank-in-person Foreign Service personnel system.&lt;ref name="kopp"&gt;Kopp and Gillespie, ''Career Diplomacy'', pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsj1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Up or Out|first=Henry|last=Schmick|publisher=Foreign Service Journal|date=April 2010|url=http://www.foreignservicejournal-digital.com/foreignservicejournal/201004/#pg56|work=V.P.

The number of states [[Head of state|headed]] by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] has varied during her {{age|1952|2|6}} years on the throne, altogether seeing her as [[sovereign]] of a total of 32 independent countries during this period. In her capacity as Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] (including the [[British overseas territory#Current overseas territories|British overseas territories]]), she is also monarch of three [[Crown dependencies]]â[[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], and [[Isle of Man|Man]]âand, in her capacity as Queen of [[New Zealand]], she is monarch of two [[associated states]]âthe [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]âsince they acquired this status in 1965 and 1974, respectively.

Two situations in two countries differ from the others. The government of the [[List of historical unrecognized states and dependencies|unrecognised state]] of [[Rhodesia]] proclaimed its allegiance to Elizabeth II as queen of [[Rhodesia]] from 1965 to 1970. However, she did not accept either the role or the title and it was not accepted or recognised by any other state. [[Fiji]] became a republic through a military [[1987 Fijian coups d'Ã©tat|coup in 1987]], after which its [[Great Council of Chiefs]] continued to recognise Elizabeth II as [[Monarchy of Fiji|queen]], or [[Monarchy of Fiji|Paramount Chief of Fiji]], until the council's de-establishment on 14 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/6573396/Fijis-Great-Council-of-Chiefs-abolished {{full|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was only a ceremonial title, with no role in government at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=2883| title=Fiji chiefs say Britain's Elizabeth still Queen of Fiji| date=19 November 2002| publisher=Radio New Zealand International| accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stockpiles may be in the form of capsules or simply as the [[active pharmaceutical ingredient]], which is stored in sealed drums and, when needed, dissolved in water to make a bitter-tasting, clear liquid.&lt;ref name="pmid15709056"&gt;{{cite journal

There are no [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based guidelines]] to guide the use of these stockpiled drugs,&lt;ref name="pmid17182341" /&gt; and plans are based on assumed similarities to seasonal influenza.  The most common antivirals are [[neuraminidase inhibitors]], which, if begun during the first 48 hours after symptoms appear, will reduce the duration of seasonal influenza by about one day.  Taken before symptoms appear, it may prevent disease in about three-quarters of people treated prophylactically.&lt;ref name="pmid17115954"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Harrod ME, Emery S, Dwyer DE |title=Antivirals in the management of an influenza pandemic

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, this is recommended in institutionalized elderly people and other high-risk groups as a form of [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] during seasonal influenza outbreaks.&lt;ref name="pmid14753128" /&gt;  However, since pandemic influenza differs somewhat from normal seasonal influenza, it is not clear that these drugs will prove either safe or effective for their intended purpose.&lt;ref name="pmid17115954" /&gt;

For a person that has very recently been exposed to seasonal influenza, effective post-exposure prophylaxis generally requires taking a drug like [[oseltamivir]] for seven to ten days, at half the daily dose needed for treatment.  A person that is repeatedly exposed, such as hospital staff members, may require continuous treatment throughout the duration of the outbreak in a community.  Based on experience with seasonal influenza in [[nursing homes]], control of influenza requires full treatment of any ill persons and prophylactic treatment of all their contacts.  In a pandemic situation, before a vaccine becomes available, this level of treatment and medical prevention may require providing drugs to 80% of the people in an affected community.&lt;ref name="pmid15709056" /&gt;  Consequently, very large supplies of the drugs must be made available â much larger supplies than could be produced on demand.  Stockpiles are generally arranged in advance by government health authorities, due to fear of shortages and an awareness of manufacturing limitations during an outbreak.&lt;ref name="pmid15709056" /&gt;

It is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the [[United Nations]].

The [[geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]], formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|aborigines]] before the 17th century, when [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After a brief rule by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the island was annexed in 1683 by the [[Qing dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. The Qing ceded Taiwan to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1895 after the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. While Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the [[Republic of China (1912â1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was established on the mainland in 1912 after the [[Xinhai Revolution|fall of the Qing dynasty]]. Following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender to the Allies]] in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the ROC's loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued to [[Two Chinas|claim to be the legitimate government of China]], its effective jurisdiction had, since the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island|loss of Hainan in 1950]], been limited to [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and several small islands]], with the main island making up 99% of its ''de facto'' territory. As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC represented [[China and the United Nations|China at the UN]] until 1971, when it [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|lost its seat]] to the PRC.

In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of [[Taiwan Miracle|rapid economic growth]] and [[industrialization]], creating a [[developed country|stable industrial economy]]. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from a [[one-party state|one-party]] military dictatorship dominated by the [[Kuomintang]] to a [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|multi-party democracy]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. Taiwan is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|22nd-largest economy]] in the world, and its [[high-tech]] industry plays a key role in the global economy.

The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its [[One-China policy]] the PRC refuses [[diplomatic relations]] with any country that [[diplomatic recognition|recognizes]] the ROC. Today, 17 countries maintain [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|official ties with the ROC]] but many other states maintain unofficial ties through [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|representative offices]] and institutions that function as [[de facto embassy|de facto embassies]] and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a [[non-state actor]]. Internally, the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual [[Chinese unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]], though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal. The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200503/14/eng20050314_176746.html |title=Full text of Anti-Secession Law |work=People's Daily |date=14 March 2005 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC and ROC standoff dates from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and has extended through the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|first]], [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis|second]] and [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|third]] Taiwan Strait crises to the present day.

Various names for the island of Taiwan remain in use today, each derived from explorers or rulers during a particular historical period. The name Formosa ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:wikt:ç¦ç¾æ©æ²|ç¦ç¾æ©æ²]]}}) dates from 1542,{{check|date=December 2015}} when [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors sighted an uncharted island and noted it on their maps as ''Ilha Formosa'' ("beautiful island").&lt;ref name="yb:history"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 3: History |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch03.pdf |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514004941/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch03.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2012 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npm.gov.tw/exhbition/formosa/english/02.htm National Palace Museum, Taiwan: 'The Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the Seventeenth Century'&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Formosa" eventually "replaced all others in European literature"{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=10|ps=: "A Dutch navigating officer named [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten|Linschotten]] [sic], employed by the Portuguese, so recorded the island in his charts, and eventually the name of Formosa, so euphonious and yet appropriate, replaced all others in European literature."}} and remained in common use among English speakers into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;see for example:

In the early 17th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a commercial post at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]], [[Tainan]]) on a coastal sandbar called "Tayouan",{{sfnp|Valentijn|1903|p=52}} after their [[ethnonym]] for a nearby [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal]] tribe, possibly [[Taivoan people]], written by the Dutch and Portuguese variously as ''Taiouwang'', ''Tayowan'', ''Teijoan'', etc.&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mair |first=V. H. |authorlink=Victor H. Mair |date=2003 |title=How to Forget Your Mother Tongue and Remember Your National Language |url=http://pinyin.info/readings/mair/taiwanese.html |quote=The true derivation of the name "Taiwan" is actually from the ethnonym of a tribe in the southwest part of the island in the area around Ping'an. As early as 1636, a Dutch missionary referred to this group as Taiouwang. From the name of the tribe, the Portuguese called the area around Ping'an as Tayowan, Taiyowan, Tyovon, Teijoan, Toyouan, and so forth. Indeed, already in his ship's log of 1622, the Dutchman [[Cornelis Reijersen]] referred to the area as Teijoan and Taiyowan. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular, [[Hokkien]], as {{zh|poj={{linktext|TÄi-oÃ¢n}}/{{linktext|TÃ¢i-oÃ¢n}}}}) as the name of the sandbar and nearby area ([[Tainan]]). The modern word "Taiwan" is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|å¤§å¡}}, {{linktext|å¤§å}}, {{linktext|å¤§ç£}}, {{linktext|èºå¡}}, {{linktext|èºå}}}} and {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|èºçª©ç£}}}}) in Chinese historical records. The area occupied by modern-day Tainan represented the first permanent settlement by both European colonists and Chinese immigrants. The settlement grew to be the island's most important trading centre and served as its capital until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|èºç£}}}}) was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

In his ''[[Daoyi ZhilÃ¼e]]'' (1349), [[Wang Dayuan]] used "[[Liuqiu]]" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it closest to [[Penghu]].{{sfnp|Thompson|1964|p=166}}
Elsewhere, the name was used for the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in general or [[Okinawa]], the largest of them; indeed the name ''RyÅ«kyÅ«'' is the Japanese form of ''LiÃºqiÃº''.
The name also appears in the ''[[Book of Sui]]'' (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even [[Luzon]].{{sfnp|Thompson|1964|p=163}}

The official name of the state is the "Republic of China"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form "China" (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|ZhÅngguÃ³}}'' ({{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|ä¸­å}}}}}})) to refer to itself, which derives from ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|zhÅng}}'' ("central" or "middle") and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guÃ³}}'' ("state, nation-state"),{{efn|Although this is the present meaning of ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guÃ³}}'', in [[Old Chinese]] (when its pronunciation was something like {{nowrap|/*qÊ·Ë¤Ék/}})&lt;ref name=bs&gt;[[Reconstructions of Old Chinese|Baxter-Sagart]].&lt;/ref&gt; it meant the walled city of the Chinese and the areas they could control from them.&lt;ref name=wilx/&gt;}} a term which also developed under the [[Zhou dynasty]] in reference to its [[demesne|royal demesne]],{{efn|Its use is attested from the 6th-century [[Classic of History]], which states "[[Tian (god)|Huangtian]] bestowed the lands and the peoples of the central state to the ancestors" ({{lang|zh|çå¤©æ¢ä»ä¸­åæ°è¶å¥çåäºåç}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|[[:s:zh:å°æ¸|ãå°æ¸ã]], [[:s:zh:å°æ¸/æ¢æ|æ¢æ]].}} {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the name was then applied to the area around [[Luoyi]] (present-day Luoyang) during the [[Eastern Zhou]] and then to China's [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].&lt;ref name=wilx&gt;{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion |title=Chinese History: A Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2000 |location=[[Cambridge, Mass.|Cambridge]] |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |series=Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph No. 52 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;pg=PA132 132] |isbn=9780674002494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had withdrawn to Taiwan upon losing the [[Chinese Civil War]], it was commonly referred to as "Nationalist China" (or "[[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]]") to differentiate it from "Communist China" (or "[[China|Red China]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garver|first=John W. |title=The Sino-American Alliance: Nationalist China and American Cold War Strategy in Asia|publisher=M.E.

Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China.{{sfnp|Jiao|2007|pp=91â94}} They are believed to be the ancestors of today's [[Taiwanese aborigines]], whose languages belong to the [[Austronesian language family]], but show much greater diversity than the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|rest of the family]], which spans a huge area from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] west to [[Madagascar]] and east as far as [[New Zealand]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]].

In 1624, the company established a stronghold called [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] on the coastal islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at [[Anping, Tainan]].&lt;ref name="Oosterhoff" /&gt;
When the Dutch arrived, they found southwestern Taiwan already frequented by a transient Chinese population numbering close to 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrade|first=Tonio |date=2007 |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/17552533/How-Taiwan-Became-Chinese-by-Tonio-Andrade-Project-Gutenberg-Edition |publisher=Columbia University Press |series=(Project Gutenberg Edition) |page=129 |isbn=978-9622090835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the 1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 [[chiefdom]]s ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under Dutch control, while others remained independent.&lt;ref name="Oosterhoff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Formosa Under the Dutch: Described from Contemporary Records, with Explanatory Notes and a Bibliography of the Island |year=1903 |first=William |last=Campbell |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary)|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner |url=https://archive.org/details/formosaunderdut01campgoog |pages=6â7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company began to import labourers from [[Fujian]] and [[Penghu]] (Pescadores), many of whom settled.&lt;ref name="Wills" /&gt;

In 1626, the [[Spanish Empire]] landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports of [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui]], as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.

Following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming loyalist, arrived on the island and [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|captured Fort Zeelandia]] in 1662, expelling the [[Dutch Empire]] and military from the island. Koxinga established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] (1662â1683), with his capital at [[Tainan]]. He and his heirs, [[Zheng Jing]], who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and [[Zheng Keshuang]], who ruled less than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland China well into the [[Qing dynasty]] era.&lt;ref name="Wills" /&gt;

=== Qing rule ===
{{Main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}
[[File:Taiwanese aboriginese deerhunt1.png|thumb|upright|Hunting deer, painted in 1746]]
In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral [[Shi Lang]] of southern [[Fujian]], the [[Qing dynasty]] formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province. The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area, issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan. The border between taxpaying lands and "savage" lands shifted eastward, with some aborigines becoming [[sinicized]] while others retreated into the mountains. During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of [[Han Chinese]] from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]], and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.

Northern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on 1 October 1884, but were [[Battle of Tamsui|repulsed from Tamsui]] a few days later. The French won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the [[Keelung Campaign]] ended in stalemate. The [[Pescadores Campaign]], beginning on 31 March 1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.

In 1887, the Qing upgraded the island's administration from [[Taiwan Prefecture]] of Fujian Province to [[Taiwan Province#History|Fujian-Taiwan-Province]], the twentieth in the empire, with its capital at [[Taipei]]. This was accompanied by a modernization drive that included building China's first railroad.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=247, 620}}

As the Qing dynasty was defeated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894â1895), Taiwan, along with [[Penghu]] and [[Liaodong Peninsula]], were ceded in full sovereignty to the [[Empire of Japan]] by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]].

After the [[Surrender of Japan]] on 25 October 1945, the [[US Navy]] ferried ROC troops to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces in [[Taipei]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], as part of [[General Order No. 1]] for temporary [[military occupation]]. General [[Rikichi AndÅ]], governor-general of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be "[[Retrocession Day|Taiwan Retrocession Day]]", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Although the [[1943 Cairo Declaration]] had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco and [[Treaty of Taipei]] Japan renounced all claim to them without specifying to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of the [[legal status of Taiwan]].

The ROC administration of Taiwan under [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such as [[hyperinflation]]. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government, while the mass movement led by the working committee of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

After the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communist Party of China, led by [[Mao Zedong]]. Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led to the capture of its capital [[Nanjing]] on 23 April and the subsequent defeat of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on 1 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kubek|first=Anthony |title=How the Far East was lost: American policy and the creation of Communist China|year=1963|isbn=978-0-85622-000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1949, after the loss of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and made Taipei the [[temporary capital]] of the ROC (also called the "wartime capital" by Chiang Kai-shek).&lt;ref name="wartime-capital"&gt;{{cite web |last=Huang |first=Fu-san |date=2010 |url=http://info.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=27358&amp;CtNode=2527&amp;mp=21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429070335/http://info.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=27358&amp;CtNode=2527&amp;mp=21 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |script-title=zh:èºç£ç°¡å²ï¼éº»éè®é³³å°çæäº |language=Chinese |trans-title=A Brief History of Taiwan: A Sparrow Transformed into a Phoenix |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China|accessdate=13 September 2009|quote={{lang|zh-hant|1949å¹´ï¼åæ°æ¿åºéå®èºç£å¾ï¼ä»¥èºåçºæ°æé¦é½}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers, members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier population of approximately six million.

After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang held remaining control of [[Tibet (1912â51)|Tibet]], the portions of [[Qinghai]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Yunnan]] provinces along with the [[Hainan Island]] until 1951 before the Communists subsequently captured these territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang's territory was reduced to Taiwan, [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] ([[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]), and two major islands of [[Dongsha Islands]] and [[Nansha Islands]]. The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all "China", which it defined to include [[mainland China]], Taiwan, [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of China|other areas]]. On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |work=PRC Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210182724/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|archivedate=10 February 2006 | quote = Section 1: Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, its regime has continued to use the designations 'Republic of China' and 'government of the Republic of China,' despite having long since completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty on behalf of China.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the United States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists. However, in 1950 the conflict between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], which had been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President [[Harry S. Truman]] intervened again and [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|dispatched the US Navy's 7th Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China.&lt;ref name=1950-US-DoD&gt;{{Cite journal|author=US Department of Defense |title=Classified Teletype Conference, dated 27 June 1950, between the Pentagon and General Douglas MacArthur regarding authorization to use naval and air forces in support of South Korea.

As the Chinese Civil War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous [[Central Cross-Island Highway]] through the [[Taroko Gorge]] in the 1950s. The two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number of [[Project National Glory|night raids]]. During the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in September 1958, Taiwan's landscape saw [[Nike-Hercules missile]] batteries added, with the formation of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until 1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike Hercules systems throughout the island.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth, known as the [[Taiwan Miracle]], was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds and demand for Taiwanese products.&lt;ref name="bbctimeline-coldwar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1955_1972.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline&amp;nbsp;â Cold war fortress|year=2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Makinen|Woodward|1989|ps=: "Yet, the Chinese Nationalist government attempted to isolate Taiwan from the mainland inflation by creating it as an independent currency area.

Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later, especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, most nations switched [[diplomatic recognition]] to the PRC (see [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]]).

Up until the 1970s, the government was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding [[martial law]], for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media. The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the KMT.

[[File:President Lee teng hui.png|thumb|right|180px|In 1988, [[Lee Teng-hui]] became the first Taiwan-born president of the Republic of China and was democratically elected in 1996.]]

[[Chiang Ching-kuo]], Chiang Kai-shek's son and successor as the president, began to liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his vice-president. In 1986, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT. A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the [[political status of Taiwan]] gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously, the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was [[taboo]].

After the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him and became the first Taiwan-born president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanese localization movement|localization]] in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan, and streamlining the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]] with most of its functions transferred to the [[Executive Yuan]]. Under Lee, the original members of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] (a former supreme legislative body defunct in 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It also called for general use of "Taiwan" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm|title=AP, Taiwan Party Asserts Separate Identity From China}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chen administration also pushed for referendums on [[Taiwanese cross-Strait relations referendum, 2004|national defense in 2004]] and [[Taiwanese United Nations membership referendums, 2008|UN entry in 2008]], both of which held on the same day as the presidential election.

The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan in the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2008|January 2008 legislative elections]], while its nominee [[Ma Ying-jeou]] went on to [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|win the presidency]] in March of the same year, campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a policy of "[[Special non-state-to-state relations|mutual nondenial]]".&lt;ref name="lam200803" /&gt; Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors of [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|possible corruption charges]]. Part of the rationale for campaigning for closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China attained since joining the [[World Trade Organization]]. However, some analysts say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-08-20-voa17-68706212/409333.html |title=Taiwan-China Economic Ties Boom, Military Tensions Remain {{!}} English |publisher=Voice of America |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] ruled that current marriage laws have been violating the Constitution by denying Taiwanese same-sex couples the right to marry. The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan does not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legitimate in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=J.

[[File:Taiwan NASA Terra MODIS 23791.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Taiwan is mostly mountainous in the east, with gently sloping plains in the west. The [[Penghu Islands]] are west of the main island.]]

The total area of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|current jurisdiction of the Republic of China]] is {{convert|36193|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/month/m1-01.xls |title=Number of Villages, Neighborhoods, Households and Resident Population |publisher=MOI Statistical Information Service |accessdate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329071215/http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/month/m1-01.xls |archivedate=29 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|137th-largest]] country/dependency, smaller than [[Switzerland]] and larger than [[Belgium]].

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35883|km2|0|abbr=on}}, and lies some {{convert|180|km}} from the southeastern coast of mainland China across the [[Taiwan Strait]].&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat" /&gt; The [[East China Sea]] lies to the north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, the [[Bashi Channel]] of the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to the south, and the [[South China Sea]] to the southwest.
Its shape is similar to a [[sweet potato]], giving rise to the slang term ''sweet potato'' used by [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] speakers to refer to people of native Taiwanese descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = Kang | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Marshall | year = 2000 | title = Nationalist Social Sciences and the Fabrication of Subimperial Subjects in Taiwan | journal = Positions | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 151â171 | doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-1-151 }} p. 167/&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling [[Chianan Plain]]s in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan's population. Taiwan's highest point is [[Yushan (mountain)|Yu Shan]] (Jade Mountain) at {{convert|3952|m}},{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=43}} making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]].

The [[Penghu Islands]], {{convert|50|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} west of the main island, have an area of {{convert|126.9|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}. More distant [[List of islands of Taiwan|islands of the Republic of China]] are the [[Kinmen]], [[Wuchiu]] and [[Matsu Islands]] off the coast of [[Fujian]], with a total area of {{convert|180.5|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, and the [[Pratas Islands]] and [[Taiping Island]] in the South China Sea, with a total area of {{convert|2.9|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and no permanent inhabitants.&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat" /&gt;
The ROC government also claims the [[Senkaku Islands]] to the northeast, which are controlled by Japan.

=== Climate ===
Taiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].&lt;ref name="cia-factbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Taiwan|work=CIA World Factbook|location=Langley, Virginia|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html|access-date=10 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

=== Geology ===
{{Main|Geology of Taiwan}}
[[File:DabajianMountain.jpg|thumb|[[Dabajian Mountain]]]]
The island of Taiwan lies in a complex [[tectonics|tectonic]] area between the [[Yangtze Plate]] to the west and north, the [[Okinawa Plate]] on the north-east, and the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]] on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84â86&lt;/ref&gt;

The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the "[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]" killed more than 2,400 people. The [[seismic hazard map]] for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/GSHAP/eastasia/asiafin.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303055258/http://seismo.ethz.ch/gshap/eastasia/asiafin.gif |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 March 2000 |title=USGS seismic hazard map of Eastern Asia |publisher=Seismo.ethz.ch |accessdate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate, referring to it as the "Taiwan Authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |work=PRC Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213045631/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|archivedate=13 February 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2014}} Section 1: "Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, although its regime has continued to use the designations "Republic of China" and "government of the Republic of China," it has long since completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty on behalf of mainland China and, in reality, has always remained only a separate state on the island of Taiwan."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and 400,000 troops in its armed forces."&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC has its own constitution, independently elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Bi-yu |date=2015 |title=Place, Identity, and National Imagination in Post-war Taiwan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgaUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=9781317658122&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=9781317658122&amp;f=false |location=Oxon, UK, and New York, USA |publisher=Routledge |pages=35â40, 46â60 |isbn=978-1-317-65812-2 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still exists as a state or a defunct state per [[international law]] due to the lack of wide [[diplomatic recognition]]. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken by [[TVBS]] in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the "status quo", while 19% favoured "independence" and 5% favoured "unification".&lt;ref name="tid-tvbs-survey" /&gt;

The political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible, as stated in its [[anti-secession law]], and for this reason there are substantial military installations on the [[Fujian]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/facility/liancheng.htm|title=Liancheng / Lianfeng Airbase&amp;nbsp;â Chinese Military Forces|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=7 June 2009|quote=In March 2000 it was reported that the PLA Air Force was deploying new air-defense missiles [possibly batteries of Russian-made S-300 missiles] opposite Taiwan at the coastal cities of Xiamen and Shantou, and at Longtian, near Fuzhou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2004NatDefRpt&gt;{{cite web|year=2004 |title=2004 National Defense Report |format=PDF |work=ROC Ministry of National Defense |url=http://report.mnd.gov.tw/eng/pdf/all-1-360.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2006|pages=89â90|quote=The PRC refusal to renounce using military power against Taiwan, its current emphasis on 'enhancing preparation for military struggle', its obvious intention of preparing a war against Taiwan reflected in operational deployment, readiness efforts, and annual military exercises in the Southeast China coastal region, and its progress in aerospace operations, information warfare, paralyzing warfare, and non-conventional warfare, all of these factors work together so that the ROC Armed Forces face an increasingly complicated and difficult situation in terms of self-defense and counterattack.

The PRC supports a version of the [[One-China policy]], which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China, and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence movement, the name "Taiwan" has been employed increasingly often on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/world/asia/12taiwan.html|title=Taiwan's Independence Movement Likely to Wane|last=Wong|first=Edward |date=12 March 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1928, the [[foreign policy]] of Republican China was complicated by a lack of internal unityâcompeting centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This situation changed after the defeat of the [[Beiyang Government|Peiyang Government]] by the Kuomintang, which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/china |title=Countries&amp;nbsp;â China|publisher=US Department of State, Office of the Historian|accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the KMT's retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the [[Western Bloc]], continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the PRC in the 1970s. [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|UN Resolution 2758]] (25 October 1971) recognized the [[People's Republic of China]] as China's sole representative in the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Propper.

The [[United States]] remains one of the [[Republic of China-United States relations|main allies]] of the country and, through the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing military training to the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="TRA-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/asiaandthepacific/bg1272.cfm|title=The Taiwan Relations Act After 20 Years: Keys to Past and Future Success|first=Stephen J.|last=Yates|author-link=Stephen J.

In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could suffer.&lt;ref name="SanctionsAFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=China: US spat over Taiwan could hit co-operation |date=2 February 2010 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDzKLVZ7X2dz8yrsshklcJZh38Cg |work=[[Google News]] |publisher=[[Google]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214100/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDzKLVZ7X2dz8yrsshklcJZh38Cg |archivedate=6 February 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position of the United States is that the PRC is expected to "use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan" and the ROC is to "exercise prudence in managing all aspects of [[Cross-Strait relations]]."

=== Participation in international events and organizations ===
{{See also|Foreign relations of Taiwan#Relation with International organizations}}

The ROC was a founding member of the United Nations, and held the [[China and the United Nations|seat of China]] on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/un-2001.htm |title=Taiwan and the United Nations |publisher=New Taiwan |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its limited international recognition, the Republic of China is a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], represented by a government-funded organization, the [[Taiwan Foundation for Democracy]] (TFD) under the name "Taiwan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/content/view/7908/146/ |title=Taiwan |publisher=UNPO |accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/english/about.php|title=About TFD|publisher=TFD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also due to its One China policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]], including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tkacik |first=John |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/05/13/2003443455 |title=JOHN TKACIK ON TAIWAN: Taiwan's 'undetermined' status|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the US and [[Japan]] publicly support the ROC's bid for membership in the [[World Health Organization]] as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Su |first=Joy |title=WHO application: a question of health or politics? |date=19 May 2004 |newspaper=Taipei Times |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/05/19/2003156094}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though the ROC sought to participate in the WHO since 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister Chiu leads our WHA delegation to actively hold bilateral talks with delegations from other nations.

Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced to use the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]" in international events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], where the PRC is also a party.&lt;ref name="chinese-taipei"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/07/25/167036/Taiwan-insists.htm |title=Taiwan insists on 'Chinese Taipei' |newspaper=China Post |date=25 July 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC is typically barred from using its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure; ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from bringing [[Flag of the Republic of China|ROC flags]] into venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Taiwan flags in Salt Lake ruffle a few feelings |date=10 February 2002 |newspaper=The Deseret News |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/894748/Taiwan-flags-in-SL-ruffle-a-few-feelings.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taiwan also participates in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (since 1991) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (since 2002) under the name "Chinese Taipei".
The ROC is able to participate as "China" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].

=== Opinions within Taiwan ===
{{See also|Taiwan independence|Chinese Unification}}
Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between those supporting unification, represented by the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of parties, and those supporting independence, represented by the [[Pan-Green Coalition]].

The KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public.&lt;ref name="ma-three-noes" /&gt; Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/05/16/156644/Unification-with.htm|title=Unification with China unlikely 'in our lifetimes': president-elect|last=Enav|first=Peter |date=16 May 2008|newspaper=China Post|accessdate=13 June 2009|quote='It is very difficult for us to see any unification talks even in our lifetimes,' Ma said. 'Taiwanese people would like to have economic interactions with the mainland, but obviously they donât believe their political system is suitable for Taiwan.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]], the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence, but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eckholm |first=Erik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/22/world/why-a-victory-in-taiwan-wasn-t-enough-for-some.html |title=Why a Victory in Taiwan Wasn't Enough for Some|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2000 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Taiwan Flashpoint: Independence debate |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/04/taiwan_flashpoint/html/independence_debate.stm |year=2009 |quote=Since neither outcome looks likely in the short or even medium term, it is perhaps not surprising that opinion polls suggest most Taiwanese people want things to stay as they are, with the island's ambiguous status unresolved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2008, Mexican newspaper ''[[El Sol de Mexico|El Sol de MÃ©xico]]'' asked President Ma about his views on the subject of "[[two Chinas]]" and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a [[Special non-state-to-state relations|special relationship]]. Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but he quoted the "[[1992 Consensus]]", currently accepted by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/oem/notas/n836891.htm|title=Impulsa Taiwan la reconciliaciÃ³n|date=2 September 2008|newspaper=El Sol de MÃ©xico|language=Spanish|accessdate=9 June 2009|quote=Esencialmente, no definirÃ­amos la relaciÃ³n a travÃ©s del estrecho de Taiwan como una relaciÃ³n de dos paÃ­ses o dos Chinas, porque nuestra ConstituciÃ³n no lo permite.

On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier [[William Lai]] said that he was a "political worker who advocates Taiwan independence", but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 11:59AM  |url=http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/china/taiwanese-premiers-independence-stance-incurs-beijings-wrath |title=Taiwanese premierâs independence stance incurs Beijingâs wrath |publisher=TODAYonline |date=28 September 2017 |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a common position shared by both the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan.

The government of the Republic of China was founded on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution of the ROC]] and its [[Three Principles of the People]], which states that the ROC "shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people."&lt;ref name="yb:government"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |chapter=Chapter 4: Government |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch04.pdf |pages=55â65 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091917/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |archivedate=12 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is divided into five branches (''Yuan''): the [[Executive Yuan]] (cabinet), the [[Legislative Yuan]] (Congress or Parliament), the [[Judicial Yuan]], the [[Control Yuan]] (audit agency), and the [[Examination Yuan]] (civil service examination agency). The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the [[Communist Party of China]]. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Tom|title=Judicial review in new democracies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=111|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-52039-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qJrsouEjOZEC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]
The [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies. Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], as a standing [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] and [[electoral college]], held some [[parliament]]ary functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible voters of the Republic via referendums.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt; Thus, there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Huang |first=Jei-hsuan |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/09/14/2003327608 |title=Letter: KMT holds the key|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=14 September 2006 |page=8 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jayasuriya|first=Kanishka|title=Law, capitalism and power in Asia|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OqGSrD9QhXcC&amp;pg=PA217|isbn=978-0-415-19743-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judicial Yuan is the highest [[judiciary|judicial]] organ. It interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries. The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen justices form the Council of Grand Justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China (2005) |at=Article 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are nominated and appointed by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[List of constitutional courts|constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[jury trial|trial by jury]] but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

[[File:Wu San-lien after election.jpg|thumb|[[Tangwai]] (Independent) Taiwanese-born politician [[Wu San-lien]] (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in [[Taipei|Taipei City]]'s first mayoral election in January 1951 with supporters.]]
[[Capital punishment]] is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050|title=Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions|last=Chang|first=Rich |date=2 January 2006|newspaper=Taipei Times|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of the executive. It can be considered a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the [[European Union]] or the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of [[civil servant]]s. It is based on the old [[imperial examination]] system used in dynastic China. It can be compared to the [[European Personnel Selection Office]] of the European Union or the [[Office of Personnel Management]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The tension between China and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards "Taiwan independence" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1285915.stm|title=Country profile: Taiwan|date=11 September 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC's official policy is to [[Chinese unification|reunify Taiwan and mainland China]] under the formula of "[[one country, two systems]]" and refuses to renounce the use of military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fapa.org/chinawp/chinathreatwp223.html|title=China's Threats, Editorial|date=23 February 2000|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as [[cross-Strait relations]]. It is the main political difference between two camps: the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]], composed of the pro-unification [[Kuomintang]], [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP), and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]], who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government of "China" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual [[Chinese unification|Chinese reunification]]. The opposition [[Pan-Green Coalition]] is composed of the pro-independence DPP and [[Taiwan Solidarity Union|Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)]].

=== Current political issues ===
[[File:2014 å¤ªé½è±å­¸é DSC00465 (13573978414).jpg|thumb|[[Sunflower Student Movement|Student protest]] in Taipei against a controversial [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement|trade agreement with China]] in March 2014]]
The dominant political issue in Taiwan is [[cross-Strait relations|its relationship with the PRC]]. For almost 60&amp;nbsp;years, there were no direct transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5346905.ece|title=Direct flights between China and Taiwan mark new era of improved relations|last=Yu|first=Sophie|author2=Jane Macartney |date=16 December 2008|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=4 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the United States authorized in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Michael S.

The politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader [[Shih Ming-teh]] which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== National identity ===
{{Main|Taiwanese identity|Chinese nationalism}}

Roughly 84% of Taiwan's population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.&lt;ref name="power-shift"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179â183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.&lt;ref name="panblue-reunif-chineseid" /&gt; The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

The [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.

Today, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as defence against the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] under the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]. This law gives green light to the use of military force when certain Chinese Red Lines formulated in the Anti-Secession Law are crossed like endangering citizens of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=2004NatDefRpt /&gt; From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the military was to "retake mainland China" through [[Project National Glory]]. As this mission has shifted to defence because the strength of [[People's Republic of China]] has massively increased, the ROC military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the [[Republic of China Air Force|air force]] and [[Republic of China Navy|navy]].
[[File:IDF Pre-production.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Air Force]] [[AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo|Indigenous Defense Fighter]]|alt=A light fighter aircraft on the ground surrounded by two men who are maintaining it.]]

Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government.&lt;ref name=towards&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fravel|first=M.

However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.{{sfn|Swaine|Mulvenon|2001|p=65|ps=: "[...]the ROC military functioned until very recently as an instrument of KMT rule [...] the bulk of the officer corps is still composed of Mainlanders, many of whom allegedly continue to support the values and outlook of more conservative KMT and New Party members. This is viewed as especially the case among the senior officers of the ROC Army. Hence, many DPP leaders insist that the first step to building a more secure Taiwan is to bring the military more fully under civilian control, to remove the dominant influence of conservative KMT elements, and to reduce what is regarded as an excessive emphasis on the maintenance of inappropriate ground force capabilities, as opposed to more appropriate air and naval capabilities."}}

The ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2004/P101.htm |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2004 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106230514/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2004/P101.htm |archivedate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=28601&amp;ctNode=3389|title=Women Take Command|last=Bishop|first=Mac William|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China|accessdate=5 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428091100/http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=28601&amp;ctNode=3389|archivedate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with nominal reserves totalling 3.6&amp;nbsp;million {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2005/p104.html |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2005 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127214132/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2005/p104.html |archivedate=27 January 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies or defence related industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/729500.stm |title=ASIA-PACIFIC &amp;#124; Military alternative in Taiwan |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2000 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly professional army over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/03/21/2003439010/wiki |title=The myth: a professional military in five years|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_347888.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313072548/http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_347888.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 March 2009 |title=Taiwan to end conscription |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription periods are planned to decrease from 14&amp;nbsp;months to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=124D9E23B9033ED0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Taiwan to shorten conscription term to one year |publisher=Central News Agency website, Taipei|date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last months of the Bush administration, Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending, at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.

According to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its "existing national boundaries".&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=A0000001|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Executive Yuan]] in 2012, Mongolia was re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution was announced in 1946.&lt;ref name="ExecutiveYuan_Mongolia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=101988&amp;ctNode=5650&amp;mp=1 |title=æéå¤èå¤æ¯å¦çºä¸­è¯æ°åé ååé¡èªªææ°èåèè³æ |publisher=Executive Yuan, Taiwan |location=Taipei |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1 special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its retreat, the ROC has controlled only [[Taiwan Province]] and some islands of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]. The ROC also controls the [[Pratas Islands]] and [[Taiping Island]] in the [[Spratly Islands]], which are part of the disputed [[South China Sea Islands]]. They were placed under [[Kaohsiung]] administration after the retreat to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=World: Asia-Pacific Analysis: Flashpoint Spratly |date=14 February 1999 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/279170.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. [[Taipei]] became a special municipality in 1967 and [[Kaohsiung]] in 1979. The two provincial governments were "streamlined", with their functions transferred to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | work=Taiwan Review | title=Gone with the Times | date=1 October 1999 | accessdate=13 April 2012 | last=Hwang | first=Jim | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226030251/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | archivedate=26 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[New Taipei]], [[Taichung]] and [[Tainan]] were upgraded to [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]].

According to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million.  This provision does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to Taipei County (now [[New Taipei City]]) and Taoyuan County (now [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] City).

The quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the "[[Taiwan Miracle]]". Taiwan is one of the "[[Four Asian Tigers]]" alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]].

Japanese rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.

By 1945, [[hyperinflation]] was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.

When the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&amp;nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&amp;nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of [[gold]] and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=9442|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=çéç¾© |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949å¹´éå°é»é ä¸­è¯æ°åä¿å½æ¬ |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =76, 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of [[import substitution industrialization|import-substitution]], attempting to produce imported goods domestically.

In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted in fully stabilized prices by 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makinen|Woodward|1989}}: "It was the fiscal regime change on Taiwan, as in the European episodes, that finally brought price stability. It was the aid program that brought the budget to near balance, and when the aid program reached its full proportions in 1952, prices stabilized."&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development was encouraged by American economic aid and programs such as the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]], which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth, 3.6%.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Clough, "Taiwan under Nationalist Rule, 1949â1982," in Roderick MacFarquar et al., ed., ''Cambridge History of China'', Vol 15, The People's Republic Pt 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 837&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On a [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries. Taiwan's HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN's new "Inequality-adjusted HDI" calculation method.

In 1974, Chiang Ching-kuo implemented the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]], the beginning foundations that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers [[Acer Inc.]] and [[Asus]], mobile phone maker [[HTC]], as well as electronics manufacturing giant [[Foxconn]], which makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. [[Computex Taipei]] is a major computer expo, held since 1981.

Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist, export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being [[Privatization|privatized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1153&amp;CtNode=128|title=Privatization Set in Motion|last=Her|first=Kelly|date=12 January 2005|newspaper=Taiwan Review|accessdate=5 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430041754/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1153&amp;CtNode=128|archivedate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real growth in [[gross domestic product|GDP]] has averaged about 8% during the past three decades.

The cross-strait investments now exceed US$ 100 billions. Four Taiwanese-owned firms rank among China's top 10 biggest exporters. 10% of the Taiwanese labor force now works in China."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy. A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that "Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive 'Sinicization' of Taiwanese economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DoIT|2008|p=5}} "Although used-to-be-hostile tension between Taiwan and China has been eased to a certain degree, Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive "Sinicization" of Taiwanese economy. Strategies to avoid excessive "Sinicization" of the Taiwanese economy could include efforts to increase geographic diversity of overseas Taiwanese employment, diversifying Taiwan's export markets and investment. "&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very costly, and therefore less probable.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China's own economy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan's total trade in 2010 reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wang |first=Audrey  |url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=142731&amp;ctNode=453&amp;mp=9|title=Taiwan's 2010 trade hits record high|newspaper=Taiwan Today|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-technology industrial parks have sprung up in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in the PRC, [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]]. It is estimated that some 50,000&amp;nbsp;Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;businesspeople and their dependents are established in the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morris |first=Peter |title=Taiwan business in China supports opposition |date=4 February 2004 |newspaper=Asia Times Online |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB04Ad04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its conservative financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many of its neighbours from the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into [[recession]] in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002â2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5411/is_199801/ai_n21432097/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608110113/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5411/is_199801/ai_n21432097/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2009 |title=Coping with Asian financial crisis: The Taiwan experience &amp;#124; Seoul Journal of Economics |publisher=Find Articles at BNET |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROC often joins international organizations (especially ones that also include the People's Republic of China) under a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu ([[Chinese Taipei]]) since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/countries_e/chinese_taipei_e.htm|title=Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) and the WTO|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Republic of China)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications]] of the Republic of China is the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan. Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services are provided by [[Taiwan Railway Administration]] (TRA) and [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the [[Taipei Metro]], [[Taoyuan Metro]] (incl. the [[Airport MRT]]) and [[Kaohsiung MRT]], while [[Taichung Metro]] is under construction. Major airports include [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taiwan Taoyuan]], [[Kaohsiung International Airport|Kaohsiung]], [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Taipei Songshan]] and [[Taichung Airport|Taichung]]. There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being [[China Airlines]] and [[EVA Air]].

The higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial period. However, after the Republic of China [[Retrocession Day|took over]] Taiwan from Japan in 1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Postiglione|first=Gerard A.|author2=Grace C.

The Taiwanese education system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan's [[Taiwan Miracle|economic development]] while creating one of the worldâs most highly educated workforces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_M_Chap1.pdf |title=TIMSS Math 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://isc.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_S_Chap1.pdf| title= TIMSS Science 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the highest in Asia.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/education-in-taiwan-taiwans-colleges-and-universities/ |title=Education in Taiwan: Taiwanâs Colleges and Universities |last=Chou |first=Chuing |publication-date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25â64 hold a bachelor's degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/university-degrees-mindset-shift-needed |title=University degrees: Mindset shift needed |last=Lee |first=Pearl |publisher=The Straits Times |publication-date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Taiwanâs universities have also been under criticism for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwanâs 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2016/08/taiwans-higher-education-enrolment-starts-downward-slide/ |title=Taiwanâs higher education enrolment starts a downward slide |date=16 August 2016 |website=ICEF Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese government has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24156168 |title=The draw of blue collar jobs in Taiwan |last=Sui |first=Cindy |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Many Taiwanese students attend cram schools, or [[bushiban]], to improve skills and knowledge on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science, history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects. Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and recitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200509/2005090201.html |title=Over 70% of Taiwanese parents send kids to English bushibans |publisher=Invest in Taiwan, Department of Investment Services |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050510/http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200509/2005090201.html |archivedate = 8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.

The ROC government reports that over 95% of the population is [[Han Taiwanese|Han Chinese]], of which the majority includes descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of Taiwan may be roughly divided among the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] (70%), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (14%), the [[Waishengren]] (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt;

The [[Hoklo people]] are the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated from the coastal southern [[Fujian]] region across the [[Taiwan Strait]] starting in the 17th century. The [[Hakka people|Hakka]] comprise about 15% of the total population, and descend from Han migrants to [[Guangdong]], its surrounding areas and Taiwan. Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt;

The indigenous [[Taiwanese aborigines]] number about 533,600 and are divided into 16 recognized groups.{{sfnp|Exec.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Taiwan}}

[[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official national language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese rule. As in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Traditional Chinese]] is used as the writing system in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="yb-languages"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2011 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |chapter=Chapter 2: People and Language |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch02D.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514004814/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch02D.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 70% of the population belonging to the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] ethnic group speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] (a variant of the [[Min Nan]] speech of [[Fujian]] province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population) use [[Hakka Chinese]]. Most ''[[Mainland Chinese|waishengren]]'' speak primarily Mandarin. Although Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television and radio, non-Mandarin [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have undergone a revival in public life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="yb-languages" /&gt;

Taiwan's indigenous languages, the [[Formosan languages]], do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Their use among Taiwan's aboriginal minority groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen.&lt;ref name="yb-languages" /&gt; Of the 14 extant languages, five are considered [[moribund language|moribund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic Analysis and Language Processing |author1=Zeitoun, Elizabeth |author2=Yu, Ching-Hua |journal=Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=168 |url=http://aclclp.org.tw/clclp/v10n2/v10n2a2.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health care]] in Taiwan is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bureau of National Health Insurance |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Taiwan BNHI |url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?menu=11&amp;menu_id=295&amp;webdata_id=1865 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823191235/http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?menu=11&amp;menu_id=295&amp;webdata_id=1865 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2007 |title=Bureau of National Health Insurance-National Health Insurance Act |publisher=Bureau of National Health Insurance, ROC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BNHI insurance coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced for disabled or certain elderly people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to a recently published survey, out of 3,360&amp;nbsp;patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital, 75.1% of the patients said they are "very satisfied" with the hospital service; 20.5% said they are "okay" with the service.

After their move to Taiwan, the [[Kuomintang]] imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan. The government launched a [[History of the Kuomintang cultural policy|program]] promoting [[Chinese calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]], and [[Chinese opera]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The status of Taiwanese culture is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yip|2004|pp=230â248}}; {{harvnb|Makeham|2005|pp=2â8}}; {{harvnb|Chang|2005|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the [[political status of Taiwan]], politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and [[China|Chinese]] dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125â129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23â41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].

The collection, estimated to be one-tenth of China's cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The classical music culture in Taiwan is highly developed and features artists such as violinist [[Cho-Liang Lin]], pianist [[Ching-Yun Hu]], and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist Director [[Wu Han (pianist)|Wu Han]]. [[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.

Taiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&amp;vol_num=11&amp;topics_id=558 |format=&amp;nbsp;â &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&amp;as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&amp;vol_num=11&amp;topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide a service for mailing packages.

Taiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures. [[Bubble tea]] and milk tea are available in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. [[List of Taiwanese television series|Taiwanese television shows]] are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese films]] have won various international awards at film festivals around the world. [[Ang Lee]], a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such as: ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''; ''[[Eat Drink Man Woman]]''; ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''; ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''; ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]''; and ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. Other famous Taiwanese directors include [[Tsai Ming-liang]], [[Edward Yang]], and [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]].

[[Baseball]] is Taiwan's [[national sport]] and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are [[Chien-Ming Wang]] and [[Wei-Yin Chen]]; both are pitchers in [[Major League Baseball]]. Other notable players playing in the United States include [[Chin-hui Tsao]] who played for the [[Colorado Rockies]] (2003â2005) and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2007, 2015â2016), [[Hong-Chih Kuo]], [[Fu-Te Ni]], and [[Chin-lung Hu]]. The [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]] in Taiwan was established in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316075320/http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp|url=http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp|archivedate=16 March 2009 |title=Intro of CPBL |publisher=Cpbl.com.tw |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually absorbed the competing [[Taiwan Major League]] in 2003. {{As of|2015}}, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance over 5,000 per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbsc.org/news/pro-baseball-leagues-open-2016-seasons-worldwide-approx-150-million-fans-expected/|title=Pro Baseball Leagues open 2016 seasons worldwide â approx. 150 million fans expected|publisher=WBSC|date=17 April 2016|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides baseball, [[basketball]] is Taiwan's other major sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Audrey | last = Wang | title = A Passion for Hoops | date = 1 June 2008 | publisher = Taiwan Review | url = http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=43967&amp;CtNode=128 | work = The Taiwan Review | accessdate = 8 April 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120215062917/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=43967&amp;CtNode=128 | archivedate = 15 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years. In the 2004 Olympics, [[Chen Shih-hsin]] and [[Chu Mu-yen]] won the first two gold medals in women's flyweight event and men's flyweight event, respectively. Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as [[Yang Shu-chun]] have strengthened Taiwan's taekwondo culture.

Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations and events under the name of "[[Chinese Taipei]]" due to [[political status of Taiwan|its political status]]. In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The [[World Games 2009]] were held in [[Kaohsiung]] between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei hosted the [[21st Summer Deaflympics]] in September of the same year. Furthermore, Taipei hosted the Summer [[Universiade]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Christie | last = Chen | title = UNIVERSIADE: Foreign athletes praise Taipei's efforts as host city | date = 30 August 2017 |work=Focus Taiwan | url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aftr/201708300026.aspx | accessdate = 25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan is also a major Asian country for [[Korfball]]. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball Championship and took the silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Netherlands Retains World Youth Korfball Champion; Taiwan is on the Way to the World.. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/08/idUS82890+08-Nov-2008+BW20081108 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203071126/https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/08/idUS82890%2B08-Nov-2008%2BBW20081108 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2011 |agency=Reuters Newswire |date=8 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Taiwan's korfball team won a bronze medal at the World Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hazeldine|first=Richard|title=Jujitsu, korfball put Taiwan back on winning track|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2009/07/22/2003449286|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yani Tseng]] is the most famous Taiwanese [[professional golfer]] currently playing on the US-based [[LPGA Tour]].

=== Calendar ===
{{Main|Minguo calendar}}
{{See also|Chinese calendar|Public holidays in Taiwan}}

[[File:ROC calendar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A calendar that commemorates the first year of the Republic as well as the election of [[Sun Yat-sen]] as the provisional President|alt=A calendar with a picture of a Chinese man in the centre. On top of it stands a flag with five horizontal stripes (red, yellow, blue, white, and black).]]
Taiwan uses two official calendars: the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Minguo calendar]]. The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the "96th year of the Republic" (æ°å96å¹´),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lotta Danielsson-Murphy |url=http://www.us-taiwan.org/taiwan_holidays.html |title=Taiwan Calendar and Holidays |publisher=US-Taiwan Business Council |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its months and days were numbered according to the Gregorian calendar.

Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written 2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an expiration date 11&amp;nbsp;years earlier than intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/25/2003294523 |title=Taiwan may drop idiosyncratic Republican calendar|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan also uses the [[Chinese calendar|lunar calendar]] for traditional festivals such as the [[Chinese New Year]], the [[Lantern Festival]], and the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |title=Holidays and Festivals in Taiwan |publisher=Government Information Office, ROC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009021955/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |archivedate=9 October 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berber land.png|thumb|Tamazgha]]
{{Portal|Berbers}} 
'''Tamazgha''' ({{lang-ber|TamazÉ£a}}, [[Tifinagh]]: âµâ´°âµâ´°âµ£âµâ´° or âµâ´°âµâ´°âµ£âµâ´°) is a [[Berber language]] [[toponym]] denoting the '''[[Greater Maghreb]]''', the lands traditionally inhabited by [[Berbers]] (Mazice/Amazigh). The region encompasses the geographical area between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Niger River]], a large swathe of territory spanning [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hurst Hannum, Eileen Babbitt (eds.)|title=Negotiating Self-determination|date=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739114336|page=135|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=gf78chlTvU4C&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Berber linguistic root ''MZÆ'' or ''ZÆ'' is ancient, ''TamazÉ£a'' as a toponym is derived from the Berber language, coined in the context of [[Berber nationalism]]. It appeared for the first time in Algeria and Morocco in the 1970s. It is not clear at all who coined it. Some{{who|date=June 2017}} say it was [[Mouloud Mammeri]] (1917â1989). According to others{{who|date=June 2017}}, it was [[Kateb Yacine]] (1929â1989).

The most inhabited areas of the Tamazgha are the coastal fertile regions of northern [[Libya]], northern and eastern Tunisia, northern Algeria, northern Morocco, and the Atlantic coast of Morocco. "Tamazgha" corresponds roughly to [[Herodotus]]' [[Ancient Libya]] and to the medieval [[Barbary Coast]].

The term is used by the [[Berbers]] because there was not originally a common word that refers to all the geographical territory inhabited by the Mazices, since the Mazice people live in several countries, and they are not united politically, with many scattered around the World by the Mazice Diaspora. So, the name has been created to define an Mazice Nation, and unify the people of the Tamazgha, or the [[Great Maghreb]] with their original culture. Many philologists sort this term like neologism, built from traditional [[Berber languages|Berber]] (Tamazight) terms.

The term has been translated into Spanish as [[Mazigia]], abbreviated as MZG and used as an alternative international license plate code for some people [http://atlasgeo.span.ch/fotw/flags/es%7Dic.html].

The '''United Nations Environment Programme''' (UNEP), an agency of the [[United Nations]], coordinates the organization's environmental activities and assists developing countries in implementing [[environmental peacebuilding|environmentally sound policies and practices]]. It was founded by [[Maurice Strong]], its first director, as a result of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm Conference) in June 1972 and has overall responsibility for environmental problems among United Nations agencies; however, international talks on specialized issues, such as addressing climate change or combating desertification, are overseen by other UN organizations, like the Bonn-based Secretariat of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]. UNEP's activities cover a wide range of issues regarding the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], marine and terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, environmental governance and green economy. It has played a significant role in developing international environmental conventions, promoting [[environmental science]] and information and illustrating the way those can be implemented in conjunction with policy, working on the development and implementation of policy with national governments, regional institutions in conjunction with environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). UNEP has also been active in funding and implementing environment related development projects.

UNEP frequently uses the alternative name UN Environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unenvironment.org/about-un-environment&lt;/ref&gt; 

UN Environment has aided in the formulation of guidelines and treaties on issues such as the international trade in potentially harmful chemicals, transboundary [[air pollution]], and contamination of international waterways. Relevant documents, including scientific papers, are available via the UNEP Document Repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wedocs.unep.org/ |title= Home |website=UNEP Document Repository|date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] and UN Environment established the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in 1988. UN Environment is also one of several Implementing Agencies for the [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF) and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the [[Montreal Protocol]], and it is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://undg.org/about/undg-global/undg/ |website=United Nations Development Group |title=About Â» UNDG at the Global Level Â» UNDG|date=2017|author= |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Cyanide Management Code]], a programme of best practice for the chemical's use at gold mining operations, was developed under UN Environment's [[aegis]].

==History==
UNEP headquarters was established in Nairobi, Kenya, on 5 June 1972 as an outcome from the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) with a staff of 300, including 100 professionals in a variety of fields, and with a fiveâyear fund of more than US$100 million. At the time, US$40 million were pledged by the United States and the remainder by 50 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwinn Hill (October 20, 1975), [https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/20/archives/un-environment-effort-a-start-a-long-way-to-go-un.html U.N. Environment Effort: A Start, a Long Way to Go] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
===Executive Director===
UNEP's current acting Executive Director [[Joyce Msuya]] took office in November 2018, following the resignation of [[Erik Solheim]]. Prior to that appointment, she was UNEP's Deputy Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tanzanian appointed to head U.N. Environment Programme |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/11/21/tanzanian-appointed-to-head-united-nations-environment-programme/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=AfricaNews |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 1972, the UN General Assembly unanimously elected [[Maurice Strong]] to be the first head of UN Environment. Also Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Earth Summit, Strong has played a critical role is globalizing the environmental movement.

The position was then held for 17 years (1975â1992) by Dr. [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba]], who was instrumental in bringing environmental considerations to the forefront of global thinking and action. Under his leadership, UN Environment's most widely acclaimed successâthe historic 1987 agreement to protect the ozone layerâthe [[Montreal Protocol]] was negotiated. He was succeeded by [[Elizabeth Dowdeswell]] (1992â1998), [[Klaus TÃ¶pfer]] (1998â2006), [[Achim Steiner]] (2006â2016), and [[Erik Solheim]] (2016â2018).

** including the [[Territorial Approach to Climate Change]] (TACC)
* disasters and conflicts
* [[ecosystem management]]
* [[environmental governance]]
* environment under review

===Notable achievements===
UNEP has registered several successes, such as the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] for limiting emissions of gases blamed for thinning the planet's protective ozone layer, and the 2012 [[Minamata Convention on Mercury|Minamata Convention]], a treaty to limit toxic mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Alister Doyle (February 17, 2013 ), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-test-idUSBRE91G03Q20130217 Reformed U.N. formula for making planet greener to get first test] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNEP has sponsored the development of solar loan programmes, with attractive return rates, to buffer the initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase solar PV systems. The most famous example is the [[Indian Solar Loan Programme|solar loan programme]] sponsored by UN Environment helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=504&amp;ArticleID=5562&amp;l=en Solar loan programme in India]&lt;/ref&gt; Success in India's solar programme has led to similar projects in other parts of the developing world, including [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Mexico]].

UNEP sponsors the Marshlands project in the [[Middle East]]. In 2001, UN Environment alerted the international community to the destruction of the Marshlands when it released satellite images showing that 90 percent of the Marshlands had already been lost. The UN Environment "support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshland" commenced in August 2004, in order to manage the Marshland area in an environmentally sound manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshlands.unep.or.jp/ UN Environment Marshland project in Middle East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006021403/http://marshlands.unep.or.jp/ |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure full participation of global communities, UN Environment works in an inclusive fashion that brings on board different societal cohorts. UN Environment has a programme for young people known as Tunza. Within this programme are other projects like the [[AEO for Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/DEWA/africa/youth/about.htm AEO-for-Youth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223100118/http://www.unep.org/DEWA/africa/youth/about.htm |date=23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glaciers shrinking'''

{{further|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}}
[[Glacier]]s are shrinking at record rates and many could disappear within decades, the U.N. Environment Programme said on 16 March 2008. The scientists measuring the health of almost 30 glaciers around the world found that ice loss reached record levels in 2006. On average, the glaciers shrank by 4.9 feet in 2006, the most recent year for which data are available. The most severe loss was recorded at [[Norway]]'s Breidalblikkbrea glacier, which shrank 10.2 feet in 2006. Glaciers lost an average of about a foot of ice a year between 1980 and 1999. But since the turn of the millennium the average loss has increased to about 20&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/03/16/un.climate.ap/index.html U.N.: Glaciers shrinking at record rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric vehicles'''

At the fifth Magdeburg Environmental Forum held from 3â4 July 2008, in Magdeburg, Germany, UN Environment and car manufacturer [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] called for the establishment of infrastructure for [[electric vehicle]]s. At this international conference, 250 high-ranking representatives from the world of politics and non-government organizations discussed solutions for future road transportation under the motto of "Sustainable Mobilityâ[[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|the Post-2012 CO2 Agenda]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/ |title=UNEP and Daimler Call for Infrastructure for Electric and Fuel-cell Vehicles |author= |date=4 July 2008 |work= |publisher=Climate-L.org |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091213000040/http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/ |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports===
UNEP publishes many reports, atlases and newsletters. For instance, the fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) assessment is a comprehensive report on environment, development and human well-being, providing analysis and information for policy makers and the concerned public. One of many points in the GEO-5 warns that we are living far beyond our means. It notes that the human population is now so large that the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available.

In June 2010, a report from UN Environment declared that a global shift towards a [[veganism|vegan diet]] was needed to save the world from hunger, fuel shortages and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Carus [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 June 2010

===International years===
* 2007 â [[Year of the Dolphin|(International) Year of the Dolphin]]
(International) Patron of the Year of the Dolphin was H.S.H.

Following the publication of [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in February 2007, the "Paris Call for Action" &amp;mdash; read out by French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and supported by 46 countries &amp;mdash;  called for the United Nations Environment Programme to be replaced by a new and more powerful "United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO)", to be modelled on the [[World Health Organization]]. The 46 countries included the European Union nations, but notably did not include the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, the top four emitters of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=environment&amp;storyID=2007-02-03T144510Z_01_L03357553_RTRIDST_0_DCBRIGHTS-GLOBALWARMING-APPEAL-DC.XML|title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle|df=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States Navy operations during World War I'''  began on April 6, 1917, after the formal [[American entry into World War I|declaration of war]] on the [[German Empire]]. The [[United States|American]] navy focused on countering enemy [[U-boat]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while convoying men and supplies to [[France]] and [[Italy]]. Because of United States' late entry into the war, her [[capital ship]]s never engaged the German fleet, and few decisive submarine actions occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 861â865.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
=== Atlantic Ocean ===
The main theater of [[World War I]] was the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In order to relieve the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Europe]]an allies already on the battle front, the United States Navy was tasked with transporting millions of American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic to France. The [[United States Navy]] was ill-prepared for war, and the only solution was to begin deploying whatever was available on convoy duty and arming merchantmen with small [[naval gun]]s manned by [[United States Navy Armed Guard|armed guard]] detachments.

Congress declared war on April 6, 1917, which meant the [[United States Coast Guard]] automatically became a part of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].{{#tag:ref|Under the January 28, 1915 act creating the Coast Guard from the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] the Coast Guard comes under orders of the Secretary of the Navy when Congress declares war or when the President directs such an action to be taken. (U.S. Congress, "Act to Create the Coast Guard", ''Congressional Record'', 63rd Congress, 3rd session, 1915, volume 2, part 2.)&lt;ref name=Larzelere7-8&gt;Larzelere, pp 7â8&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} [[Destroyer]]s and similar escort warships were considered the most effective means of sinking enemy submarines and protecting merchantmen. Therefore, destroyer squadrons were based in the [[British Isles]] at major ports including [[Cobh|Queenston]], [[Ireland]]. The capital ships took up positions with the British [[Royal Navy]] in the [[North Sea]] for an uneventful [[Blockade of Germany|blockade]] of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] that would last even after the armistice into 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 863â865.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Action of 15 October 1917|victory]] for the United States Navy took place in the Atlantic on October 15, 1917. The destroyer {{USS|Cassin|DD-43|6}}, commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] W. N. Vernon, encountered [[SM U-61|''U-61'']] off [[Mine Head]], Ireland. After chasing the U-boat for an hour, U-61 turned around and fired a single [[torpedo]], which struck ''Cassin'' on port the side. [[Gunner's Mate]] [[Petty Officer First Class|First Class]] [[Osmond Ingram]] noticed the torpedo just before it struck and alarmed the [[K-gun]] crew, who began firing [[depth charge]]s. ''Cassin'' was heavily damaged, but her crew kept her afloat and continued firing. Ingram was killed and later was to receive the [[Medal of Honor]], while nine others were wounded. ''Cassin'' struck ''U-61''{{'}}s conning tower, which forced her crew to disengage and retreat.&lt;ref name=NHHCcassin&gt;"Cassin", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:U-58 captured 1917.jpg|left|thumb|German officers and crewmen evacuating the [[SM U-58|''U-58'']] on November 17, 1917.]]

On November 17, 1917, two destroyers became the first U.S. Navy ships to sink an enemy submarine. {{USS|Fanning|DD-37|6}} and {{USS|Nicholson|DD-52|6}} were escorting convoy OQ-20 eastbound, when a lookout sighted the periscope of [[SM U-58|''U-58'']]. The U-boat was forced to surface by depth charges and was subsequently defeated in a brief surface engagement. At least one shot from ''Nicholson'' struck the u-boat, killing two men and causing heavy damage. The thirty-nine survivors abandoned the sinking ''U-58'' and were taken prisoner. [[Lieutenant]]s [[Frank Berrien]] and [[Arthur S. Carpender]] both received the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E7D71E3AE433A25753C3A9649D946696D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=TELLS WHOLE STORY OF SINKING U-BOAT; Destroyers Fanning and Nicholson Dropped Depth Charges, Bringing Submarine to Surface SANK IN A FEW MINUTES Four Officers and 35 sailors Surrender and Receive Chivalrous Treatment--British Praise.

Four United States Navy ships were lost during World War I, only two by enemy action, though six merchant ships with armed guards aboard were also destroyed. The first combat loss was {{USS|Jacob Jones|DD-61|6}}, a destroyer, which was sailing to Ireland in a zig-zag pattern with five other warships from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. On December 17, ''KapitÃ¤nleutnant'' [[Hans Rose]] of [[SM U-53|''U-53'']] sighted the destroyer and attacked with a spread of torpedoes. One was spotted by the Americans, but despite taking evasive action, she was fatally damaged. [[Commander]] [[David W. Bagley]] ordered his crew to abandon ship, and as she sank the armed depth charges aboard began to detonate, adding to the already heavy casualties. Sixty-six of her crew were killed, and more injured; only thirty-eight survived. ''Jacob Jones'' was the first American destroyer ever lost in battle, and she went down within eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Feuer, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHHCjacobjones&gt;"Jacob Jones", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest loss of life for the U.S. Navy during the war was on the [[collier (ship type)|collier]] [[USS Cyclops (AC-4)|USS ''Cyclops'']] in March 1918. She left [[Barbados]] on 4 March 1918 bound for [[Baltimore, Maryland]], but was never seen again. She may have been sunk by a German submarine, but it is more likely that she capsized because of the shifting of her cargo of coal. ''Cyclops'' was lost with 236 crewmen and passengers.

Three [[United States Army]] and navy transports, [[USS Henry R. Mallory (ID-1280)|USAT ''Henry R. Mallory'']], [[USS Tenadores (1913)|USAT ''Tenadores'']] and {{USS|Mercury|ID-3012|6}}, received credit for [[Action of 4 April 1918|defeating a U-boat on April 4, 1918]]. Sailing back to the United States from France, a U-boat surfaced at 11:45 and fired her torpedoes at the ''Mallory''. Lookouts spotted the tracks, and the ship was able to evade the torpedo. The submarine was then spotted, and all three ships opened fire with their main guns, hitting the u-boat as it submerged. The Americans began dropping depth charges, but the unknown u-boat was not seen again.&lt;ref&gt;Gleaves, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Christabel star.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Christabel|SP-162|6}}{{'}}s white star, the symbol for a U-boat kill.]]

The [[auxiliary cruiser|auxiliary]] [[yacht]] {{USS|Christabel|SP-162|6}} [[Action of 21 May 1918|engaged on May 21]] the [[SM UC-56|''UC-56'']] twice off the coast of [[Spain]] while escorting a British merchantman.&lt;ref name=NHHCchristabel&gt;"Christabel", DANFS, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;
That afternoon an oil slick was spotted by ''Christabel''{{'}}s crew and later was spotted the wake of the submarine. Depth charges were dropped, but the submarine escaped, and returned to harass the convoy that night. At about 11:00pm lookouts on ''Cristabel'' sighted a periscope and immediately maneuvered to fire depth charges. Several successive hits damaged the U-boat, but it escaped and had to cruise on the surface to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] to prevent its sinking. The crew of ''UC-56'' were interned by Spain, but the U-boat was scuttled rather than be handed over. During the action, a few depth charges became loose aboard ''Christabel'', and at great personal risk [[Ensign]] [[Daniel Augustus Joseph Sullivan]] secured them, earning him the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name=NHHCsullivan&gt;Lieutenant Commander Daniel A.J. Sullivan, USNRF, (1884â1941)", Online Library â People, U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June the British [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Dwinsk||6}} was [[Action of 18 June 1918|attacked]] by [[SM U-151|''U-151'']] about 400 miles east of the [[Bermudas]]. Twenty-two crewmen were lost, but the rest survived in the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]]. The U-boat remained in the area to use the lifeboats as bait for Allied ships. A few hours, later the auxiliary cruiser [[SS Kronprinz Wilhelm|USS ''Von Steuben'']] arrived and found the lifeboats. But before she reached, them a torpedo was spotted. Two guns opened fire, one on the incoming torpedo and the other on ''U-151''{{'}}s periscope. The cruiser also began evasive maneuvers and the torpedo missed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/v/von-steuben-i.html |title= Von Steuben I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SM U-156|''U-156'']], under Richard Feldt, [[Attack on Orleans|raided]] the port of [[Orleans, Massachusetts]], on the morning of July 18. Feldt surfaced in the dark and positioned his boat off [[Nauset Beach]]. He then began shelling the civilian [[tugboat]] {{SS|Perth Amboy||6}} and four wooden [[barge]]s with his deck gun. All five targets were destroyed. A few shells missed and struck shore, becoming the first enemy shells on the continental United States since the 1846 [[Siege of Fort Texas]] at the beginning of the [[MexicanâAmerican War|Mexican War]]. Nine Coast Guard [[Curtiss HS]] [[seaplane]]s spotted the U-boat and dropped bombs on her, but all failed to detonate.&lt;ref name=Larzelere135&gt;Larzelere, p 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, [[USS California (ACR-6)|USS ''San Diego'']] suffered an explosion while sailing from the [[Portsmouth Naval Yard]] to [[New York City]]. The [[armored cruiser]] was northeast of [[Fire Island]] when it is thought torpedo struck her port side below the waterline at the engine room below. The damage prevented a water tight hatch from sealing and the engine room and fire room No. 9 both flooded in minutes. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Harley H. Christy]] was convinced he was under a U-boat attack and ordered his men to battle stations. They began firing at anything that even vaguely resembled a periscope. When it was clear the ship could not be saved, Captain Christy gave the order to abandon ship. Twenty-eight minutes after the explosion, ''San Diego'' slipped under the waves, taking six crewmen with her. There was later some controversy over the sinking, as no U-boat was reported in the area. Eventually, the sinking was blamed on a [[sea mine]] possibly laid by ''U-156''. USS ''San Diego'' was the only U.S. Navy capital ship lost in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/california-ii.html |title= California II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Mount Vernon torpedoed.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie|USS '' Mount Vernon'']] on September 5 after being torpedoed.]]
The only [[lightvessel]] of the lost in combat was [[Diamond Shoal Lightship No. 71 (LV-71)|Diamond Shoal Lightship No. 71]]. On August 6, she was patrolling off North Carolina's [[Diamond Shoals]] when she encounter a sinking [[cargo ship]], {{SS|Merak||6}}, a victim of [[SM U-140|''U-140'']]. The survivors were rescued, and ''LV-71''{{'}}s captain, Master Walter Barnett, sent out a warning to friendly that a U-boat was in the area. "U-140" intercepted the message and returned. Upon arrival, she surfaced and Commander [[Waldemar Kophamel]] demanded the Americans abandon the lightship. As ''LV-71'' was unarmed, her crew had no choice but to row ashore in their boat, while the U-boat destroyed ship with its deck gun. There were no casualties on either side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131030004612/http://www.outer-banks.com/hatteraskeepers/lightship.asp |archivedate= 2013-10-30 |url= http://www.outer-banks.com/hatteraskeepers/lightship.asp |title= Diamond Shoals Lightships |website= North Carolina's Outer Banks }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?22426 |title= SS Merak (+1918) |website= Wrecksite.eu |accessdate= 19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messimer, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie|USS '' Mount Vernon'']] was a German-owned ocean liner that was seized and armed by the United States Navy. On the morning of September 5, 1918, ''Mount Vernon'' was off the coast of France accompanied by four destroyers, when the periscope of [[SM U-82|''U-82'']] was sighted. The auxiliary cruiser immediately [[Action of 5 September 1918|opened fire]] with her main guns, damaging the submarine. However, ''U-82'' managed to fire a torpedo. ''Mount Vernon'' tried to dodge the torpedo, but was unsuccessful. Thirty-six sailors were killed and thirteen wounded, but the ship was saved. {{USS|Winslow|DD-53|6}}, {{USS|Conner|DD-72|6}}, {{USS|Wainwright|DD-62|6}} and USS ''Nicholson'' all dropped depth charges, but the U-boat got safely away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/m/mount-vernon-iii.html |title= Mount Vernon III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Sea ===
With the encouragement of [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/policy-and-ideasroosevelt-historyfdr/early-political-career|title=Early Political Career|publisher=Roosevelt Institute|accessdate=2012-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115082124/http://rooseveltinstitute.org/policy-and-ideasroosevelt-historyfdr/early-political-career|archive-date=2015-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States manufactured 100,000 [[naval mine]]s for the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to prevent U-boats from reaching Atlantic shipping lanes.  The United States North Sea Mine Force commanded by Rear Admiral [[Joseph Strauss (admiral)|Joseph Strauss]] aboard the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force flagship USS {{USS|Black Hawk|AD-9|2}} laid the new type of mine in deeper water than had ever before been mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/nsminebr.htm|title=The North Sea Mine Barrage|publisher=The Great War Society|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rear Admiral]] [[Lewis Clinton-Baker]], commanding the Royal Navy minelaying force at the time, described the barrage as the "biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history."  The official statistics on lost German submarines compiled on 1 March 1919 credited the North Sea mine barrage with the certain destruction of four U-boats, probable destruction of two more, and possible destruction of another two.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, Reginald Rowan ''The Yankee mining squadron; or, Laying the North Sea mining barrage'' (1920) United States Naval Institute pp.5,15,18-22,27-36,43-47,56,82-83,101&amp;108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediterranean Sea ===
American naval operations in the Mediterranean took the form of escorting convoys and delivering supplies. The Mediterranean was not without enemies, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces in northern Italy and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were two major threats though by 1917 their navies were mostly defeated or blockaded by ships of the [[Otranto Barrage]]. Other than the land [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], the Americans engaged in only two memorable battles in the Mediterranean theater.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was when {{USS|Lydonia|SP-700|6}} together with {{HMS|Basilisk|1910|6}} [[Action of 8 May 1918|sank]] a U-boat off [[Algiers]] on May 8, 1918. ''Lydonia'' and ''Basilisk'' were steaming with a convoy from [[Bizerte]] to [[Gibraltar]] when they came across the German submarine {{SMU|UB-70||2}}. A coordinated depth charge attack ensued but the Germans were able to torpedo the British merchant ship {{SS|Ingleside||6}}, which sank. After a fifteen-minute running battle, the depth charging was stopped and survivors of the ''Ingleside'' were rescued. Heavy seas prevented an immediate assessment of possible damage to the submarine but later evaluations credited USS ''Lydonia'' and HMS ''Basilisk'' with sinking ''UB-70'' when she failed to show up at any port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/l/lydonia.html |title= Lydonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Britannia (1904) sinking on 9 November 1918.jpg|right|thumb|{{HMS|Britannia|1904|6}} sinking after being torpedoed by [[SM UB-50|''UB-50'']] on November 9, 1918.]]
Twelve American [[submarine chaser]]s under Captain [[Charles P. Nelson]] were part of [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|attack]] on the Austro-Hungarian held naval base at [[DurrÃ«s|Durazzo]], [[Albania]]. The battle began on October 11 with Italian and British aircraft bombarding Austro-Hungarian concentrations within the city while the allied fleet was still crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]]. When they arrived, the larger ships engaged shore batteries while the Americans plotted a path through a sea mine field and engaged two Austro-Hungarian submarines, {{SMU|U-29|Germany|2}} and {{SMU|U-31|Germany|2}}. Two destroyers and a [[torpedo boat]] were also damaged by American and British ships with help from some Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]] and one merchant vessel was sunk. In the end no Americans were hurt in the battle and the naval base was left in ruins. For his leadership and courage at Durrazo Captain Nelson received the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] as well as other foreign decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/nelson-dd-623.html |title= Nelson DD-623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 863-864.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coast Guard Captain [[Leroy Reinburg]] of {{USS|Druid|SP-321|6}} engaged enemy submarines near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in November 1918. The ''Druid'' was operating as part of the [[Gibraltar Barrage]], a squadron of American and British ships assigned to keeping enemy U-boats from passing from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic. On November 8, 1918, men aboard USS ''Druid'' sighted three surfaced submarines going through the strait. The weather was foul and the seas rough but the barrage squadron attacked anyway, first with gunfire and then with depth charges. {{HMS|Privet|1916|6}} reported that she shot a hole through one of the submarines' conning towers with a {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} gun but other than that no other damage was thought to have occurred. USS ''Druid'' and her compatriots were successful in defending the strait and on the following day the Americans helped rescue the British crew of the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Britannia|1904|6}} which had been torpedoed by [[SM UB-50|''UB-50'']] while passing through Gibraltar into the Mediterranean. The war ended three days later on November 11.&lt;ref name=Larzelere117&gt;Larzelere, p 117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pacific Ocean ===
American naval forces in the [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Pacific Theater]] of World War I were far removed from the conflict with Germany and the other [[Central Powers]]. Although Imperial Germany possessed Pacific colonies at the beginning of the war, all of the isolated colonies had easily been conquered by the Allies by 1915. The only significant United States naval presence in the Pacific was a [[cruiser]] squadron under [[Admiral]] [[Austin M. Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one engagement in the theater involving the United States, and it took place just one day after the United States declared war. In December 1914 the German [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SMS|Cormoran|1909|6}} was [[commerce raiding]] in the South Pacific, when her commander put in for provisions on the then neutral island of [[Guam]], a United States territory. Captain [[Adalbert Zuckschwerdt]] needed coal, but there was little to be had. As a result, the ship was stranded and her crew were interned for the next three years. When the war with Germany finally began on April 6, 1917, the old [[schooner]] {{USS|Supply|1873|6}} was ordered to demand the ''Cormoran'' surrender or be sunk. Captain Zuckschwerdt refused to hand over his ship, knowing it would be used against his country. Instead, he ordered his men to [[Scuttling of SMS Cormoran|scuttle]] her. In an attempt to prevent this, the captain of the USS ''Supply'' ordered the [[United States Marines]] on board to open fire on German crew. Nine German sailors would be killed, either by the rifle fire or the explosion that sank the ''Cormoran''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/supply-ii.html |title= Supply II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace button large.png|thumb|right|240px|A [[nuclear disarmament]] symbol, commonly called the "peace symbol"]]

'''World peace''', or '''peace on Earth''', is the concept of an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] state of happiness, [[freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[peace]] within and among all people and nations on earth. This idea of world [[non-violence]] is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie 
love and peace. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.

Various religious and secular organisations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine or [[diplomat|diplomacy]] used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the [[United Nations]] and the 5 [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[Security Council]] (the US, Russia, China, France and the UK) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==World peace theories==
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.

===Peace through strength===
{{Main|Peace through strength}}

The term is traced back to the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] (reigned AD 117 â 138) but the concept is as old as the recorded history. The Egyptian god [[Ptah]] says that [[Ramses II]]'s (1279â1213 BC) "strength" causes every country "to crave peace":
{{quote|
I have set for thee the might, victory and strength of thy mighty sword in every land ... I assign them to thy mighty sword ... I have thy terror in every heart ... I have set thy fear in every country, thy fear encircles the mountains, and the chiefs tremble at the mention of thee...; they come to thee, crying out together, to crave peace from thee.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Records of Egypt. Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest'', (ed. [[James Henry Breasted]], London: Nabu Press, 1988), vol III:408, p 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1943, at the peak of [[World War II]], the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], argued that after the War the United States is bound to take "command of the skies" to ensure the lasting world peace:
{{quote|
But the inauguration of such a glorious century of peace demands from us abandonment of old conceptions of peace. The new Angel of Peace must no longer be pictured as a charming but helpless lady with an olive branch in her hand, but like the Goddess of Justice with a balance in her left and a sword in her right; or like the Archangel Michael, with a fiery sword and wings of steel, fighting the devil to restore and protect the peace of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), p 299, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] at Offutt Air Base stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: "Peace is our profession."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Thomas S. Power]], ''Design for Survival'', (New York: Coward McCann, 1964), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The motto "was a staggering paradox that was also completely accurate."&lt;ref&gt;Phillip S. Meilinger, ''Bomber: The Formation and Early History of Strategic Air Command'', (Alabama: Air University Press, 2012), p XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; One SAC Bomberâ[[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|Convair B-36]]âis called ''Peacemaker'' and one inter-continental missile-[[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|LGM-118]]-''Peacekeeper''.

In 2016, former US Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] envisaged that the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will make the region "peaceful" through "strength": 
{{quote|
You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific ... realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play ... You'll do so with strength.&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of the Rebalance: Enabling Security in the Vital &amp; Dynamic Asia-Pacific," (Secretary of Defense Speech, September 29, 2016, Washington: Department of Defense), https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/959937/remarks-on-the-future-of-the-rebalance-enabling-security-in-the-vital-dynamic-a?source=GovDelivery&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Introduction to US National Security and Defense Strategies of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will "preserve peace through strength." The document proceeds to detail what "achieving peace through strength requires."&lt;ref&gt;US National Secusrity and Defense Strategies, (Washington: Department of Defense, 2018), p 1, 6, https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with ''peace through strength'' are concepts of ''preponderance of power'' (as opposed to [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]), [[hegemonic stability theory]], ''unipolar stability'', and imperial peace (such as [[Pax Romana]], [[Pax Britannica]], or [[Pax Americana]]).

===Marxism: World peace via world revolution===

World peace would be a consequence of the anarchist communist world. According to the dialectic materialist theory of Karl Marx, the humanity is divided in just 2 classes in capitalism, the proletarians -that do not possess the means of production- and the bourgeoisie -that possesses the means of production-, once that the communist revolution, that shall abolish the private propriety of the means of production, have happened, humanity will not be divided anymore and a lot of changes will happen. Through a period called socialism the dictatorship of the proletarians will take charge of getting rid of the last vestiges of capitalism, and help to make the revolution worldwide. Once the private propriety have been abolished worldwide, the state will not longer be useful and will disappear, because the government only exists to protect the dominant class, effectively dominating with violence and fear the submitted class, but there will not be classes anymore, and therefore none will require to dominate anyone. Instead organisations of workers will manage the production of things, but no organisation will have any military power, neither police force or prisons.

The main principle of Marx's theory is that the material conditions limit the spiritual conditions. People will not be violent but respecting, peaceful and altruistic, because the material conditions will finally allow them to be so. They do not longer need to live just aiming to earn money, but they live to develop themselves spiritually. With the material problems solved, and everyone receiving education and being provided  the appropriate circumstances for their intellectual development, there will not any problem, and society will work getting from each one what one has the capacity to give, and providing to each one what one need.

[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic peace theory===
Proponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy &amp; peace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355/Dyadic_Democratic_Peace_Strikes_Back_Reconstructing_the_Social_Constructivist_Approach_After_the_Monadic_Renaissance |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=MÃ¼ller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |booktitle=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id="Iraq and the democratic peace" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.

===Capitalism peace theory===
In her essay "The Roots of War", [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in historyâa period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized worldâfrom the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[SpanishâAmerican War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861â1865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.

===Cobdenism===
Proponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.

However, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].

More generally, free tradeâwhile not making wars impossibleâcan make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobbyâunless there are only national companiesâwill argue against wars.

===Mutual assured destruction===
[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Col. Alan J | last = Parrington | publisher = Air Force | place = USA | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | contribution = Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question | title = Airpower Journal | date = Winter 1997 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | archivedate = 20 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the policy of mutual assured destruction during the Cold War attributed this to the increase in the lethality of war to the point where it no longer offers the possibility of a net gain for either side, thereby making wars pointless.

===United Nations Charter and international law===
After World War II, the United Nations was established by the [[United Nations Charter]] to "save successive generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" (Preamble). The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider "the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and "peace in the world".

===Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War===
Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) with 10 article and 38 clauses is an international legal framework drafted by HWPL International Law Peace Committee, composed of international law experts from 15 countries. DPCW is proclaimed as a law for peace, which promotes the engagement of civil society actors, by provoking their advocacy and promoting voluntary practices of democratic values, as peace is considered difficult to be achieved only by the voices of the elites or with current institutions. 

The Preambles of DPCW are:1. Prohibit the threat or use of force; 2. Reduce war potential and repurpose weapons to benefit humanity; 3. Develop friendly relations and prohibit acts of aggression; 4. Prohibit coercion against internationally recognised state boundaries; 5. Ensure the right to self-determination of peoples of states; 6. Settle international disputes through peaceful means; 7. Acknowledge the right to self-defence; 8. Foster religious freedom; 9. Promote peaceful coexistence amongst religious and ethnic groups; 10. Spread a culture of peace.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwpl.kr/en/initiative/lawForPeace&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the global movement of support from civil society, increasing awareness and support of DPCW from former and current heads of states, civil society actors and government representatives from different countries are received such that the legal document to be submitted and introduced into the UN. 

===Globalization===
[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].

===Self-organized peace===
World peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including Wikipedia, and the evolution of other [[social media]].

===Economic norms theory===
[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52â86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002â2003 | pages = 5â29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through most of human history societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483â510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Market-oriented socio-economies are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state.  This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract â that is, liberal democracy.  Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad.  In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003" /&gt; and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009" /&gt;

Economic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago : University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the "social market" economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].

==International Day of Peace==
The [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.

==Religious views==
[[File:Mt._Ecclesia-3.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A long-standing suggestion for World Peace Meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen050.htm Suggestion For World Peace Meditation]. [[Mount Ecclesia]], CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; along with annual purposeful devotional dates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/docs/dates2017s_eng.pdf World Peace Meditation: 2017 Devotional Services Dates and Times]. Mount Ecclesia, CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; as faithfully performed by a [[fraternal organization]] whose founder taught, in the 1910s, that "'''[[Peace education|Peace is a matter of education]]''', and impossible of achievement until we have learned to deal charitably, justly, and openly with one another, as nations as well as [[individual]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]]. ''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.

===BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith===
{{Main|BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The central aim of the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h]], the founder of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, "the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ..." In His writings, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h described two distinct stages of world peace â a lesser peace and a most great peace.

The lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. BahÃ¡'Ã­s believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that BahÃ¡'Ã­ influence on the process is relatively minor.

The most great peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity â a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The BahÃ¡'Ã­s view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of BahÃ¡'Ã­ teachings, principles and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=363â364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism}}
Many [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if we first establish [[peace]] within our minds. The idea is that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as love and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typically of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organisation [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo and [[Lumbini]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
The basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:

{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}

As christologically interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  "Word of the Lord" is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works in direct light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned Sermon on the Mount, where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.

However, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:

{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-lawâa man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34â36|NIV}}}}

Many Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the "new earth" that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.

The [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of "[[Consecration of Russia]]", related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of FÃ¡tima|FÃ¡tima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
Traditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudha eka kutumbakam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&amp;page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes â Page 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "The world is one family." The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal meansâby liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic Peace}}

According to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of prophet [[Jesus in Islam|Isa ]] in his [[second coming]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Kitab Ahadith al-Ambiya; Bab: Nuzul 'Isa Ibn Maryam; Muslim, Bab: Bayan Nuzul 'Isa; Tirmidhi, Abwab-al-Fitan; Bab Fi Nuzul 'Isa; Musnad Ahmad, Marwiyat Abu Huraira.http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/M_fop/fop11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in likeness of [[paradise]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism}}

The concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally "a King appointed by God") will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11â12&lt;/ref&gt; This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].
{{quote|And he shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples, and they shall beat their [[Swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift the sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|JPR}}}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism}}
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]].They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahvira [[Jiyo aur Jeeno Do]] Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: "May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikhism}}
Peace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat karÅ]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[chaá¹dÄ« kalÄ]]'', or ''optimistic'' â ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharingâ''[[vaá¹á¸ chakkÅ]]''âthrough the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|laá¹gar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|sÄvÄ]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

==Economic implications==
A report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
