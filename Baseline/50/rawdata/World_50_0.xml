[[File:Conflict minerals 961w.jpg|thumb|Four common conflict minerals, clockwise from top left: [[coltan]], [[cassiterite]], [[gold]] ore, and [[wolframite]].]]
'''Conflict resources''' are [[natural resource]]s extracted in a [[conflict zone]] and sold to perpetuate the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005–06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a "[[Resource curse#Conflict|resource curse]]").&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Le Billon, "Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts", Adelphi Paper 373, IISS &amp; Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ross,"How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War? Evidence from Thirteen Cases", International Organization, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Fearon and David lotinakin "Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War" [[American Political Science Review]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent contemporary example has been the eastern provinces of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), where various armies, rebel groups, and outside actors have profited from mining while contributing to violence and exploitation during wars in the region.

The four most commonly mined '''conflict minerals''' (known as 3TGs, from their initials)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assentcompliance.com/conflict-minerals-consulting-services/|title=Assent Compliance|author=|date=|website=Assent Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[cassiterite]] (for [[tin]]), [[wolframite]] (for [[tungsten]]), [[coltan]] (for [[tantalum]]), and [[gold]] ore, which are extracted from the eastern Congo, and passed through a variety of intermediaries before being purchased. These minerals are essential in the manufacture of a variety of devices, including [[consumer electronics]] such as mobile phones, laptops, and MP3 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Dias |date=July 24, 2009 |title=First Blood Diamonds, Now Blood Computers? |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912594,00.html |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1B1lxV6?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1912594%2C00.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraction and sale of [[blood diamond]]s, also known as "conflict diamonds", is a better-known phenomenon which occurs under virtually identical conditions. Even [[petroleum]] can be a conflict resource; [[Oil production and smuggling in ISIL|ISIS used oil revenue]] to finance its military and terrorist activities.

International efforts to reduce trade in conflict resources, tried to reduce incentives to extract and fight over them. For example, in the United States, the 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502, known as the "Conflict Mineral Law", to be enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; required manufacturers to audit their [[supply chain]]s and report use of conflict minerals.  In 2015 a US [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals court]] struck down some aspects of the reporting requirements as a violation of [[Corporate personhood|corporations’ freedom of speech]], but left others in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43639.pdf |title=Conflict Minerals and Resource Extraction: Dodd-Frank, SEC Regulations, and Legal Challenges |author=Michael V. Seitzinger |author2=Kathleen Ann Ruane |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=May 1, 2016 | date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict [[commodity]]' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to the '[[conflict diamonds]]' that were financing rebellions in Angola and [[Sierra Leone]]. (The media often called these '[[blood diamonds]]'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/808608.stm
|title=  'Blood diamonds' crackdown deal
|publisher= BBC News |quote=''[[Peter Hain]]'': without blood diamonds, the war in Sierra Leone could not be financed... In the face of enormous suffering caused by the diamond-fuelled wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], we have a duty to ensure that we are doing as much as we can
|accessdate=2010-06-05 |date= 2000-06-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then 'conflict timber' financed hostilities in Cambodia and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/liberian-conflict-timber-faces-trade-ban

|accessdate=2010-06-05 |date= 2003-05-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conventions ===
The concept was first officially discussed by the [[UN General Assembly]] in the context of 'conflict diamonds':&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_Resolution_e.pdf UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108001135/http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_resolution_e.pdf |date=2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Security Council]] has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions.{{which|date=May 2016}}

[[Global Witness]] has called for an international standardized definition to facilitate a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of [[war profiteer]]s suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161842/http://www.humansecuritybulletin.info/page434.htm]"

Since 1996 the [[Bonn International Center for Conversion]] has tracked ''resource governance'' and ''conflict intensity'' by country.&lt;ref&gt;Accessible through
{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[fossil fuel]]s, metals, diamonds, and timber it tracks the [[governance]] of other [[Raw material|primary goods]] that might fund conflicts, including: [[poppy seed]]s and [[talc]] (Afghanistan), [[rubber]] (Côte d'Ivoire), [[cotton]] (Zambia), and [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] (Indonesia).

== Conflict minerals ==

The four most prominent conflict minerals, for example codified in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Law, are:

*'''Columbite-tantalite''' (or ''[[coltan]]'', the colloquial African term) is the metal ore from which the element [[tantalum]] is extracted.  Tantalum is used primarily for the production of [[tantalum capacitor]]s, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from [[hearing aid]]s and [[pacemaker]]s, to [[airbag]]s, [[GPS]], ignition systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tantalum – Raw Materials and Processing |url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |publisher=Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BooEpq?url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools.
*'''Cassiterite''' is the chief ore needed to produce [[tin]], essential for the production of tin cans and the [[solder]] on the circuit boards of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |publisher=Mineral Information Institute |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1C3xwLJ?url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin is also commonly a component of biocides, fungicides and as tetrabutyl tin/tetraoctyl tin, an intermediate in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and high performance paint manufacturing.
*'''[[Wolframite]]''' is an important source of the element [[tungsten]]. Tungsten is a very dense metal and is frequently used for this property, such as in fishing weights, dart tips and golf club heads. Like [[tantalum carbide]], [[tungsten carbide]] possesses hardness and wear resistance properties and is frequently used in applications like metalworking tools, drill bits and milling. Smaller amounts are used to substitute lead in "green ammunition".&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tungsten |first=Kim B. |last=Shedd |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2000 |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CK1wyQ?url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal amounts are used in electronic devices, including the vibration mechanism of cell phones.
*'''Gold''' is used in jewelry, electronics, and dental products. It is also present in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes.

These are sometimes referred to as "''the 3T's and gold''", ''3TG'', or even simply the "''3T's''".  Under the US Conflict Minerals Law, additional minerals may be added to this list in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-26.htm |title=Remarks on not adding niobium to the list |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democratic Republic of the Congo ==

Armed conflict and mineral resource looting by the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese National Army]] and various armed rebel groups, including the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) and the [[National Congress for the Defense of the People]] (CNDP), a proxy Rwandan militia group, has occurred throughout the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Additionally, the looting of the Congo's natural resources is not limited to domestic actors. During the Congo Wars ([[First Congo War]] (1996–1997) and [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003)), Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi particularly profited from the Congo's resources. These governments continued to smuggle resources out of the Congo to this day.{{Citation needed|reason=likely true, but a serious charge that requires proof|date=May 2016}}

The profits from the sale of these minerals have financed fighting in the Second Congo War and ongoing follow-on conflicts. Control of lucrative mines has also itself become a military objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Witness Report: 'Faced with a gun, what can you do?' |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |publisher=[[Global Witness]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1AhKWsY?url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mines ===
Mines, in eastern Congo, are often located far from populated areas in remote and dangerous regions. A recent study by International Peace Information Service (IPIS) indicates that armed groups are present at more than 50% of mining sites. At many sites, armed groups illegally tax, extort, and coerce civilians to work.  Miners, including children, work up to 48-hour shifts amidst mudslides and tunnel collapses that kill many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Congo's Riches, Looted by Renegade Troops |first = Lydia |last = Polgreen |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |date = November 15, 2008 |accessdate = December 16, 2010 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BQBTW8?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?_r=1&amp;&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate = December 16, 2010 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are often affiliated with rebel groups, or with the Congolese National Army, but both use rape and violence to control the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Crisis in East Congo Tied to Mining Activity |first=Dominique |last=Soguel |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |work=[[Women's eNews]] |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1Bd15JZ?url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States law ==
In April 2009, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 (S. 891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/891|title=S.891 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009|first=Brownback,|last=Sam|date=23 April 2009|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of cassiterite, wolframite, and tantalum. This legislation died in committee. However, Brownback added similar language as Section 1502 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which passed Congress and was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.steptoe.com/publications-7050.html New Corporate Social Responsibility Mandate Related to Conflict Materials in the New Financial Reform Bill Could Affect Many Companies]" (July 20, 2010). Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) draft regulations to implement the Conflict Mineral Law, published in the [[Federal Register]] of December 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80948 – 80975&lt;/ref&gt; would have required U.S. and certain foreign companies to report and make public their use of so-called "conflict minerals" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries in their products. Comments on this proposal were extended until March 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2011/34-63793.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The comments on the proposal were reviewable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml |title=Comments on File No. s7-40-10 |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report on the proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/sec-provides-preview-of-april-15-final-rules-on-conflict-minerals-supply-chain-traceability/ |title=SEC Provides Preview of April 15 Final Rules on Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Traceability &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following statistics for the submitted comments:
* Slightly more than 700 comment letters were submitted to SEC on the proposal;
* Approximately 65% of those were form letters or basic letters from the general public supporting the rule's intent;
* The remaining 35% (roughly 270) represent views of businesses, trade/industry associations, the investment/financial community, professional auditing firms, and other relevant governmental entities; and
* Of those 270 comments, an estimated 200 contained substantive and/or technical comments.
That report also contained what it calls a "preview of the final SEC regulations" synthesized from their detailed research and analysis of a large body of documents, reports and other information on the law, proposed regulation and the current budget/political setting facing the SEC in the current administration.

The final rule went into effect 13 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC rule did not go unnoticed by the international community, including entities seeking to undermine traceability efforts.  A report published by a metals trading publication illustrated one DRC ore/mineral flow method that has apparently been devised to thwart detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/24/loophole-in-conflict-minerals-law-creates-opportunity-for-scrap-dealers/ |title=Loophole in Conflict Minerals Law Creates Opportunity for Scrap Dealers |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, the US State Department issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eeb/diamonds/docs/168632.htm |title=Statement Concerning Implementation of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Legislation Concerning Conflict Minerals Due Diligence |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject.  Section 1502(c) of the Law mandates that the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] work in conjunction with SEC on certain elements of conflict minerals policy development and support.

On October 23, 2012 U.S. State Dept Officials asserted that ultimately, it falls on the U.S. State Dept. to determine when this rule would no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Dept of State &amp; Intelleges Webinar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8H947wuCNI|publisher=Intelleges|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down several parts of the SEC Rules as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/14/us-court-sec-conflictminerals-idUSBREA3D13U20140414|title=U.S. appeals court finds conflict-minerals rule violates free speech|first=Sarah N.|last=Lynch|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditing and reporting requirements ===
US Conflict Minerals Law contains two requirements that are closely connected: 
*independent third party supply chain traceability audits
* reporting of audit information to the public and SEC.

Even companies not directly regulated by the SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements because they will be pushed down through entire supply chains, including privately held and foreign-owned companies.

SEC estimated that 1,199 "issuers" (i.e., companies subject to filing other SEC reports) will be required to submit full conflict mineral reports.  This estimate was developed by finding the amount of tantalum produced by the DRC in comparison to global production (15% – 20%).  The Commission selected the higher figure of 20% and multiplied that by 6,000 (the total number of "issuers" SEC will be required to do initial product/process evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg 80966&lt;/ref&gt;  This estimate does not account for the companies who supply materials to the "issuers" (but are not themselves SEC-regulated) but who will almost certainly be required to conduct conflict minerals audits to meet the demands of those customers.  Other estimates indicate that the total number of US companies likely impacted may exceed 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/25/conflict-minerals-law-supply-chain-due-diligence-and-impact-on-metal-buying-organizations-part-three/ |title=Conflict Minerals Law, Supply Chain Due Diligence and Impact on Metal Buying Organizations – Part Three |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the potential impact of the regulation in early 2011 by the ''[[IPC (electronics)|IPC – Association Connecting Electronic Industries]]'' trade association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/ |title=Association Connecting Electronics Industries |publisher=IPC |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted with the association's comments to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipc.org/3.0_Industry/3.3_Gov_Relations/2011/IPC-SEC-NPRM-Comments-030311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The study states that the IPC survey respondents had a median of 163 direct suppliers.  Applying that number to the SEC's estimated number of impacted issuers results in the possibility of over 195,000 businesses that could be subject to some level of supply chain traceability effort.

==== Applicability in general ====
Under the law, companies have to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC if: 
*(a) they are required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934 
*(b) conflict minerals are ''necessary to the functionality or production of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured.'' That statement contains two separate – but critical concepts: the purpose of the conflict mineral in the product/process, and the control that the company exerts over the manufacturing process/specifications.

A company would be deemed to contract an item to be manufactured if it:
*Exerts any influence over the manufacturing process; or,
*Offers a generic product under its own brand name or a separate brand name (regardless of whether the company has any influence over the manufacturing process) and the company contracted to have the product manufactured specifically for itself.

This language implied that some retailers who are not manufacturers might be subject to the audit and disclosure requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sandler, Travis  |author2=Rosenberg, P.A. |title=Client Advisory: Retailers May Be Subject to Proposed SEC Conflict Mineral Reporting Requirements |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2016|url=http://www.strtrade.com/advisory.aspx?id=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Contracting to manufacture" a product requires some actual influence over the manufacturing of process that product, a determination based on facts and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Adopts Rule for Disclosing Use of Conflict Minerals|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company is not to be deemed to have influence over the manufacturing process if it merely:
* Affixes its brand, marks, logo, or label to a generic product manufactured by a third party.
* Services, maintains, or repairs a product manufactured by a third party.
* Specifies or negotiates contractual terms with a manufacturer that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the product.

The proposed regulations attempted to clarify that tools used in assembly and manufacturing will not trigger the law.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80953&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent was to cover minerals/metals in the final product only. Nothing specifically addresses intermediate chemical processes that use chemicals that contain conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, some electronic components use chemical solutions containing gold at some point in the manufacturing processes.  Tin is used during the chemical processes for manufacturing PVC and certain high performance paints/coatings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, neither the law nor the proposed regulation established a [[de minimis]] quantity or other form of materiality threshold that would preclude the applicability of the auditing/reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80963&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supply chain traceability auditing ====

The law mandates the use of an "independent private sector auditor" to conduct the audits. SEC has proposed two different standards for the audits: the "reasonable inquiry" and the "[[due diligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80956&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the final rule include this structure, the reasonable inquiry would be the first step to determine if the company can on its own, using reasonable efforts and trustworthy information, make a reliable determination as to the source/origin of its tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold.  Where companies are unable to make such a determination for any reason, they would then be required to take the next step of the "due diligence", which is the independent private sector audit.

The statute specified that the audits be "conducted in accordance with standards established by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]], in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission." This means that the same auditing standards that apply to other SEC auditing requirements will apply to conflict minerals audits &lt;ref name="Section 1502b"&gt;Section 1502(b).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this language, SEC will have little discretion to allow companies to issue self-generated statements or certifications to satisfy the law.

Third party audits for conflict minerals supply chain traceability began in summer 2010 under the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a US-based electronics manufacturing trade association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102203237/http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf |date=November 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this program, EICC selected three audit firms to conduct the actual audits, with two of the three participating in the pilot audits in 2010. After concluding the pilot, one of the two firms involved in 2010 withdrew from the program specifically in response to the SEC's proposal and to reduce potential legal risks to the audited entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Global-Focus-News/Conflict-Minerals-Sustainability-and-Audit-Services-to-Align-with-US-SEC-Audit-Standards/50$13230 |title=Find It: |publisher=Sdcexec.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the law nor the proposed regulations provide guidance on what will be considered an acceptable audit scope or process, preferring to allow companies the flexibility meeting the requirement in a manner that is responsive to their own individual business and supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80957&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the law contains a provision that preserves the government's rights to deem any report, audit or other due diligence processes as being unreliable, and in such cases, the report shall not satisfy the requirements of the regulations,&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502(b)&lt;/ref&gt; further emphasizing the need for such audits to conform to established SEC auditing standards. Comments on the proposed regulation pointed out that, should SEC not specify an applicable audit standard, it cannot also be silent or ambiguous on the auditor standards as well, or the Commission will violate the plain language of the Law mandating "standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States".&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;See numerous comments filed at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally expected that SEC will provide specificity on both the audit standard and the auditor standard.  SEC's proposal attempted to clarify its position on auditor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80958&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3675,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |doi=10.1787/factbook-2010-en |publisher=Oecd.org |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; published its Guidance on conflict minerals supply chain traceability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/36/0,3746,en_2649_34889_44307940_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance is gaining much momentum as "the" standard within US policy.  However, a recent critical analysis of the standard in comparison to existing US auditing standards under SEC highlighted a number of significant inconsistencies and conflict with relevant US standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/oecd-to-sec-make-us-the-conflict-minerals-due-diligenceaudit-standard-for-the-us/ |title=OECD to SEC: Make us the Conflict Minerals Due Diligence/Audit Standard for the US &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies subject to the US law who implement the OECD Guidance without regard for the SEC auditing standards may face legal compliance risks.

==== Reporting and disclosure ====
Companies subject to the SEC reporting requirement would be required to disclose whether the minerals used in their products originated in the DRC or adjoining countries (as defined above). The law mandates that this reporting be submitted/made available annually. Many comments to the proposed regulation asked SEC to clarify whether the report must be "furnished"—meaning it is made available to SEC but not directly incorporated within the company's formal financial report—or "submitted"—meaning the report is directly incorporated into the financial report.&lt;ref name="sec.gov" /&gt;  At first glance, this may appear to be a minor point; however, this difference is very important in determining the audit/auditor standards and related liabilities.

If it is determined that none of the minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries, the report must include a statement to that effect and provide an explanation of the country of origin analysis that was used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion. On the other hand, if conflict minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries were used (or if it is not possible to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals used), companies would be required to state as such in the annual report. In either case, companies would also be required to make this information public by posting their annual conflict minerals report on their websites, and providing the SEC with the internet addresses where the reports may be found. Further, the proposed regulations would require companies to maintain records relating to the country of origin of conflict minerals used in their products.

Media outlets have reported that many companies required to file Specialized Disclosure Reports to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and any necessary conflict minerals reports for 2013 under the SEC’s conflict minerals rule are struggling to meet the June 2, 2014 report filing deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hills|first=Mark E.|title=Deadline Looms for Conflict Mineral Disclosure Requirements: Update for Suppliers of Reporting Companies|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/deadline-looms-conflict-mineral-disclosure-requirements-update-suppliers-reporting-c|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=16 May 2014|author2=Jacob A.

=== Criticism of the law ===
The law has been criticised for not addressing the root causes of the conflict, leaving to the Congolese government the responsibility for providing an environment in which companies can practice due diligence and legitimately purchase the minerals they need, when the reality is that mechanisms for transparency do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.undispatch.com/digging-deeper-into-the-dodd-frank-congo-blood-minerals-controversy | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=Digging Deeper Into the Dodd-Frank Congo ‘Blood Minerals’ Controversy | date=Aug 9, 2011 | work=UN Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been to halt legitimate mining ventures that provided livelihoods for people, reducing the Congo's legal exports of tantalum by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-rule-aimed-at-warlords-upends-african-mines-08042011.html | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=A Rule Aimed at Warlords Upends African Mines | date=Aug 4, 2011 | work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that most companies were unable to determine the source of their conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672051.pdf ''SEC CONFLICT MINERALS RULE: Initial Disclosures Indicate Most Companies Were Unable to Determine the Source of Their Conflict Minerals''], GAO-15-561: Published: Aug 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed law in Europe ==
The European Parliament passed legislation in 2015; negotiations are currently underway among member states as to specific wording details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150513IPR55318/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-ask-for-mandatory-certification-of-EU-importers |title=Conflict minerals: MEPs ask for mandatory certification of EU importers |date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |author=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2016 the European Parliament confirmed that "mandatory due diligence" would be required for "all but the smallest EU firms importing tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160615IPR32320/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-secure-mandatory-due-diligence-for-importers Conflict minerals: MEPs secure mandatory due diligence for importers], Press Release issued 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017 the EU passed Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the Parliament and of the Council on the supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores, and gold from conflict-affected and high risk areas. The regulation will take effect in January 2021, and will directly apply to companies that import 3TG metals into the EU, no matter where they originate.&lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32017R0821&amp;qid=1542740800246 Content is copied from this source, which is (c) European Union, 1995-2018.

== Conflict resources in supply chains ==
Increases in business process outsourcing to globally dispersed production facilities means that social problems and human rights violations are no longer only an organization matter, but also often occur in companies’ supply chains, and challenge for supply chain managers.&lt;ref name="SCDD"&gt;Hannes Hofmann, Martin C. Schleper, Constantin Blome: ''Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Due Diligence: An Exploratory Study of Multitier Supply Chains.'' In: ''Journal of Business Ethics.'' DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the harm conflict minerals do where they are produced, human rights violations also raise an enormous risk to corporate reputations. Consumers, mass media and employees expect companies to behave responsibly and have become intolerant of those who don't.

Consequently, firms that are located downstream in the supply chain and that are more visible to stakeholders are particularly threatened by social supply chain problems. The recent debate concerning conflict minerals illustrates the importance of social and human rights issues in supply chain management practice as well as the emerging need to react to social conflicts. Conflict minerals are processed in many different components throughout various industries and hence have a high overall impact on business.
 
Initiatives like the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas&lt;ref name ="OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; demand that supply chain managers verify purchased goods as ‘‘conflict-free’’ or implement measures to better manage any inability to do so.

Minerals mined in Eastern Congo pass through the hands of numerous middlemen as they are shipped out of Congo, through neighboring countries such as [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]], to East Asian processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR-CONGO: Firms Fuelling 'Conflict Minerals' Violence, Report Says |first=Marina |last=Litvinsky |url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |agency=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CoG37B?url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, the US Conflict Minerals Law applies to materials originating (or claimed to originate) from the DRC as well as the nine adjoining countries: [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Congo Republic]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].

Firms have begun to apply governance mechanisms to avoid adverse effects of conflict mineral sourcing. However, the mere transfer of responsibilities upstream in the supply chain apparently will not stop the trade with conflict minerals, notably due to two reasons: 
*On the one hand, globalization has created governance gaps in a sense that companies are able to abuse human rights without being sanctioned by independent third parties. This gap results in a non-allocation of responsibility that makes the problem of human rights abuses and social conflicts within dispersed supply chains very likely to endure, particularly without collaborative approaches to remedy these deficiencies. 
*On the other hand, conflict minerals usually originate from globally diverse deposits and are difficult to track within components and manufactured products. This is the case because they are mixed with minerals of different origin and added to metal alloys.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Consequently, although the share of these minerals in single end products may be negligible, they are prevalent in numerous products and commodities. Together, these circumstances leave downstream firms nearly incapable of detecting risks associated with conflict minerals. Hence, the topic of conflict minerals becomes one of supply chain management rather than of individual companies’ legal or compliance divisions alone. What is needed is effective and supply-chain wide-mechanisms of traceability and due diligence that allow firms to take individual and collective responsibility as parts of supply chains.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

In the context of mineral supply chains, due diligence represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows through the creation of a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation patterns of supply chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

Moreover, [[FairPhone]] Foundation raises awareness of conflict minerals in the mobile industry and is a company which tries to produce a smart phone with 'fair' conditions along the supply chain. Various industry and trade associations are also monitoring developments in conflict minerals laws and traceability frameworks.  Some of these represent electronics, retailers, jewelry, mining, electronics components, and general manufacturing sectors.  One organization – ITRI (a UK-based international non-profit organization  representing the tin industry and sponsored/supported by its members, principally miners and smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_ITRI_ABOUTART_16/_firsttitle.xsl/4 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had spearheaded efforts for the development and implementation of a "bag and tag" scheme at the mine as a key element of credible traceability.&lt;ref&gt;An overview and timeline of ITRI's activities on conflict minerals can be seen here – {{cite web |url=http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206154403/http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program and related efforts were initially not likely to extend beyond the pilot phase due to a variety of implementation and funding problems that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_322557 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end however, the device did enter the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairphone.com/#roadmap|title=Fairphone|author=|date=|website=Fairphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2011, the UK government launched an informational section on its Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website dedicated to conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Office launches conflict minerals information for businesses |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929120441/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |archivedate=September 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information resource is intended to assist British companies in understanding the issues and, specifically, the US requirements.

On Jan 6th 2014, the semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would distance itself from conflict minerals. As a result, all Intel microprocessors henceforth will be conflict-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|title=Starting Now, All Intel Microprocessors Are Conflict-Free: Here's How The Company Did It|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024292/starting-now-all-intel-microprocessors-are-conflict-free-heres-how-the-company-did-it|work=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial reporting solutions ==

Manufacturers and supply chain partners needing to comply with the ever-increasing reporting regulations have a few commercial options available.

A major research report from November 2012 by the Southern Africa Resource Watch revealed that gold miners in the east of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] were being exploited by corrupt government officials, bureaucrats and security personnel, who all demand illegal tax, fees and levies from the miners without delivering any services in return. Despite the alleged gold rush in regions of the country, none of the population and workforce is benefiting from this highly lucrative industry.&lt;ref name="ALL" /&gt;

'''DXing''' is the hobby of receiving and identifying distant [[radio]] or [[Terrestrial television|television]] signals, or making two way radio contact with distant stations in [[amateur radio]], [[citizens' band radio]] or other two way radio communications. Many DXers also attempt to obtain written verifications of reception or contact, sometimes referred to as "[[QSL card|QSL]]s" or "veries". The name of the hobby comes from DX, [[telegraph]]ic [[shorthand]] for "distance" or "distant".&lt;ref name="Intro_DX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dxing.info/introduction.dx |title=''Introduction To DXing'' |author=Mika Mäkeläinen |publisher=DXing.info |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of DXing arose during the early days of [[radio broadcasting]]. Listeners would mail "reception reports" to radio broadcasting stations in hopes of getting a written acknowledgement or a QSL card that served to officially verify they had heard a distant station. Collecting these cards became popular with radio listeners in the 1920s and 1930s, and reception reports were often used by early broadcasters to gauge the effectiveness of their transmissions. Although international shortwave broadcasts are on the decline, DXing remains popular among dedicated shortwave listeners. The pursuit of two-way contact between distant amateur radio operators is also a significant activity within the amateur radio hobby.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jerome S. Berg |title=Listening on the Short Waves, 1945 to Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA330 |accessdate=November 12, 2016 |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6 |pages=330–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan J.

== Types of DXing ==
=== AM radio DX ===
{{Main|MW DX}}

Early radio listeners, often using home made [[crystal set]]s and long wire antennas, found radio stations few and far between. With the broadcast bands uncrowded, signals of the most powerful stations could be heard over hundreds of miles, but weaker signals required more precise tuning or better receiving gear.

By the 1950s, and continuing through the mid-1970s, many of the most powerful [[North America]]n "[[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]]" stations such as [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], [[WLW]], [[CKLW]], [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]], [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], [[WJR]], [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], [[WWKB|WKBW]], [[KFI]], [[KAAY]], [[KSL (radio)|KSL]] and a host of [[border blaster]]s from [[Mexico]] pumped out [[Top 40]] music played by popular [[disc jockey]]s. As most smaller, local [[AM radio]] stations had to sign off at night, the big 50 [[kilowatt|kW]] stations had loyal listeners hundreds of miles away.

The popularity of DXing the medium-wave band has diminished as the [[popular music]] formats quickly migrated to the clearer, though less propagating, [[FM radio]] beginning in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the MW band in the [[United States]] was getting more and more crowded with new stations and existing stations receiving [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC authorization]] to operate at night. In [[Canada]], just the opposite occurred as AM stations began moving to FM beginning in the 1980s and continuing through today.

Outside of the Americas and Australia, most AM radio broadcasting was in the form of synchronous networks of government-operated stations, operating with hundreds, even thousands of kilowatts of power. Still, the lower powered stations and occasional trans-oceanic signal were popular DX targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dxing.com/amband.htm ''AM Band DXing'', DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortwave DX ===
{{main|Shortwave listening}}
Especially during wartime and times of conflict, reception of international broadcasters, whose signals propagate around the world on the [[shortwave bands]] has been popular with both casual listeners and DXing hobbyists.

With the rise in popularity of [[streaming audio]] over the internet, many international broadcasters (including the [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]) have cut back on their shortwave broadcasts. [[Missionary]] [[Religious broadcasting|Religious broadcasters]] still make extensive use of [[shortwave radio]] to reach less developed countries around the world.

In addition to international broadcasters, the shortwave bands also are home to [[military communication]]s, [[radioteletype|RTTY]], [[amateur radio]], [[pirate radio]], and the mysterious broadcasts of [[numbers station]]s. Many of these signals are transmitted in single [[Sideband|side band]] mode, which requires the use of specialized receivers more suitable to DXing than to casual listening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dxing.info/introduction.dx ''Introduction To DXing''. DXing.info&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VHF DXing ===
{{Main|TV-FM DX}}

Though sporadic in nature, signals on the FM broadcast and [[VHF]] [[television]] bands - especially those stations at the lower end of these bands - can "skip" for hundreds, even thousands of miles. North American FM stations have been received in [[Western Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hattam|first1=Mark|title=Trans-Atlantic FM|url=http://www.dxradio.co.uk/transatlanticfm.php|website=dxradio.co.uk|publisher=DX Radio|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European TV signals have been received on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast of the U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio-electronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psUpAQAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Gernsback Publications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police, fire, and military communications on the VHF bands are also DX'ed to some extent on multi-band [[radio scanner]]s, though they are mainly listened to strictly on a local basis. One difficulty is in identifying the exact origins of communications of this nature, as opposed to commercial broadcasters which must identify themselves at the top of each hour, and can often be identified through mentions of sponsors, slogans, etc. throughout their programming.

=== Amateur radio DX ===
{{main|Amateur radio}}
[[Amateur radio operator]]s who specialize in making two way radio contact with other amateurs in distant countries are also referred to as "DXers". On the [[high frequency|HF]] (also known as [[shortwave]]) amateur bands, DX stations are those in foreign [[country|countries]]. On the [[very high frequency|VHF]]/[[ultra high frequency|UHF]] amateur bands, DX stations can be within the same [[country]] or [[continent]], since making a long-distance VHF contact, without the help of a [[satellite]], can be very difficult. DXers collect QSL cards as proof of contact and can earn special certificates and awards from amateur radio organizations.&lt;ref name="GregorySahre2003" /&gt; 

In addition, many [[Club (organization)|clubs]] offer awards for communicating with a certain number of DX stations. For example, the [[American Radio Relay League|ARRL]] offers the [[DX Century Club]] award, or [[DXCC]]. The basic certificate is awarded for working and confirming at least 100 entities on the ARRL DXCC List.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrl.org/awards/dxcc/dxcclist.txt DXCC List - ARRL&lt;/ref&gt; For award purposes, other areas than just political [[countries]] can be classified as "DX countries". For example, the French territory of [[Reunion Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] is counted as a DX country, even though it is a [[Regions of France|region of France]]. The rules for determining what is a DX country can be quite complex and to avoid potential confusion, radio amateurs often use the term ''entity'' instead of country. In addition to entities, some awards are based on [[island]] groups in the world's [[oceans]]. On the [[very high frequency|VHF]]/[[ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands, many radio amateurs pursue awards based on [[Maidenhead grid locator]]s. 

In order to give other amateurs a chance to confirm contacts at new or exotic locations, amateurs have mounted [[DXpedition]]s to countries or regions that have no permanent base of amateur radio operators.&lt;ref name="GregorySahre2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Danny Gregory|author2=Paul Sahre|title=Hello world: a life in ham radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMhgwa2_s2EC&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=4 April 2012|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-281-6|pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also frequent [[contesting|contests]] where radio amateurs operate their stations on certain dates for a fixed period of time to try to communicate with as many DX stations as possible.

== DX Clubs ==
Many radio enthusiasts are members of DX clubs. There are many DX clubs in many countries around the world. They are useful places to find information about up-to-date news relating to international radio. Many people also enjoy social events, which can form a large part of the enjoyment that people can get out of the radio hobby.

== QSL cards ==
{{Main|QSL card}}
[[File:QSL-VOA-Thessaloniki-1972.jpg|thumb|right|QSL card from Voice of America]]
One of the interesting sides of DXing as a hobby is collecting QSL cards (acknowledgement cards from the broadcaster) confirming the listener's reception report (sometimes called SINPO report, see next section).

Usually a QSL card will have a picture on one side and the reception data on the other. Most of the broadcasters will use pictures and messages indicating their country's culture or technological life.

== SINPO report ==
[[SINPO]] stands for the following qualities, graded on a scale of 1 to 5, where '1' means the quality was very bad and '5' very good.

S - Signal strength&lt;br/&gt;
I - Interference with other stations or broadcasters&lt;br/&gt;
N - Noise ratio in the received signal&lt;br/&gt;
P - Propagation (ups and downs of the reception)&lt;br/&gt;
O - Overall merit

Although this is a subjective measure, with practise the grading becomes more consistent, and a particular broadcast may be assessed by several listeners from the same area, in which case the broadcaster could assess correspondence between reports.

After listening to a broadcast, the listener writes a report with SINPO values, typically including his geographical location (called QTH in amateur radio terminology) in longitude and latitude, the types of receiver and antennae used, the frequency the transmission was heard on, a brief description of the programme listened to, their opinion about it, suggestions if any, and so on.

The listener can send the report to the broadcaster either by post or email, and request verification (QSL) from them.

Variants of this report are:
a) the SIO report which omits the Noise and Propagation,
b) grading on a scale of 1 to 3 (instead of 1 to 5) and
c) the SINFO report where the F stands for fading.

== DX Communication ==
'''DX communication''' is communication over large or relatively uncommon distances. On the [[UHF]] or [[VHF]] bands which are typically used for short range or line of sight communications, DX may represent communication with stations 50 or 100 miles away. The UHF and microwave bands have also been used to accomplish [[Earth–Moon–Earth communication]] between stations worldwide.&lt;ref name="Silver2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Ward Silver|title=The ARRL Extra Class License Manual for Ham Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcbjKvhgPLsC&amp;pg=SA2-PA4|year=2008|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-135-6|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[low frequency]] bands (30 to 300 kHz), contacts between stations separated by more than 100 miles are often considered DX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=73 Amateur Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXFVAAAAYAAJ|year=1988|publisher=WGE Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[amateur radio]] operators and [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]], most traditional DX communication occurs on the [[high frequency|HF]] bands, where the [[ionosphere]] is used to refract the transmitted [[radio]] beam. The beam returns to the Earth's surface, and may then be reflected back into the ionosphere for a second bounce. Ionospheric refraction is generally only feasible for frequencies below about 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, and is highly dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the time of day, and the eleven-year [[sunspot]] cycle. It is also affected by [[solar flare|solar storms]] and some other solar events, which can alter the Earth's ionosphere by ejecting a shower of charged particles.

The angle of refraction places a minimum on the distance at which the refracted beam will first return to Earth. This distance increases with frequency. As a result, any station employing DX will be surrounded by an annular ''dead zone'' where they can't hear other stations or be heard by them.

This is the phenomenon that allows [[short wave]] radio reception to occur beyond the limits of line of sight. It is utilized by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts (hams), shortwave broadcast stations (such as [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]) and others, and is what allows one to hear AM (MW) stations from areas far from their location. It is one of the backups to failure of long distance communication by satellites, when their operation is affected by [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] storms from the sun.

For example, in clear [[ionosphere]] conditions, one can hear [[France Inter]] on 711 kHz, far into the UK and as far as [[Reading, Berkshire]]. It is also possible to hear [[Radio Australia]] from [[Melbourne]] as far away as [[Lansing, Michigan]], a distance of some 9835 miles (15,827 kilometers).

== DXing equipment ==
Radio equipment used in DXing ranges from inexpensive portable receivers to deluxe equipment costing thousands of dollars. Using just a simple AM radio, one can easily hear signals from the most powerful stations propagating hundreds of miles at night. Even inexpensive [[shortwave radio receiver]]s can receive signals emanating from several countries during any time of day.

Serious hobbyists use more elaborate receivers designed specifically for pulling in distant signals, and often build their own antennas designed for a specific frequency band. There is much discussion and debate in the hobby about the relative merits of lesser priced shortwave receivers vs. their multi-thousand dollar "big brother" radios. In general, a good desktop or "PC Radio" will be able to "hear" just about what a very expensive high-performance receiver can receive. The difference between the two types comes into play during difficult band or reception conditions. The expensive receiver will have more filtering options and usually better [[adjacent channel interference]] blocking, sometimes resulting in the difference of being able to receive or not receive a signal under poor conditions. Reception of [[international broadcasting]] seldom shows a noticeable difference between the two radios. [[Car audio|Car radios]] are also used for DXing the broadcast bands.

Another recent{{When|date=April 2011}} trend is for the hobbyist to employ multiple radios and antennas connected to a personal computer. Through advanced radio control software, the radios can be automatically ganged together, so that tuning one radio can tune all the others in the group. This DXing technique is sometimes referred to as [[diversity scheme|diversity]] reception and facilitates easy "A to B" comparison of different antennas and receivers for a given signal. For more details on "PC Radios" or computer controlled shortwave receivers see the discussion in [[Shortwave listening]].

Having a minimum of two [[Dipole antenna|Dipole antennas]] at right angles to each other (for example, one running North-South and one running East-West) can produce dramatically different reception patterns. These simple antennas can be made for a few dollars worth of wire and a couple of insulators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31700">The '''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems''' (EOLSS) is an [[encyclopedia]] on the science of [[sustainable development]] and conservation of [[life support system]]s on [[earth]]. The extensive publication is published under the patronage of [[UNESCO]].

==Overview==
In 1996, international [[scientists]], [[engineers]], and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mexico City]], [[Beijing]] and the [[Bahamas]] to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the [[biosphere]] in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]; [[Mathematical sciences]]; [[Biological]], [[physiological]] and [[health sciences]]; [[Biotechnology]]; [[Land use]], [[land cover]] and [[soil sciences]]; [[Tropical]] biology and conservation management; [[Social sciences]] and [[humanities]]; [[Physical sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Control systems]], [[robotics]] and [[automation]]; [[Chemical sciences]] engineering and technology resources; [[Water Science|Water sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Energy|Energy sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Environmental and [[ecological |ecological sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; [[Human resources]] policy, development and management; [[Natural resources]] policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); [[Desalination]] and water resources.

The way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as [[crowdsourcing]], where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of [[peer review]] and the joint [[Paris]]-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in [[Oxford]] as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as [[book]]s, [[e-books]] or scholarly [[subscription]]s.

The web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the [[United States]] and [[India]]. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the [[European Union]] who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eolss.net EOLSS, official website], retrieved on 2004-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Av0Yq6cVk EOLSS], Introduction on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives like [[Earth Day]] promote international cooperation on pro-environmental initiatives, or in other words – promote environmental globalization.]]
'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

[[Karl S.

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

Stearns|title=Globalization in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-25993-8|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Steven Yearley states that it was around that time that the [[environmental movement]] started to organize on the international scale focus on the global dimension of the issues (the first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 1970).&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA240|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters and opponents==
According to Grainger, environmental globalization (in the form of pro-environmental international initiatives) is usually supported by various [[non-governmental organization]]s&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

[[World Trade Organization]] has also been criticized as focused on economic globalization (liberalizing trade) over concerns of environmental protection, which are seen as impeding the trade.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA247|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-248"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA248|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yearley states that WTO should not be described as "anti-environmental", but its decisions have major impact on environment worldwide, and they are based primarily on economic concerns, with environmental concerns being given secondary weight.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-250"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA250|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The '''FIFA Women's World Rankings''' for [[Association football|football]] were introduced in 2003,&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; with the first rankings published in March of that year, as a follow-on to the existing [[FIFA World Rankings]] for men. They attempt to compare the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time.

==Specifics of the ranking system==
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women's international between [[France women's national football team|France]] and [[Netherlands women's national football team|the Netherlands]].
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In [[FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]] years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)

The first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the [[Elo rating system]] adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. Also any team that plays no matches for 18 months becomes unranked.

==Leaders==
&lt;div style="text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left: 1em"&gt;'''FIFA Women's&lt;br&gt; World Ranking leaders'''&lt;br&gt;{{FIFA Women's World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;
To date Germany and the United States have been the only two teams to have led the rankings. They have also held the top two spots in all but five releases, when Germany was ranked third: [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] was in second position in the first two rankings until Germany overtook them by winning the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] was ranked second in March and June 2009 until Germany won [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009|2009 Euro]] and rejoined the top two, and [[England women's national football team|England]] reached the #2 ranking in March 2018.

The United States holds the record for the longest period being ranked first: almost 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.

In the latest rankings, action from [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|Women's World Cup qualifying]] tournaments in [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] and [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship qualification|CONCACAF]], as well as the [[2018 Tournament of Nations]], caused movement throughout the rankings, though three of the top five did not change. The United States (#1), Germany (#2), and [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] (#5) retained their positions while England (#3) and [[France women's national football team|France]] (#4) swapped. [[Australia women's national football team|Australia]] rose to #6 on a 33-point gain, the largest gain among any of the top 50 teams, though [[Uganda women's national football team|Uganda]] earned the most points of any team with 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/news/y=2018/m=9/news=matildas-on-the-march-as-usa-stay-top.html|title=Matildas on the march as USA stay top|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=28 September 2018|website=fifa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking procedure==
The rankings are based on the following formulae:&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/r&amp;a-wwr/52/00/99/fs-590_06e_wwr-new.pdf| title=Fact Sheet, FIFA Women's World Ranking| accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft} = R_{bef} + K (S_{act} - S_{exp})&lt;/math&gt;'''

:'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp} =  \frac{1}{1 + 10^{-x/2}}&lt;/math&gt;'''
&lt;!-- This is not exactly stated in the reference, but that equation does not give sensible results, while this one matches the general Elo format --&gt;
:'''&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{R_{bef} - O_{bef} \pm H}{c}&lt;/math&gt;'''

Where
{| style="width:50%;"
|-
|width=4%|
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating after the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating before the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''||= '''&lt;math&gt;15 M&lt;/math&gt;''', the weighted importance of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{act}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The actual result of the match, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The expected result of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The scaled difference in rating points between the teams&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;O_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The opposing team's rating before the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The "home advantage" correction, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'''||= A scaling factor, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;

|'''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The "Match Importance Factor", ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|}

The average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for more than 18 months. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.

===Actual result of the match===
The main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.

If the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner.  For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 8–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%.  As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not "win by enough".

If the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%.  For example, a 0–0 draws earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

====Actual result table====
The following is from a non-winning perspective (loss or draw). The factor for the winning team adds up to 100.

===Neutral ground or Home vs. Away===
Historically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%.  To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its &lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt; inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation.  That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team's home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage.  This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result.

This also helps define the scaling constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, which has a value of 200.  In addition to a 100-point difference causing an expected result difference of 64%–36%, it also results in a 300-point difference causing expected results of 85%–15%.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

The '''FIH World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[field hockey]]. The teams of the member nations of [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), field hockey's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results. The rankings were introduced in October 2003.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite news|title=FIH to introduce world rankings|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/03/stories/2003090300141900.htm|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the rankings ==
The rankings were introduced to overcome the criticism of fixing when drawing the pools for each tournament. It also determines the quotas for tournaments such as the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and also the [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web|title=FIH World Ranking System|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/World%20Ranking/World%20Ranking%20Explanatory%20note.pdf|work=International Hockey Federation|publisher=FIH.ch|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
=== Overview ===
All of the FIH-recognised, including qualifying and continental tournaments for last four years are included in ranking points calculation. However, the past results will be deducted by the percentage set by the FIH as shown by the tabulated below.

{| class=wikitable

=== Continental championships ===
FIH had set the total allocated points for continental tournament. However, a different percentage was set to differ the standard of regional field hockey. Currently, only Europe had full 100% points allocation for all classification while the others had only several finishers with full points allocation. Africa is the sole continent with neither men's or women's tournament had full points allocation.

The '''FISA Improvements Act''' is a proposed act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.1631:|title=S.1631 -- FISA Improvements Act of 2013 (Placed on Calendar Senate - PCS)|publisher=Library of Congress (THOMAS)|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Chair of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]].  Prompted by the disclosure of [[National Security Agency|NSA]] surveillance by [[Edward Snowden]], it would establish the surveillance program as legal, but impose some limitations on availability of the data.  Opponents say the bill would codify warrantless access to many communications of American citizens for use by domestic law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer Ackerman in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance |title=Feinstein promotes bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless searches &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In the wake of the [[Edward Snowden|Snowden disclosures]], [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and many lawmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/obama-nsa-review-quest-public-trust-204947298--politics.html|title=For Obama, NSA review a quest for public trust|author=Julie Pace|date=2014-01-16|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/26/senate-change-nsa-program/2877899/|title=Lawmakers debate how to change NSA surveillance program|author=Kevin Johnson|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  believed that restoration of public trust would require legislative changes.  More than 20 bills have been written with the goal of reining in government surveillance powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/29/sensenbrenner_and_leahy_s_usa_freedom_act_seeks_to_curb_nsa_domestic_spying.html|title=U.S. Lawmakers Launch Assault on NSA Domestic Snooping|publisher=Slate|author=Ryan Gallagher|date=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein, long described as a staunch defender of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), announced that a "total review of all intelligence programs is necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131028/15370525042/feinstein-never-upset-about-spying-american-public-is-furious-about-nsa-spying-foreign-leaders.shtml |title=Five Reactions To Dianne Feinstein Finally Finding Something About The NSA To Get Angry About |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=61f9511e-5d1a-4bb8-92ff-a7eaa5becac0 |title=Feinstein Statement on Intelligence Collection of Foreign Leaders - Press Releases - News Room - United States Senator Dianne Feinstein |publisher=Feinstein.senate.gov |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130816/02462124204/ |title=How Could Dianne Feinstein Not Have Seen The Report Laying Out NSA Abuses? |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill was introduced by Feinstein on October 31, 2013.  Amendments were offered and rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131115/17113325262/senate-intelligence-committee-rejects-bunch-attempts-to-amend-dianne-feinsteins-fake-nsa-reform-bill.shtml |title=Senate Intelligence Committee Rejects A Bunch Of Attempts To Amend Dianne Feinstein's Fake NSA Reform Bill |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day it was introduced, the bill passed the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] by a vote of 11-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3aa4ed70-e80b-4c2b-afd6-dc2e5bc75a7b |title=Senate Intelligence Committee Approves FISA Improvements Act - Press Releases - News Room - United States Senator Dianne Feinstein |publisher=Feinstein.senate.gov |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee's report on the bill was published on November 12.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp11305RrJ&amp;r_n=sr119.113&amp;dbname=cp113&amp;sel=DOC&amp; |title=Committee Reports - 113th Congress (2013-2014) - Senate Report 113-119 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein issued a press release saying that the bill would impose restrictions on how data is collected, including prohibiting bulk collection of the content of communications, and place a limit of five years on retention of the data.  It would make unauthorized access to data obtained under the FISA orders punishable by ten years in prison.  The bill would make the [[FISA court]] require "reasonable articulable suspicion" of association with international terrorism before records are reviewed.  It also would set limits on the number of people with access to the data, and set limits on the number of "hops" (contact intermediaries) that can be searched.  It would require the NSA to make an annual report of the number of queries made and the number of FBI investigations or probable cause orders issued.  The bill would also require intelligence agencies to report violations of law to Congress, require a review once per by the Attorney General of collection procedures, and permit the FISA court to invite independent [[amicus curiae]] perspectives on cases.  It would  require [[Senate confirmation]] of appointments of the [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA director]] and [[NSA Inspector General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3aa4ed70-e80b-4c2b-afd6-dc2e5bc75a7b|title=Senate Intelligence Committee Approves FISA Improvements Act|date=2013-10-31|author=Dianne Feinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MSNBC]] reported that the bill "purports to ban the NSA's controversial bulk collection of communications records under Section 215 of the [[Patriot Act]]" but "basically allows the NSA to continue bulk collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Serwer |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/fisa-215-feinstein-nsa |title=Feinstein gives the NSA what it wants |publisher=MSNBC |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koebler |first=Jason |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-nsas-biggest-supporter-is-worried-about-drone-privacy-issues |title=The NSA's Biggest Supporter Is Worried About Drone Privacy Issues &amp;#124; Motherboard |publisher=Motherboard.vice.com |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feinstein defended data collection in her press release, saying that "The threats we face—from terrorism, proliferation and cyber attack, among others—are real, and they will continue. Intelligence is necessary to protect our national and economic security, as well as to stop attacks against our friends and allies around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/11/senate-intelligence-approves-new-surveillance-rules/71162/|title=Senate Intelligence Approves New Surveillance Rules|date=2013-11-01|publisher=The Wire|author=Brian Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

===Senate Intelligence Committee===
The Senate Intelligence Committee report recommended the bill, saying that the program was "an effective counterterrorism tool" and "was determined by the Department of Justice in two Administrations and by at least fifteen different judges serving on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to be lawful."  While noting that the committee had encountered inadvertent violations of the law, the majority reported "It remains the case that, through seven years of oversight of this metadata program under Section  215, the Committee has not identified a single case in which a government official engaged in a willful effort to circumvent  or violate Section 215 in the conduct of the bulk telephone metadata program."  The committee endorsed measures to codify and enhance privacy protections, saying these measures "could not have been enacted absent the declassification of lawful intelligence activities that were, until recently, properly classified, as to do so would have revealed the programs to our adversaries and thereby compromised their effectiveness."  However, it condemned the disclosures and said that the leaks "have not exposed government wrongdoing."&lt;ref name=committee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-report/113th-congress/senate-report/119/1|title=S. Rept. 113-119 - FISA Improvements Act of 2013|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a minority view attached to the report, Senators [[Ron Wyden]], [[Mark Udall]], and [[Martin Heinrich]] wrote "this bill would codify the government's authority to collect the phone records of huge numbers of law-abiding Americans, and also to conduct warrantless searches for individual Americans' phone calls and emails. We respectfully but firmly disagree with this approach."  Feinstein's response in the report was that the bill "does not provide any new legislative authority with which the government may acquire call records or any other information under Section 215--in fact, it narrows the existing authority for it."&lt;ref name=committee /&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) urged opposition, calling the bill a "dream come true for the NSA".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-seurity-technology-and-liberty/sen-dianne-feinsteins-nsa-reforms-bad-privacy-bad |accessdate=January 23, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the bill a "fake fix" that would "permanently entrench" current surveillance practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/11/13/62864.htm|title=Senate's Bill Is a 'Fake Fix' to Domestic Spying|author=Jack Bouboushian|publisher=Courthouse News Service|date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/sen-feinsteins-nsa-bill-will-codify-and-extend-mass-surveillance|title=Sen.

One area of concern raised by ''[[The Guardian]]'', crediting blogger [[Marcy Wheeler]], regards a "backdoor search provision" which could allow domestic U.S. law enforcement agencies warrantless access to the data.  A FISA court document declassified in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/162016974-FISA-court-opinion-with-exemptions.pdf|title=[redacted] Memorandum Opinion|publisher=United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|date=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a leak by [[Edward Snowden]] previously published by the newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls|title=NSA loophole allows warrantless search for US citizens' emails and phone calls|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013-08-09|author1=James Ball |author2=Spencer Ackerman }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that generally searches of the database for "[[US person|U. S. Persons]]" was not permitted, but contained a provision that:
:"While the FAA 702 minimization procedures approved on 3 October 2011 now allow for use of certain United States person names and identifiers as query terms when reviewing collected FAA 702 data, analysts may NOT/NOT [not repeat not] implement any USP [US persons] queries until an effective oversight process has been developed by NSA and agreed to by DOJ/ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence]."
According to ''The Guardian'', Section 6 of the Act "blesses" such a procedure, permitting intelligence agencies to search "the contents of communications" collected overseas for U.S. persons provided that the purpose pertained to "foreign intelligence information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance|title=Feinstein promotes bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless searches|publisher=The Guardian|author=Spencer Ackerman|date=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The provision was also criticized by Senator [[Ron Wyden]], who said that the bill "would give intelligence agencies wide latitude to conduct warrantless searches for American phone calls and emails", instead supporting the [[USA Freedom Act]] by Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] and [[F. James Sensenbrenner]] that would require a search warrant to obtain the information.  Sensenbrenner called Feinstein's bill an effort "for the first time in our country's history to allow unrestrained spying on the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/177248/these-lawmakers-have-plan-rein-nsa-spying|title=These Lawmakers Have a Plan to Rein In NSA Spying |author=Robert Scheer|publisher=The Nation|date=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

The '''German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal''' (official title: ''1. Untersuchungsausschuss „NSA“'') was started on March 20, 2014, by the [[German Parliament]] in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany in the light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]].
The Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.&lt;ref&gt;http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/008/1800843.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutscher Bundestag]]: [http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss 1. Untersuchungsausschuss („NSA“)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The committee is formed by eight members of the German Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss/mitglieder/262992 Mitglieder des NSA-Untersuchungsausschusses], bundestag.de, accessed July 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentarian of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] [[Clemens Binninger]] was head of the committee but stepped down after six days. In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2014/50515028_kw15_binninger/216908|title=Deutscher Bundestag - NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: Binninger tritt vom Ausschussvorsitz zurück|author=Karl Otto Sattler|date=9 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-04/nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-binninger-ruecktritt NSA-Ausschussvorsitzender geht im Streit], Zeit.de, April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Sensburg]] (CDU) succeeded him.

== Witnesses ==

=== Discussion about the witness Snowden ===
On May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014]. Website FAZ, accessed September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-spaehaffaere-opposition-verklagt-merkel-wegen-snowden-a-994029.html|title=NSA Sphaffre: Opposition verklagt Merkel wegen Snowden  - SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=28 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony of Binney and Drake ===
On July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], who had become a whistleblower after the [[9/11|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-9-11-hat-alles-veraendert.aeedf44b-6825-4583-a740-0c20c0bd723a.html|title=NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: 9/11  hat alles verändert - Politik - Stuttgarter Zeitung|author=Stuttgarter Zeitung|location=Stuttgart, Germany|date=3 July 2014|work=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur], Der Spiegel, July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Former NSA employee [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst „ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA“], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND untersttzte Drohnenkrieg der USA|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed testimony of Greenwald ===
The US journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a "ritual" that "shall seem like an investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glenn-greenwald-sagt-zeugenvernehmung-vor-nsa-ausschuss-ab-a-984030.html|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Zeugenvernehmung vor NSA-Ausschuss ab|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=1 August 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/glenn-greenwald-sagt-untersuchungsausschuss-ab-ritual-das-die-illusion-einer-untersuchung-erwecken-soll|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Untersuchungsausschuss ab: "Ritual, das die Illusion einer Untersuchung erwecken soll"|work=netzpolitik.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Eikonal selectors==
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" from the NSA − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spying on the committee ==
On July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neue-medienberichte-festgenommener-bnd-mann-spionierte-auch-fuer-die-cia-1.2032849 Medien: Festgenommener BND-Mann spionierte für CIA], Süddeutsche.de, July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the US ambassador [[John B.

It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Festnahme-BND-Mitarbeiter-soll-NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss-ausspioniert-haben-2249652.html|title=Festnahme: BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ausspioniert haben|date=4 July 2014|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-verfassungsschutz-wollte-agenten-mit-us-hilfe-enttarnen-a-979416.html|title=BND: Verfassungsschutz wollte Agenten mit US-Hilfe enttarnen|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=5 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of [[Roderich Kiesewetter]], representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/ulm/kiesewetter-offenbar-abgehoert/-/id=1612/did=13735756/nid=1612/1hqz7ou/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document leaks ==
In the months following May 2015, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the Austrian parliament for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], disclosed several documents and transcripts related to [[operation Eikonal]], in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of [[Deutsche Telekom]] in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2015/11/unnoticed-leak-answers-and-raises.html Unnoticed leak answers and raises questions about operation Eikonal], November 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.format.at/articles/1430/930/376970/spionage-peter-pilz-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss|title=Spionage: Peter Pilz fordert einen NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|work=format.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000. Discours de la ministre sur les priorite´s de la pre´sidence franc¸aise dans le domaine de l’environnement devant la commission environnement—consommation—sante´du parlement europe´en, 6 juillet 2000, Strasbourg’, French Presidency of the EU [online] Available at: www.presidence-europe.fr [Accessed 03 November 2011]. and Kohl, H. et al., 1997. Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greenwich Time Signal pips.png|thumb|350px|Graph of the six pips]]

The '''Greenwich Time Signal''' ('''GTS'''), popularly known as '''the pips''', is a series of six short tones broadcast at one-second intervals by many [[BBC Radio]] [[List of BBC radio stations|stations]]. The pips were introduced in 1924 and have been generated by the BBC since 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=McIlroy |title=Network Radio: New Time and Frequency distribution system |url=http://www.bbceng.info/Eng_Inf/EngInf_40.pdf#page=5 |format=pdf |journal=Eng Inf |date=Spring 1990 |issue=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark the precise start of each hour. Their utility in [[calibration]] is diminishing as digital broadcasting entails time lags.

==Structure==

{{Listen|filename=Gts_ (bbc)_pips.ogg|title=Greenwich Time Signal|description=The first five pips and 1 beep}}

There are six pips (short beeps) in total, which occur on each of the 5&amp;nbsp;seconds leading up to the hour and on the hour itself. Each pip is a 1 [[SI prefix|k]][[Hertz|Hz]] tone (about halfway between musical [[Scientific pitch notation#Table of note frequencies|B5 and C6]]) the first five of which last a tenth of a second each, while the final pip lasts half a second. The actual moment when the hour changes – the "on-time marker" – is at the very beginning of the last pip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the time?|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/what%27s-the-time|work=Astronomy &amp; Time|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055748/http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/what%27s-the-time|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[leap second]] occurs (exactly one second before midnight [[UTC]]), it is indicated by a seventh pip. In this case the first pip occurs at 23:59:55 (as usual) and there is a sixth short pip at 23:59:60 (the leap second) followed by the long pip at 00:00:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leap second: Keeper of the pips |website=BBC News |date=30 December 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7791709.stm |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility of an extra pip for the leap second thus justifies the final pip being longer than the others, so that it is always clear which pip is on the hour.  Before leap seconds were conceived, the final pip was the same length as the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The comforting tone of the hourly radio pips |author= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26052087 |website=BBC News (Magazine Monitor) |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although "negative" leap seconds can also be used to make the year shorter, this has never happened in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leap years and leap seconds|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/leap-years|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055800/http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/leap-years|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjusting after a ‘long’ weekend at the Royal Observatory – Precision clocks and the leap second|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/collections/2012/07/06/adjusting/|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055748/http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/collections/2012/07/06/adjusting/|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although normally broadcast only on the hour by BBC domestic radio, BBC World Service use the signal at other times as well. The signal is generated at each quarter-hour and has on occasion been broadcast in error.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Up to 1972 the pips were of equal length and confusion arose as to which was the final pip, hence the last pip was of extended length.

==Usage==
The pips are available to BBC radio stations every 15 minutes but except in rare cases, they are only broadcast on the hour, usually before news bulletins or news programmes. On [[BBC Radio 4]], the pips are broadcast every hour except at 18:00 and 00:00 and at 22:00 on Sundays (at the start of the Westminster Hour) when they are replaced by the [[Westminster chime]]s of [[Big Ben]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. No time signal is broadcast at 15:00 on Saturdays and at 10:00 and 11:00 on Sundays.   This is caused by the scheduling of the afternoon play on Saturday and the omnibus edition of ''[[The Archers]]'' on Sunday. On [[BBC Radio 2]], the pips are used at 07:00, 08:00, 17:00 and 19:00 on weekdays, at 07:00 and 08:00 on Saturdays and at 08:00 and 09:00 on Sundays.

The pips were used on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] during ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' at 06:30 just after the news, 09:00 as part of the Tedious Link feature, 10&amp;nbsp;am (at the end of the show) and often before ''[[Newsbeat]]''. As most stations only air the pips on the hour, ''The Chris Moyles Show'' was the only show where the pips were broadcast on the half-hour. [[Chris Moyles]] continues to use the pips at the beginning of his show on [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Radio X]]. [[Zane Lowe]]'s Masterpieces, the playing of an album in its entirety, is begun with pips, and they also feature at 19:00 on Fridays to signify the start of the weekend and at 16:00 on Sundays to mark the start of ''[[The Official Chart|The Official Chart Show]]''. ''[[Devin Griffin|The Weekend Breakfast Show with Dev]]'' begins with the pips at 06:00, and they sometimes feature on the hour at other points during the show, and ''[[Gemma Cairney]]'s Early Breakfast Show'' begins with the pips. [[Devin Griffin|Dev's]] previous ''Early Breakfast Show'' also featured the pips at the beginning, and on the half-hour/hour at other points, particularly at 06:00 before or after the "I'm Here All Week" track. The pips are also used at 19:00 on Saturday evenings at the start of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1's]] 12-hour simulcast with digital station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]].

[[BBC Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio Five Live]] do not currently feature the Greenwich Time Signal in their scheduled programming.

The [[BBC World Service]] broadcasts the pips every hour.

Pips can also be heard on many [[BBC Local Radio]] stations although their use is up to the discretion of individual stations. A rare quarter-hour Greenwich Time Signal can be heard at 05:15 weekdays on Wally Webb's programme on six BBC Local Radio stations in the east of England, as part of his "sychronised cup of tea" feature.

In 1999, pip-like sounds were incorporated into the themes written by composer [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]] to introduce [[BBC News|BBC Television News]] programmes. They are still used today on [[BBC One]], [[BBC World News]] and [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]].

The BBC does not allow the pips to be broadcast except as a time signal. Radio plays and comedies which have fictional news programmes use various methods to avoid playing the full six pips, ranging from simply fading in the pips to a version played on ''[[On the Hour]]'' in which the sound was made into a small tune between the pips. ''[[The News Quiz]]'' also featured a special Christmas pantomime edition where the pips went missing, and the problem was avoided there by only playing individual pips and not the whole set. The 2012 project ''Radio Reunited'', however, did use the pips not as a time signal, but simply to commemorate 90 years of BBC Radio.

==Accuracy==
The pips for national radio stations and some local radio stations are timed relative to [[UTC]], from an [[atomic clock]] in the basement of [[Broadcasting House]] synchronised with the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]]'s [[Time from NPL]] and [[GPS]]. On other stations, the pips are generated locally from a [[GPS]]-synchronised clock.

The BBC compensates for the time delay in both broadcasting and receiving equipment, as well as the time for the actual transmission. The pips are timed so that they are accurately received on [[long wave]] as far as {{convert|160|km|-1}} from the [[Droitwich AM transmitter]], which is the distance to [[Central London]].

As a pre-[[IRIG timecode|IRIG]] and pre-[[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] time transfer and transmission system, the pips have been a great technological success. In modern times, however, time can be transferred to systems with CPUs and operating systems by using BCD or some Unix Time variant.

Newer digital broadcasting methods have introduced even greater problems for the accuracy of use of the pips. On digital platforms such as [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], [[digital audio broadcasting|DAB]], satellite and the [[internet]], the pips—although ''generated'' accurately—are not ''heard'' by the listener exactly on the hour. The [[codec|encoding and decoding]] of the digital signal causes a delay, of usually between 2 and 8&amp;nbsp;seconds. In the case of satellite broadcasting, the [[Time of arrival|travel time]] of the signal to and from the satellite adds about another 0.25&amp;nbsp;seconds.

==History==
[[File:Greenwich Time Signal1970.jpg|thumb|right|The machine used to generate the pips in 1970]]
The pips have been broadcast daily since 5 February 1924,&lt;ref name="bbchist"&gt;{{citation
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/271319.stm
|publisher=[[BBC News]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and were the idea of the [[Astronomer Royal]], Sir [[Frank Watson Dyson]], and the head of the BBC, [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]. The pips were originally controlled by two mechanical clocks located in the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] that had electrical contacts attached to their [[pendulum|pendula]]. Two clocks were used in case of a breakdown of one. These sent a signal each second to the BBC, which converted them to the audible oscillatory tone broadcast.&lt;ref name="bbchist"/&gt;

The Royal Greenwich Observatory moved to [[Herstmonceux Castle]] in 1957 and the GTS equipment followed a few years later in the form of an electronic clock. Reliability was improved by renting two lines for the service between Herstmonceux and the BBC, with a changeover between the two at [[Broadcasting House]] if the main line became disconnected.

The tone sent on the lines was inverted: the signal sent to the BBC was a steady 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone when no pip was required, and no tone when a pip should be sounded. This let faults on the line be detected immediately by automated monitoring for loss of audio.

The Greenwich Time Signal was the first sound heard in the handover to the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]] during the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Beijing 2008 Olympics closing ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baton Passed to London for 2012 |first=Peter | last=Simpson |url=http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=3411&amp;section=latestnews |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322024520/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=3411&amp;section=latestnews |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pips were also broadcast by the [[BBC Television Service]], but this practice was discontinued by the 1960s.

To celebrate the 90th birthday of the pips on 5 February 2014, the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme broadcast a sequence that included a re-working of the Happy Birthday melody using the GTS as its base sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rqqkn|last=Lister|first=Charles|title=The 'time pips' at 90|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crashing the pips==
The [[BBC]] discourages any other sound being broadcast at the same time as the pips; doing so is commonly known as 'crashing the pips'. This was most often referred to on [[Terry Wogan]]'s Radio 2 Breakfast show, although usually only in jest since the actual event happened rarely.&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pip, pip! Woman of Today is gone tomorrow |author=Tom Leonard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386296/Pip-pip-Woman-of-Today-is-gone-tomorrow.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different BBC Radio stations approach this issue differently. Both BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 generally take a more laid-back approach with the pips, usually playing them over the closing seconds of a currently playing song or a jingle 'bed' (background music from a jingle), followed by their respective news jingles. Many BBC local radio stations also play the pips over the station's jingle. BBC Radio 4 is stricter. It is an almost entirely speech-based network; incidents at the end of the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme regularly cause listeners' complaints.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a contribution to [[Comic Relief]]'s 2005 Red Nose Day, the BBC developed a "pips" ring-tone which can be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/rednose_ringtones_20050307.shtml |title=The Radio 4 Pips – How you download the pips |date=March 2005 |work=[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today Programme]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Bailey]]'s BBC Rave includes the [[BBC News (TV channel)#Countdown sequence|BBC News theme]], which incorporates a variant of the pips (though not actually broadcast exactly on the hour). The footage can be seen on his DVD ''Part Troll''.

In the late 1980s Radio 1 featured the pips played over a station [[jingle]] during [[Jackie Brambles|Jakki Brambles]]' early show and [[Simon Mayo]]'s breakfast show. This was not strictly crashing the pips as they were not intended to be, or mistaken for, an accurate time signal.

==Technical problems==
At 8 am on 17 September 2008, to the surprise of [[John Humphrys]], the day's main presenter on the ''Today'' programme, and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], who was standing in for Terry Wogan on Radio 2, the pips went adrift by 6&amp;nbsp;seconds, and broadcast seven pips rather than six. This was traced to a problem with the pip generator, which was 'repaired' by switching it off and on again.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|accessdate=2009-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Humphrys' surprise was probably because of his deliberate avoidance of crashing the pips with the help of an accurate clock in the studio.

A sudden total failure in the generation of the audio pulses that constitute the pips was experienced on 31 May 2011 and silence was unexpectedly broadcast in place of the 17:00 signal. The problem was traced to the power supply of the equipment which converts the signal from the atomic clocks into an audible signal.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2011/06/what_happened_to_the_radio_4_p.html |title= What happened to the Radio 4 pips? |author= Denis Nowlan |date= 1 June 2011 |work= Radio 4 and 4 Extra Blog |publisher= BBC |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst repairs were underway the BBC elected to broadcast a "dignified silence" in place of the pips at 19:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Radio 4's pips die |author= Harry Wallop |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8548683/Radio-4s-pips-die.html |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 31 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19:45 the same day the power supply was repaired&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; and the 20:00 pips were broadcast as normal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/05/bbc-radio-4-reports-on-pips-failure/ "The Pips return from a 3&amp;nbsp;hour break" ''Radio Today'' 31 May 2011] Retrieved 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many radio broadcasters around the world use the Greenwich Time Signal as a means to mark the start of the hour. The pips are used in both domestic and international commercial and public broadcasting. Many radio stations use six tones similar to those used by the BBC World Service; some shorten it to five, four, or three tones.

* [[Argentina]] – all news/talk stations (Radio Nacional, Radio Mitre, Radio Continental, Radio 10, Cadena 3, etc.) air the six pips similar to the BBC every hour, and 3 pips for every half-hour similar to Catalonia. Also some online radios like Comucosas Radio, plays the pips
* [[Australia]] – pips are used on [[ABC Radio National]] and [[ABC Local Radio]] at the top of every hour, as well as on [[Fairfax Media]] talkback stations- [[2UE]], [[3AW]], [[4BC]] and [[6PR]]. In Australia, the news pips are closer to 735Hz and each of the six pips lasts for half a second. After each pip, there is half a second of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=ABC Radio incoming News sound|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-lsc29hkww|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazil]] - Some news stations, like the national station [[Radio Bandeirantes]], and the regional stations [[Radio Guaíba]] and [[Radio Gaúcha]] broadcasts a similar time signal every 15 minutes. In Radio Bandeirantes, there is 5-pips signal (called as "fifth signal"). In Radio Gaúcha, is used a 4-pips signal every 15 minutes. 
* [[Canada]] – the [[National Research Council Time Signal]] is broadcast daily on [[Ici Radio-Canada Première]] at 12:00 EST/EDT and on [[CBC Radio One]] at 13:00 EST/EDT. It is Canada's longest running radio feature and has been broadcast every day since 5 November 1939.
* [[China]] – [[China National Radio]] and all local radio stations use a similar 6-pip time signal on the hour. 5 short lower-pitched (0.25 s, 800&amp;nbsp;Hz) pips are played to count down the final 5 seconds of the old hour, and a longer, higher-pitched (0.5 s, 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz) pip is played to mark the beginning of the new hour.
* [[Finland]] – on [[YLE]]'s radio services the pips are broadcast on the hour.
* [[France]] – the station [[France Inter]] broadcasts four very short pips every hour, which are almost invariably crashed. The last pip, which is as long as the other ones, marks the top of the hour. Some local stations of the [[France Bleu]] network also air four pips that are a little longer than Inter's.
* [[Germany]] – [[Deutschlandfunk]] broadcasts three beeps every hour, the last one being longer than the others; between 05:00 and 18:00 on weekdays they are broadcast every half-hour and sometimes omitted at 21:00 when there is no news programme scheduled. The sister station, Deutschlandfunk Kultur omitted Pips altogether with their rebrand in 2017.
* [[Hong Kong]] – a six-pip time signal is used on [[RTHK]]'s radio channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Synchronization with Hong Kong Time System|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/gts/time/Clocksyn.htm|website=[[Hong Kong Observatory]]|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signals, which are provided by the [[Hong Kong Observatory]], are broadcast every half-hour during the day and on the hour at night, immediately before the news headline reports.
* [[Hungary]] – the national radio channel Kossuth broadcasts five stereophonic pips at the top of every hour, the fifth being longer than the others.
* [[India]] – six pips are used by [[All India Radio]] before starting its Delhi news bulletins.
* [[Ireland]] – six pips are broadcast before news bulletins at 07:00, 13:00 and 24:00 on [[RTÉ Radio 1]].
* [[Israel]] –  On Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation hourly radio news, 5 tones (part of a recording of Kol Israel's original beeps) play counting down to the hour. Right as the hour starts, a jingle starts playing, the end of which includes the IPBC's [[Sound trademark|sonic ident]] and an acapella singing the name of the broadcaster "Kan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z70Y_d2h25I|title=תאגיד השידור הציבורי "כאן"- אותות הפתיחה והסיום של החדשות ברדיו|publisher=YouTube|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This jingle replaced the original 6 tones that played on [[Kol Israel]]'s hourly newscasts - six tones, with the sixth tone being longer. As of 2017 (when public broadcaster [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] got shut down and replaced by the IPBC or "[[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|Kan]]"), the intro got changed and added a jingle.
* [[Italy]] – The National Italian Radio "Rai" uses 6 tones to signal exact time in all its stations. They differ in the timing: Rai Radio 1 tells the hour. Rai Radio 2 tells on the half hour (at 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 10:30, 12:30, 13:30, 17:30, 19:30, 21:30 and 23:30). Rai Radio 3 signals the 45 minute of selected hours (at 6:45, 8:45, 13:45 and 18:45) All the signals come from the Istituto Metrologico di Torino, the national study centre for measure and time. Also on Rai Radio 2 and Rai Radio 3 tells at 6 o'clock on start the new day.
* [[Japan]] – [[NHK|NHK Television]] formerly used three short pips played at :57 to :59 of the clock ident and a longer three-second pip from :00 to :03 just before the start of news programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTXl_zR88OE|title=時報(TV Clock)|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXGknxAjgj0|title=NHK　1987年　ニュースOP集|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer three-second pip can however be crashed shortly after the :00 mark on certain special events or if there was time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWi7QS_vOps|title=昭和から平成への変わり目|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malaysia]] – [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]] radio stations use the pips hourly before the news broadcast but only the top-of-the-hour pip is sounded. Until late 2012, the time signal is simply a short pip on the 59th second before the hour and a longer pip on the top of the hour. In a news report in [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] on 1 January 1982, the pips were used to sound similar to the BBC's.
* [[Netherlands]] – only three pips (two pips and one beep) were used from 1991 to 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1315658/2007/08/04/De-rode-lopers-van-de-radio.dhtml De rode lopers van de radio] – book review in [[Trouw]] (4 August 2007, in Dutch). &lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast of the pips has stopped with the last transmission at 7:00 on 2 October 2018.
* [[New Zealand]] – the equivalent of BBC Radio 4, [[Radio New Zealand National]], plays the six pips at the top of every hour.
* [[North Korea]] – the pips are heard on [[Voice of Korea]] before its startup at 17:00.
* [[Poland]] – Polish radio tells 5 pips and 1 beep before the hour. Not broadcasting in Polskie Radio Jedynka on Every Sunday's, 3 May (Polish Constitution Day), 15 August (Polish Armed Forces Day) and 11 November (Polish Independence Day) at 9:00 in the morning, because broadcasting The Holly Mass.
* [[Russia]] - Russia's state television [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] broadcasts 6 tones (at the end of a short melody) before newscasts and [[Vremya]] (the primetime news program).
* [[Sindh]] The [[Sindhi language]] news channel [[KTN News]] plays 5 pips at the start of each news hour.
* [[Spain]] – the signal is broadcast by almost all radio stations, even by music stations, but depends on the frequency: music stations usually use pips on the hour, but most of the non-musical stations broadcast the signal every 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. Los [[40 Principales]], the most important music radio in Spain, broadcast a different version of GTS: two first pips sound and then a music is added on the background, using the rhythm to create the corporative jingle of the radio. This station in particular uses only 4 pips, typically the two last using two different frequencies (resulting in a modern rhythm). Other musical radios like [[Máxima FM]] and [[M80 Radio]], both owned by [[PRISA]], and Europa FM use a similar effect.
** [[Catalonia]], Spain – dance music station Flaix FM and Hot AC station Ràdio Flaixbac, both owned by the same media group, broadcast every half-hour a very short sequence of two very short tones followed by a longer one, the whole lasting not more than one and a half seconds. Els 40 Principals, the Catalan edition of Spanish radio Los [[40 Principales]], use the same jingle, using a mix of GTS and corporative music.
* [[Sri Lanka]] – [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] uses GTS pips on their radio channels to mark the start of the hour at each main newscast just after playing the news theme music. Other stations do not use pips.
* [[Switzerland]] – The first channel of the Swiss radio used to play three short pips, the third being higher than the others. It seems to have disappeared now.
* [[United States]] – the pips can be heard on the [[Middlebury College]] radio station [[WRMC]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  [[CBS News Radio]] broadcasts a single tone on the hour before the hourly news broadcast.
* former [[Yugoslavia]] – JRT broadcast the six pips before the news (on the hour) on radio as well as on television, before the start of the ''TV Dnevnik'' at 8:00 pm. The broadcast on TV was stopped in 1974 because the ''TV Dnevnik'' was moved to its current term at the bottom of the hour (7:30 pm).

The [[prehistory of the Americas]] ([[North America|North]], [[South America|South]], and [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]]) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an [[Ice Age]]. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the "[[Old World]]" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492.

The ancestors of today's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indigenous peoples]] were the [[Paleo-Indians]]; they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the [[Americas]] via [[Beringia]], the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the [[Bering Strait]]. Small [[lithic stage]] peoples followed [[megafauna]] like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname "big-game hunters." Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.

Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as [[Iroquois]] on North America and [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] of South America. These cultures later developed into [[civilization]]s. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} advanced or civilized include [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], [[Cahokia]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Toltec]], [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Chimor]], [[Mixtec]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]], [[Puebloan]], [[Totonac]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Huastec people]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Izapa]], [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and the [[Inca]].{{Human history}}After the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and later [[British Empire|English]], [[French Colonial Empire|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day [[Southwestern United States]], [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day [[Brazil]] while England established colonies on the [[Thirteen Colonies|Eastern coast of the United States]], as well as the [[Northwestern United States|North Pacific coast]] and in most of [[Canada]]. France settled in [[Quebec]] and other parts of Eastern [[Canada]] and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.

European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (376 million speakers), [[English language|English]] (348 million) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when [[Brazil]] and the larger [[Hispanic America]]n nations declared independence. The [[United States]] obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as [[Guyana]] obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and [[French Guiana]] remain part of a European power to this day.

&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the [[Beringia|Beringia land bridge]] between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 – 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the [[Quaternary glaciation]].&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|first1=Drs.

New studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought"&lt;ref name=Raghavan&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature12736 |last1= Raghavan |first1= Maanasa |author2=Pontus Skoglund, Kelly E.

===Lithic stage (before 8000 BCE)===
[[File:Obsidiana.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Obsidian]] projectile point from Puerta Parada, [[Guatemala]]]]

The [[Lithic stage]] or ''[[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]]'', is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the [[Late Pleistocene]] epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of "[[Lithic flake]]d" stone tools. [[Stone tool]]s, particularly [[projectile point]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the [[Americas]]. [[Lithic reduction]] stone tools are used by [[archaeologists]] and [[anthropologist]]s to classify cultural periods.

===Archaic stage (8000 BCE – 1000 BCE)===
{{see also|Pre-Columbian era|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}
Several thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle [[Archaic stage|Archaic period]] around 6000 BCE. Particular [[archaeological culture]]s can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.

In the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the [[Norte Chico civilization]], also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradle of civilization|five sites]] where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican [[Olmec]] civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under [[Narmer]] and the emergence of the first [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].

Monumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.

Ongoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.

The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, [[Michael E. Moseley]] contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed "maritime foundation of Andean Civilization" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).

While earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]] at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added [[avocado]], [[Canna (plant)|achira]], and [[corn]] (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.&lt;ref name=HaasPNAS2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Haas | first1= Jonathan | author2= Winifred Creamer, Luis Huamán Mesía, David Goldstein, Karl Reinhard, and Cindy Vergel Rodríguez | year = 2013 | title = Evidence for maize (Zea mays) in the Late Archaic (3000–1800 B.C.) in the Norte Chico region of Peru |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 13 |pages = 4945–4949 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1219425110 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1219425110 |accessdate = 2013-11-20 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences of the United States |quote=New data drawn from coprolites, pollen records, and stone tool residues, combined with 126 radiocarbon dates, demonstrate that maize was widely grown, intensively processed, and constituted a primary component of the diet throughout the period from 3000 to 1800 B.C. | pmid=23440194 | pmc=3612639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotton]] was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish."

In the 2005 book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date "sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at [[Huaricanga]] in the (inland) Fortaleza area.

The Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.

After the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: [[Chavín culture|Chavin]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Quitus]], [[Cañari]]s, [[Chimu]], [[Pachacamac]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Inca]] in the Central [[Andes]] (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in Colombia ; [[Taínos]] in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Española) and part of Caribbean; and the [[Olmec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], [[Aztec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).

The [[Olmec]] civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|six sites]] around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.

Some elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The [[Maize#Origin|domestication of maize]] is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/I/20035654.html |title=Agriculture's origin may be hidden in 'invisible' clues |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.

The Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.

Cities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec empire]]. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, [[Cahokia]], located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.

These civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding [[maize]] (corn) from having ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to perhaps 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm in length. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[chocolate]] are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the [[Andes]]. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley after introduction from [[Mexico]]. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]].

When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [[Veto|veto power]]. The Onondaga were the "[[firekeeper]]s", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Elizabeth Tooker, an [[anthropologist]], has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, or in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century [[Beaver Wars]].&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |publisher=Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture |accessdate=2010-11-29 |last=Burns |first=LF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102050914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The Osage warred with [[Caddo]]-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

;Chichimeca
{{main|Chichimeca}}

Chichimeca was the name that the [[Aztec|Mexica]] (Aztecs) generically applied to a wide range of semi-[[nomad]]ic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day [[Mexico]], and carried the same sense as the European term "[[barbarian]]". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples of northern Mexico.

====Mesoamerica====
{{main|Mesoamerica}}

;Zapotec
The [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]].

;Olmec
The [[Olmec]] civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in [[Mesoamerica]] and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.

;Purepecha
The [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] civilization emerged around 1000 CE in [[Mesoamerica]] . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of [[Michoacán]]. Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.

;Maya
{{main|History of the Maya civilization}}
[[Maya civilization|Maya]] history spans 3,000 years. The [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya]] may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.

;Toltec
The [[Toltec]] were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.

;Teotihuacan
[[Teotihuacan]] (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.

;Aztec
The [[Aztec]] having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.

====South America====
[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inca Quipu. [[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection.]]]]
{{main|Pre-Columbian South America}}

;Norte Chico
The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico]] region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The [[Quipu]], a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.

;Chavín
The [[Chavín]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.

;[[Inca]]
Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.
Known as ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[Trepanning|trepanation]] of the skull in Inca civilization.

Around 1000, the [[Vikings]] established a short-lived settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.

Spain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492; it quickly led to extensive [[European colonization of the Americas]]. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.

===Colonial period===
{{see also|Colonial history of the United States|Former colonies and territories in Canada}}
15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:
*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] (1492)
*[[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535 to 1821)
*[[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542–1824)
*[[Spanish Main]]
*[[Spanish West Indies]]
*[[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]
*[[British America]] / [[Thirteen Colonies]] (1497/1584/1607 to 1776/20th century)
*[[Danish West Indies]]
*[[New Netherland]]
*[[New France]]
*[[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]
*[[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]] (1499 to 1822)
*[[Colonial Brazil]] (1500 to 1815)

===Decolonization===
{{details|Decolonization of the Americas}}
The formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] lasted through the period of the [[Siege of Yorktown]] — its last major campaign — in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]].
 
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José de San Martín]], among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]]. (See [[Latin American integration]].) In the Portuguese colony [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.

===Effects of slavery===

Slavery has had a significant role in the economic development of the [[New World]] after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. The [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], and [[sugar cane]] harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries.

[[File:New Names Canadian WW1 recruiting poster.jpg|thumb|A Canadian World War I recruiting poster - (1914–1918)]]

As a part of the [[British Empire]], Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] attacks at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]]. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in [[conscription]], despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of [[French Canadians]]. In the ensuing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], riots broke out on the streets of [[Montreal]]. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]].

The United States stayed out of the conflict [[American entry into World War I|until 1917]], when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] that shaped [[interwar]] Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.

{{further|Roaring Twenties|Great Depression|Cristero War}}

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] combined with [[dust bowl|drought]] ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and [[Great Depression in Canada|Canada]]. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].

{{further|Military history of Canada during World War II|Military history of the United States during World War II|United States home front during World War II|SS Potrero del Llano|Faja de Oro|Escuadrón 201}}

Once again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a "[[superpower]]".

{{further|History of the United States (1945–64)|History of Canada (1945–60)|Civil rights movement}}

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the emergence of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as ''"El Milagro Mexicano"'' (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of [[decolonization]], while on the largest island the [[Cuban Revolution]] introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.

{{further|History of the United States (1964–80)|History of Canada (1960–81)}}

The [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S. ended [[Jim Crow]] and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant [[New Deal coalition]] collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the [[Vietnam War]], and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed]]. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.

{{further|History of the United States (1980–91)|History of Canada (1982–92)}}

Canada's [[Brian Mulroney]] not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] in January 1989. Mexican presidents [[Miguel de la Madrid]], in the early 1980s and [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of [[privatization]] and [[regulation]] to stimulate the economy.

{{further|History of the United States (1991–present)|History of Canada (1992–present)}}

The end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, [[Vicente Fox]] became the first non-[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the [[9/11]] attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in [[Afghanistan]], which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], however.

In the U.S. the [[Reagan Era]] of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the [[Late-2000s recession]] with prolonged unemployment.

Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856&amp;ndash;1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

In 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] ("CACM"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 "[[Football War]]" between El Salvador and Honduras. A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

===South America===
{{see also|History of South America}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States [[Cold War]] doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and a leftist president in Argentina and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the [[Union of South American Nations]], South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">'''Ideoscape''' is a term used to describe one of [[Arjun Appadurai]]’s five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of [[ethnoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[Financescape|financescapes]], and '''ideoscapes'''. The suffix -''scape'' denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. Because cultural exchange and transactions have typically been restricted in the past due to geographical and economical aspects, Appadurai’s five dimensions give the opportunity for cultural transactions to occur. '''Ideoscapes''' is the movement of ideologies. It is often political and usually has to do with the ideologies of states and the counterideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lechner|first1=Frank|last2=Boli|first2=John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-1-118-73355-4|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ideoscapes''' are usually composed of ideas, terms, and images including “freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation, and democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">[[Integer factorization]] is the process of determining which [[prime number]]s divide a given positive [[integer]]. Doing this quickly has applications in [[cryptography]]. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its [[prime factor]]s; it is currently very difficult to factorize large [[semiprimes]] (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).

== Numbers of a general form ==

The first very large distributed factorisation was RSA129, a challenge number described in the Scientific American article of 1977 which first popularised the RSA cryptosystem. It was factorised between September 1993 and April 1994, using [[quadratic sieve|MPQS]], with relations contributed by about 600 people from all over the Internet, and the final stages of the calculation performed on a [[MasPar]] supercomputer at Bell Labs.

Between January and August 1999, [[RSA-155]], a challenge number prepared by the RSA company, was factorised using [[number field sieve|GNFS]] with relations again contributed by a large group, and the final stages of the calculation performed in just over nine days on the [[Cray]] [[Cray C90|C916]] supercomputer at the SARA Amsterdam Academic Computer Center.

In January 2002, Franke et al. announced the factorisation of a 158-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;953&lt;/sup&gt;+1, using a couple of months on about 25 PCs at the [[University of Bonn]], with the final stages done using a cluster of six Pentium-III PCs.

In April 2003, the same team factored [[RSA-160]] using about a hundred CPUs at [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|BSI]], with the final stages of the calculation done using 25 processors of an [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] [[SGI Origin 200|Origin]] supercomputer.

The 174-digit [[RSA-576]] was factored by Franke, Kleinjung and members of the [[NFSNET]] collaboration in December 2003, using resources at BSI and the University of Bonn; soon afterwards, Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama, Sonoda and Ueda announced that they had factored a 164-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;1826&lt;/sup&gt;+1.

A 176-digit cofactor of 11&lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;+1 was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between February and May 2005 using machines at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and [[Rikkyo University]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/11_281+ |accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=Factorization of 176-digit number|author1=K. Aoki |author2=Y. Kida |author3=T. Shimoyama |author4=H. Ueda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[RSA-200]] challenge number was factored by Franke, Kleinjung et al. between December 2003 and May 2005, using a cluster of 80 Opteron processors at BSI in Germany; the announcement was made on 9 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/rsa200|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=RSA200|author1=F. Bahr |author2=M. Boehm |author3=J. Franke |author4=T. Kleinjung }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later (November 2005) factored the slightly smaller [[RSA-640]] challenge number.

On December 12, 2009, a team including researchers from the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]], the [[EPFL]], [[INRIA]] and NTT in addition to the authors of the previous record factored [[RSA-768]], a 232-digit semiprime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf|accessdate=2013-04-11 |title=Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus|author1=T.

Osvik |author11=H. te Riele |author12=A. Timofeev |author13=P. Zimmermann }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the equivalent of almost 2000
years of computing on a single core 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Opteron]].

== Numbers of a special form ==

12&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 542 bits (163 digits), was factored between April and July 1993 by a team at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] and [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/cabench/sieve-record.html|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=Record Number Field Sieve Factorisations|author=P. L. Montgomery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2&lt;sup&gt;773&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, of 774 bits (233 digits), was factored between April and November 2000 by 'The Cabal', with the matrix step done over 250 hours on the Cray also used for RSA-155.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=233-digit SNFS factorization|author='The Cabal'|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061126/http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|archivedate=2007-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 809 bits (244 digits), had its factorisation announced at the start of January 2003. Sieving was done at the CWI, at the Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Department at Bonn University, and using private resources of J. Franke, T. Kleinjung and the family of F. Bahr. The linear algebra step was done by P. Montgomery at SARA in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-244|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=M809|author=J.

6&lt;sup&gt;353&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 911 bits (275 digits), was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between September 2005 and January 2006 using [[special number field sieve|SNFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/6353|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=SNFS274|author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1039&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1039 bits (313 digits) (though a factor of 23 bits was already known) was factored between September 2006 and May 2007 by a group including K. Aoki, J. Franke, T. Kleinjung, [[A. K. Lenstra]] and D. A. Osvik, using computers at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] and the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0705&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=1019  |accessdate=2007-05-23 | title=Factorization of the 1039th Mersenne number |author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1061&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1061 bits (320 digits) was factored between early 2011 and 4 August 2012 by a group headed by Greg Childers at CSU Fullerton, using the nfs@home [[BOINC]] project for about 300 CPU-years of sieving; the linear algebra was run at the Trestles cluster at SDSC and the Lonestar cluster at TACC and needed additional 35 CPU-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/444 |title=Factorization of a 1061-bit number by the Special Number Field Sieve |author=Greg Childers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All unfactored parts of the numbers 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 with n between 1000 and 1200 were factored by a multiple-number-sieve approach in which much of the sieving step could be done simultaneously for multiple numbers, by a group including T. Kleinjung, J. Bos and [[A. K. Lenstra]], starting in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653 | title=Mersenne Factorization Factory |author1=Thorsten Kleinjung |author2=Joppe W Bos |author3=Arjen K Lenstra | accessdate=2015-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be precise, n=1081 was completed on 11 March 2013; n=1111 on 13 June 2013; n=1129 on 20 September 2013; n=1153 on 28 October 2013; n=1159 on 9 February 2014; 1177 on May 29, 2014, n=1193 on 22 August 2014, and n=1199 on December 11, 2014; the first detailed announcement was made in late August 2014.  The total effort for the project is of the order of 7500 CPU-years on 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz Opterons, with roughly 5700 years spent sieving and 1800 years on linear algebra.

==Comparison to efforts by individuals==

As of the end of 2007, thanks to the constant decline in memory prices, the ready availability of multi-core 64-bit computers, and the availability of the efficient sieving code (developed by Thorsten Kleinjung of the Bonn group) via ggnfs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140917 |title=GGNFS suite -  Browse Files at SourceForge.net |website=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of robust open-source software such as msieve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213020640/http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the finishing stages, special-form numbers of up to 750 bits and general-form numbers of up to about 520 bits can be factored in a few months on a few PCs by a single person without any special mathematical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=124079&amp;postcount=97 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  2LM Table |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bounds increase to about 950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=201624&amp;postcount=106 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  A computation worthy of the name |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 600&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=149332&amp;postcount=114 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  5^421-1 sieving (reservations closed) |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it were possible to secure the collaboration of a few dozen PCs for sieving; currently the amount of memory and the CPU power of a single machine for the finishing stage are equal barriers to progress.

In 2009, Benjamin Moody factored a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the [[TI-83 series|TI-83]] graphing calculator using software found on the internet; this eventually led to the [[Texas Instruments signing key controversy]].

In September 2013, the 696-bit [[RSA numbers#RSA-210|RSA-210]] was factored by Ryan Propper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=18626 |title=RSA-210 factored - mersenneforum.org |website=mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using institutional resources; between March 2013 and October 2014, another 210-digit number (the 117th term in the 'home prime sequence' starting with 49) was completed by a user known as WraithX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=389048&amp;postcount=98 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  HP49(119)... |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using $7600 worth of processing time on Amazon EC2 machines for the sieving, and four months on a dual Xeon E5-2687W v1 for the linear algebra.

==Records for efforts by quantum computers==

The '''International Table Tennis Federation''' ('''ITTF''') is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for all national [[table tennis]] associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/|title=Official ITTF website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the ITTF includes overseeing rules and regulations and seeking technological improvement for the sport of table tennis. The ITTF is responsible for the organization of numerous international competitions, including the [[World Table Tennis Championships]] that has continued since 1926.

==Founding history==
The ITTF was founded in 1926 by William Henry Lawes of Wymondham, the nine founding members being [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Sweden]] and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |title=ITTF Archives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301103409/http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first international tournament was held in January 1926 in [[Berlin]] while the first [[World Table Tennis Championships]] was held in December 1926 in London.

Toward the end of 2000, the ITTF instituted several rules changes aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport. The older 38&amp;nbsp;mm balls were officially replaced by 40&amp;nbsp;mm balls.&lt;ref name="Timeline of TT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?id=13118&amp;category=menus |title=ITTF Table Tennis Timeline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710213034/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?id=13118&amp;category=menus |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the ball's air resistance and effectively slowed down the game.

On 29 February 2008, the ITTF announced several rules changes after an ITTF Executive Meeting in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[China]] with regards to a player's eligibility to play for a new association. The new ruling is to encourage associations to develop their own players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/press_release.asp?ID=14865&amp;PT_Title=&amp;s_Year=&amp; |title=New Rule in Favour of the Development of Table Tennis |publisher=Ittf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312221243/http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/press_release.asp?ID=14865&amp;PT_Title=&amp;s_Year=&amp; |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the ITTF is in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The previous [[president]] of the ITTF was [[Adham Sharara]] from [[Canada]]; the current president since 2014 is {{ill|Thomas Weikert|de}} from Germany.

==Membership==

===Continental Federations===
The ITTF recognises six continental federations.&lt;ref name="ITTF directory" /&gt; Each continental federation has a president as its top official and owns its constitution.&lt;ref name="ittf handbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |title=I T T F |accessdate=2016-08-12 |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904230922/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are recognised federations:

===National Federations===
{{further|:Category:National Members of the International Table Tennis Federation}}

There are currently 226&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Table-Tennis/Features/2017/May/31/Thomas-Weikert-Wins-2017-ITTF-Presidential-Election&lt;/ref&gt; member associations within the ITTF.&lt;ref name="ITTF directory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |title=ITTF Directory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904230922/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf2.asp?category=directory_e |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{National Members of the International Table Tennis Federation|state=expanded}}

==Organisational Structure==
All member associations of the ITTF attend annual general meeting (AGM).&lt;ref name="ittf handbook"/&gt; Agendas on changes of the constitution, laws of table tennis, applications for membership etc. are discussed and finalised through votes. Also, the president of ITTF, 8 executive vice-presidents, and 32 or less continental representatives are elected at an AGM, serving for a four-year term. The president, executive vice-presidents, and the chairman of the athletes' commission compose executive committee.

The executive committee, continental representatives and presidents of the six continental federations or their appointees compose the board of directors (Board). The Board manages the work of the ITTF between AGMs. Several committees, commissions, working groups or panels work under the constitution of ITTF or under the Board.

==Role in diplomacy==
Unlike the organisations for more popular sports, the ITTF tends to recognise teams from generally unrecognised governing bodies for disputed territory. For example, it currently recognises the [[Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo]] even though Kosovo is excluded from most other sports. It recognised the People's Republic of China in 1953 and allowed some basic diplomacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=McCurry |authorlink= |author= |author2= |title=Ping-pong diplomacy back on table as Chinese premier visits Japan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/china |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2008-05-30 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |title=ITTF Archives: 1953 Bucarest AGM Minutes |date=1953-03-23 |work= |publisher=ITTF |page=2 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |quote=Only the People's Republic of China Table Tennis Association was taken at this stage, in order to regularise their playing in the Championships and attending Congress. The Meeting confirmed the Advisory Committee's action in accepting the application. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301103409/http://www.ittf.com/museum/archives/index.html |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
which lead to an opening for [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], called "[[Ping Pong Diplomacy]]", in the early 1970s.

==Rules==

===Player eligibility===
For ITTF World Title events, a player is eligible to play for his association by registering with the ITTF. If the player chooses to play for a new association, he shall register with the ITTF, through the new association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?ID=16537&amp;Category= |title=Information about the Eligibility Rule |date=2008-10-13 |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616204551/http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story2.asp?ID=16537&amp;Category= |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The player shall not represent the new association before.
* The player will be eligible to play for the new association after three, five, seven years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 15, 18, 21 respectively
* If the player is 21 years of age or older, he will not be registered with the ITTF and not be eligible to represent a new association at World Title events.

===Service and point system===
The table tennis point system was reduced from a 21 to an 11-point scoring system in 2001.&lt;ref name="Timeline of TT" /&gt; A game shall be won by the player or pair first scoring 11 points unless both players or pairs score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player or pair subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. This was intended to make games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a player from hiding the ball during service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/museum/ColinEvolution.pdf |title=Rules Evolution |accessdate=2010-07-27 |author=Colin Clemett |format=PDF |publisher=ITTF |page=9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331202309/http://www.ittf.com/museum/ColinEvolution.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to increase the average length of rallies and to reduce the server's advantage. Today, the game changes from time to time mainly to improve on the excitement for television viewers.

===Speed glue ban===
{{See also|Speed glue}}

In 2007, ITTF's board of directors in Zagreb decided to implement the VOC-free glue rule at Junior events, starting from 1 January 2008, as a transitional period before the full implementation of the VOC ban on 1 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittf.com/ittf_misc/Racket_Control_2009__.pdf |title=Official Message to Table Tennis Manufacturers And National Associations |date=2008-11-24 |format=PDF |publisher=ITTF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117100926/http://ittf.com/ittf_misc/Racket_Control_2009__.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2009, all speed glue was to have been banned.

He is the founder of the non-profit Liology Institute, which is dedicated to a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. He is the author of ''The Patterning Instinct'' and ''Requiem of the Human Soul''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Earlier in his career, Lent was the founder, chairman and CEO of the internet company [[NextCard]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=899887|title=NEXTCARD INC (Form: S-1/A, Received: 04/30/1999 09:49:46)|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Lent was born and raised in [[London]]. He graduated from the [[University College School]] and earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeremylent.com/|title=Website of Jeremy Lent – Author of The Patterning Instinct|website=Jeremy Lent  Author and Integrator|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lent left the UK to live in the United States. In 1986, he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is married and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In addition to his writing, Lent is a practitioner of meditation, [[Qigong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]. He is a Level II certified teacher of Radiant Heart Qigong.

== Career ==
Lent joined Strategic Planning Associates, a strategy consulting company based in Washington, D.C. In 1989, he joined First Deposit Corporation (later renamed [[Providian]]), a direct mail [[credit card]] company in San Francisco. Lent was named [[Chief financial officer|Chief Financial Officer]] of Providian in 1991 and left the company in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.'' October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

They said: You might not be able to run as fast as Michael Johnson, or sell as many records as Madonna.&lt;ref name="GuinnessCulture"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqY3qCF-8pQC&amp;q=%5BYou+might+not+be+able+to+run+as+fast+as+Michael+Johnson,+or+sell+as+many+records+as+Madonna,+but+everyone+can+set+a+record,+either+as+an+...+You+might+not+be+able+to+run+as+fast+as+Michael+Johnson,+or+sell+as+many+records+as+Madonna,+but+everyone+can+set+a+record,+either+as+an&amp;dq=%5BYou+might+not+be+able+to+run+as+fast+as+Michael+Johnson,+or+sell+as+many+records+as+Madonna,+but+everyone+can+set+a+record,+either+as+an+...+You+might+not+be+able+to+run+as+fast+as+Michael+Johnson,+or+sell+as+many+records+as+Madonna,+but+everyone+can+set+a+record,+either+as+an&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WaspVdiNFpPHsQTpwYDIBA&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA|title=Guinness World Records 2001|year=2001|author=Tim Footman|author-link=Tim Footman|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75142">This is a list of current [[professional boxing]] rankings, which includes the latest rankings by each one of the sport's four major sanctioning bodies, as well as other well-regarded sites and entities.

==Overview==

As professional boxing has four major sanctioning bodies ([[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]) each with their own champions, the sport doesn't have a centralized ranking system. The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their "Super" and "Regular" champions are excluded from the rankings but their "Interim" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.

In addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|TBRB]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and ''The Ring'' is to crown a single champion for each division. Every single one of these lists are assembled by a committee but since the 90s, other parties have experimented with computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/02/boxrec-coms-computerized-rankings/|title=Boxrec.com's computerized rankings » Boxing News|date=1 February 2015|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbrb.org/mission/|title=FEEDBACK - Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|website=Tbrb.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known computerized rankings are published by [[BoxRec]] and updated daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxing247.com/boxing-news/invaluable-site-boxrecs-new-ratings-the-pound-for-pound-best-of-all-time/57751|title=Invaluable site BoxRec's new ratings: the pound-for-pound best of all-time! - Boxing News|date=14 June 2016|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list compiling the latest installment of all the previously mentioned rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">There have been several claims for the '''longest sentence in the [[English language]]''', usually with claims that revolve around the longest ''printed'' sentence, because there is no limit on the possible length of a written English sentence. 

At least one [[linguistics]] textbook concludes that, in theory, "there is no longest English sentence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-631-19536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by combining shorter [[clause]]s in various ways. 

For example, sentences can be extended by recursively embedding clauses one into another, such as &lt;ref&gt;Morten H Christiansen, Nick Chater, ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog2302_2/epdf Toward a Connectionist Model of Recursion in Human Linguistic Performance]'', ''Cognitive Science'', vol. 23, issue 2, 1999, {{doi|10.1207/s15516709cog2302_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite book

:''The mouse ran away''
:''The mouse that the cat bit ran away''

:''The mouse that the cat that the dog that the man frightened chased bit ran away''

The ability to embed structures within larger ones is called [[recursion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carnie |first=Andrew |page=33 |title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction |edition=third |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Singapore&lt;!-- among others--&gt; |isbn=978-0-470-65531-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or-Y3c9dY4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also highlights the difference between [[linguistic performance]] and [[linguistic competence]], because the language can support more variation than can reasonably be created or recorded.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

==Exceptionally long sentences in print==

One of the longest sentences in literature is contained in [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). The sentence is composed of 1,288 words (In the 1951 Random House version).&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt;

Another sentence that is often claimed to be the longest sentence ever written is Molly Bloom's soliloquy in the [[James Joyce]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922),  which contains a sentence of 3,687 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt; However, this sentence is simply many sentences without punctuation.

[[Jonathan Coe]]'s ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' appears to hold the record at 13,955 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Rebecca |date=3 October 2014 |title=Longest Sentence |work=Today |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/arts/sentence.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by [[Bohumil Hrabal]]'s ''[[Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age]]'': a [[Czech language]] novel written in one long sentence.

'''Media Network''' was the name of a weekly [[radio]] programme broadcast on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] from 7 May 1981 until 26 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about About Media Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430184725/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about |date=30 April 2010 }}, Radio Netherlands Worldwide blog&lt;/ref&gt; When the programme began the station was known as Radio Nederland, but was renamed Radio Netherlands shortly thereafter.  The programme concentrated on [[communications]] topics with particular reference to international [[shortwave]] [[broadcasting]], but also went on to cover [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], [[television]], [[satellite]], [[internet]], reviews of shortwave receivers and other electronic devices. It was produced and presented by Jonathan Marks. In the course of 1994, he was joined by colleague Diana Janssen, who was working as a media researcher at the station, who co-hosted the show until shortly before its end. Media Network ran for over 1000 editions.

==Early history==
[http://www.jonathanmarks.com Jonathan Marks], a British radio producer arrived in the [[Netherlands]] in August 1980. He had previously freelanced for [[Radio Austria International]] in the period 1976-1980 and briefly for the World Radio Club programme running on the [[BBC World Service]]. He was hired as the fifth host of the Radio Nederland "DX Jukebox" programme, a technical show that had been running on the English service since the 1958. His first show was broadcast on 7 August 1980. The content of "DX Jukebox" also revolved around shortwave broadcasting, giving information on schedules for various other stations as well as a variety of details on improving reception. As the name suggested, a portion of the show was devoted to [[music]].

Marks decided that the show needed to be updated to reflect a new era. Fewer listeners were building their own radios. The music was shortened and a name change was also planned for the middle of 1981, with Media Network being the name suggested by Roger Broadbent, a colleague producer. Audience reactions suggested a demand for a new style of programme to be not just about when and on what frequency one could listen to a given station on shortwave, but also about ''why'' one should listen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.omroep.nl/rnw/medianetwork/jonathanwindows500.wmv Jonathan Marks on the history of Media Network] 25th Anniversary vodcast (Copyright Critical Distance B.V.)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, a time when international [[telephony]] was still of a potentially mediocre sound quality (making it unsuitable for shortwave broadcasts), Media Network went against the established wisdom and made extensive use of the telephone. Calls were made to the show's various contributors. On many occasions where telephone quality was deemed too poor for broadcast, a [[Magnetic tape|tape recording]] was made at both ends of the line, then the person with whom Marks was speaking would post the tape to the Netherlands. The two recordings were subsequently edited together resulting in a conversation with much better sound quality.

==Show Format==
Over the years the show had many regular contributors who provided valuable information on stations that went on or off the air, [[radio propagation]] conditions, new communications technology and the development of digital formats such as DAT, CD and DVD. Listeners were also encouraged to [[telephone]] an answer line and leave their comments and questions. These messages became an integral part of the programme.

The show prided itself on being less predictable than its predecessor by reporting from international conferences, compiling thematic documentaries and organising its own research surveys into radio related publications and receivers. On some occasions, the reviews of receivers conducted by the show had an influence on the manufacturers who later contacted Media Network for advice on improving their products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.libsyn.com/media/jonathanmarks/MN.04.05.2000.insiders.mp3 Jonathan and Diana discuss the show's history]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specials covered historic events as conveyed by the media, such as the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Falklands War]] and [[propaganda]] during [[World War II]] and in more recent conflicts. There were also many [[DXpedition]]s or media safari documentaries to profile stations in different parts of the world (e.g. South Africa, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Bonaire).

==Radio Programme Becomes Weblog==
After Diana Janssen left the show in September, 2000 to pursue another career with Forrester Research, Jonathan Marks (who was also employed as Radio Netherlands' Director of Programmes) made the decision to end the show. He cited the increasingly demanding task of fulfilling a corporate role at Radio Netherlands combined with producing a show of a "high standard that we strive for and you deserve".&lt;ref&gt;Media Network edition broadcast 21 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The four editions that followed were replays of popular specials with a finale on 26 October 2000. The editorship of the program was handed over to Andy Sennitt (a frequent contributor also working at Radio Netherlands) who continued the brand as a [[weblog]] until 24 March 2012, shortly before Sennitt retired. The Media Network blog has now been removed from the Radio Netherlands Worldwide site. A copy is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130117071721/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/ archive.org]. No new material or comments will be published there. The Media News aspects of that site have been transferred to the [http://criticaldistance.blogspot.nl/ Critical Distance blog], edited by Jonathan Marks. This is a non-commercial venture.

In February, 2010, Jonathan Marks, now an independent media strategist, launched a project called the '''Media Network Vintage Vault''' which allows the general public to download studio quality editions in [[Mp3]] format. As of July 2015, over 460 editions have been [[digitizing|digitized]] and made available free of charge. Some other programmes made by Jonathan Marks have also been uploaded to the same website, such as "Marks on Mechanics" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to [[DXing]]", a comedic spoof of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] which had shortwave radio as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/index.php?post_category=Media%20Network%20Archives Media Network Vintage Vault] The vault for complete Media Network shows taken from the collection 1981-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "molecular epidemiology" was first coined by Kilbourne in a 1973 article entitled "The molecular epidemiology of influenza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kilbourne ED |title=The molecular epidemiology of influenza |journal=J Infect Dis |date=Apr 1973 |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=478–87 |pmid=4121053 |doi=10.1093/infdis/127.4.478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more formalized with the formulation of the first book on ''Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice'' by Schulte and Perera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice |last1=Schulte |first1= Paul A. |last2=Perera |first2=Frederica P. |year=1993 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=0-12-632346-1 |pages=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of this book is the impact of advances in molecular research that have given rise to and enable the measurement and exploitation of the [[biomarker]] as a vital tool to link traditional molecular and epidemiological research strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in populations.

== Modern use ==
While most molecular epidemiology studies are using conventional disease designation system for an outcome (with the use of exposures at the molecular level), compelling evidence indicates that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous process differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual ("the unique disease principle"),&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; considering uniqueness of the [[exposome]] and its unique influence on [[Molecular pathology|molecular pathologic]] process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman ME, Howatt W, Blows FM, Pharoah P, Hewitt SM, Garcia-Closas M. Molecular pathology in epidemiologic studies: a primer on key considerations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19(4):966-972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science. Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:659-667.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "molecular epidemiology" for this type of research masked the presence of these challenges, and hindered the development of methods and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller LH. Invited commentary: the 21st century epidemiologist--a need for different training? Am J Epidemiol 2012;176(8):668-671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Beck AH, King EE, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Ogino et al. respond to "The 21st century epidemiologist". Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:672-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the premise that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes.

== Analytical methods ==
The genome of a bacterial species fundamentally determines its identity. Thus, [[gel electrophoresis]] techniques like [[pulsed-field gel electrophoresis]] can be used in molecular epidemiology to comparatively analyze patterns of bacterial chromosomal fragments and to elucidate the genomic content of bacterial cells. Due to its widespread use and ability to analyse epidemiological information about most bacterial pathogens based on their molecular markers, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is relied upon heavily in molecular epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Goering, R.|title= Pulsed field gel electrophoresis: A review of application and interpretation in the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease |journal= Infection, Genetics and Evolution |date= 6 August 2010 |volume= 10|issue= 7 |pages= 866–875|pmid= 20692376|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Molecular epidemiology allows for an understanding of the molecular outcomes and implications of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposure, particularly how these choices and exposures result in acquired genetic mutations and how these mutations are distributed throughout selected populations through the use of biomarkers and genetic information. Molecular epidemiological studies are able to provide additional understanding of previously-identified [[risk factor]]s and disease mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific applications include:
* Molecular surveillance of disease risk factors
* Measuring the geographical and temporal distribution of disease risk factors
* Characterizing the evolution of pathogens and classifying new pathogen species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2014|title=Strengthening the Reporting of Molecular Epidemiology for Infectious Diseases (STROME-ID): an extension of the STROBE statement|journal=Lancet Infect Dis|volume=14|issue=4|pages=341–352|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70324-4|pmid=24631223|author=Field, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
While the use of advanced molecular analysis techniques within the field of molecular epidemiology is providing the larger field of epidemiology with greater means of analysis, [[Miquel Porta]] identified several challenges that the field of molecular epidemiology faces, particularly selecting and incorporating requisite applicable data in an unbiased manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Incomplete overlapping of biological, clinical, and environmental information in molecular epidemiological studies: a variety of causes and a cascade of consequences|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=734–738|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.734|pmid=1732039|author=Porta, M.|pmc=1732039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations of molecular epidemiological studies are similar in nature to those of generic epidemiological studies, that is, samples of convenience - both of the target population and genetic information, small sample sizes, inappropriate statistical methods, poor quality control, and poor definition of target populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MRAs have become increasingly common since the formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.  They have been forged within and among various [[trade bloc]]s, including [[APEC]] and the [[European Union]].

MRAs are most commonly applied to goods, such as various [[quality control]] MRAs.  However, the term is sometimes applied to agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications as well.

Accreditation Bodies, under the [[International Accreditation Forum]] use the term ''Multilateral Recognition Agreements'' in a similar sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLA Purpose |url=https://www.iaf.nu/articles/Purpose/15 |website=IAF |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary co-operation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The official and working languages of both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and learned as a foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=2008-08-06|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=2017-06-22|work=ERR|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. Étienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation ("[[Nordek]]") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name="HM2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name="HM2"/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name="HM3"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name="HM3"/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.comingsoon.no/en/theme/education-and-research-in-the-nordic-region/language Language co-operation], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Council have the ability to issue proposals in their own languages, and official documents are translated to cater to all five of the major Nordic languages. Discussions for bringing Finnish and Icelandic into equal footing with the three other languages has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asemaa-parannetaan-pohjoismaisessa-yhteistyoessae|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asemaa parannetaan pohjoismaisessa yhteistyössä|date=2017-11-02|access-date=2018-06-01|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council About the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, but also publishes material in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 |work=Norden |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers The Nordic Council of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged "observers" to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and "observe" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them "observer members" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights" as guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/bag-om-nordisk-raad/the-nordic-council/rules-of-procedure-for-the-nordic-council Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, "within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/sessions-and-meetings/nordic-council-sessions/about-the-sessions-of-the-nordic-council About the Sessions of the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'', namely in all the [[Baltic states]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]] as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsuxRJH&amp;sig=CzVoYbflgNMAIdhyDNtWfiDdtk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+nordic+council+observer+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsvpPKI&amp;sig=vVIg3P4gkhs6kJnW-goho8laWeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53MbMjK3WAhVHQJoKHW_QDmkQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20nordic%20council%20observer%201991&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PVUeUqmHs&amp;sig=cRt4I8tK-gjmM2hSIgRRlK2FyTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/the-faroe-islands-apply-for-membership-in-the-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-of-ministers-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently{{When|date=March 2018}}, three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''origins of [[global surveillance]]''' can be traced back to the late 1940s, when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, whose close cooperation eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network, code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''", in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=November 3, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, [[Edward Snowden]]. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]] were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/15/snowden-has-thousands-of-damaging-nsa-documents-says-greenwald/ Snowden has ‘thousands’ of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald]&lt;/ref&gt; As confirmed by the NSA's director [[Keith B. Alexander]] on September 26, 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records|work=Associated Press|accessdate=October 15, 2013|quote="Is it the goal of the NSA to collect the phone records of all Americans?"

Yes," Alexander replied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the [[Utah Data Center]], a US$1.5 billion [[megaproject]] referred to by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siobhan Gorman|title=Meltdowns Hobble NSA Data Center|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304441404579119490744478398|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=October 19, 2013|quote=The Utah facility, one of the Pentagon's biggest U.S. construction projects, has become a symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess, which gained broad attention in the wake of leaks from NSA contractor Edward Snowden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement "tied the two countries into a worldwide network of listening posts run by [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the U.K.'s biggest spying organisation, and its U.S. equivalent, the National Security Agency."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the [[UKUSA Agreement]], it was created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies during the [[Cold War]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name = EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=July 11, 2001 |format=PDF |page=194 |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its existence had long been known, the UKUSA agreement only became public in 2010. It enabled the U.S. and the U.K. to exchange "knowledge from operations involving intercepting, decoding and translating foreign communications." The agreement forbade the parties to reveal its existence to any third party.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt;

By the late 1990s the [[ECHELON]] system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book "Secret Power". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Fiddler, Stephen (July 1, 2013).

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament stated in its report that the term "ECHELON" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally. The report to the European Parliament confirmed that this was a "global system for the interception of private and commercial communications."&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

The '''pandemic severity index''' ('''PSI''') is a proposed classification scale for reporting the severity of [[influenza pandemic]]s in the United States. The PSI was accompanied by a set of guidelines intended to help communicate appropriate actions for communities to follow in potential [[pandemic]] situations.&lt;ref name=HHS&gt;[[Department of Health &amp; Human Services]], (2007) [http://www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/community/community_mitigation.pdf Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States— Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions] (Full Text of the Initial Report outlining PSI), [[Centers for Disease Control]], USA&lt;/ref&gt; Released by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) on 1 February 2007, the PSI was designed to resemble the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] classification scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Health Officials Unveil Flu Pandemic Plan | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101246.html | quote=U.S. health officials on Thursday outlined an early-warning system similar to that employed for hurricanes to protect and mobilize the country against a flu pandemic. |work=Washington Post |date=1 February 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-21 | first=Amanda | last=Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ties&gt;{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert |author2=Lisa Schnirring | title=HHS ties pandemic mitigation advice to severity | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=1 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0107pandemic.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The PSI was developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) as a new pandemic influenza planning tool for use by states, communities, businesses and schools, as part of a drive to provide more specific community-level prevention measures.&lt;ref name=unveils&gt;{{cite press release | title=HHS unveils two new efforts to advance pandemic flu preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=2007-02-01 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2007/r070201a.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although designed for domestic implementation, the HHS has not ruled out sharing the index and guidelines with interested international parties.&lt;ref name=simple&gt;{{cite news | last=Pellerin | first=Cheryl | title=Simple Planning Tools Can Help in Early Days of Pandemic | publisher=[[USINFO]] | date=12 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/February/20070212130917lcnirellep0.3025629.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128201729/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/February/20070212130917lcnirellep0.3025629.html | archivedate=28 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index and guidelines were developed by applying principles of [[epidemiology]] to data from the history of the last three major flu pandemics and [[seasonal flu]] transmission, mathematical models,  and input from experts and citizen focus groups.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; Many "tried and true"&lt;ref name=praise&gt;{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert |author2=Lisa Schnirring | title=Experts give qualified praise to new pandemic guidance | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=2007-02-02 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0207reactions.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; practices were combined together in a more structured manner:-

{{quote|We also realize as we look back through history is what cities did – 44 cities did, is that many of these measures ultimately every city adopted at some point or another, and the difference may be in the timing of using these measures and whether they're coordinated in an effective way for us to really gain the benefits of them.|Dr Martin Cetron, Director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}

==Context==
During the onset of a growing pandemic, local communities cannot rely upon widespread availability of [[antiviral drug]]s and [[influenza vaccine|vaccine]]s&lt;ref name=simple/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Manning

  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-02-01-flu_x.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Influenza research]]).
The goal of the index is to provide guidance as to what measures various organizations can enact that will slow down the progression of a pandemic, easing the burden of stress upon community resources while definite solutions, like drugs and vaccines, can be brought to bear on the situation. The CDC expects adoption of the PSI will allow early co-ordinated use of community mitigation measures to affect pandemic progression.&lt;ref name =ties/&gt;

==Guidelines==
The index focuses less on how likely a disease will spread worldwide – that is, become a pandemic – and more upon how severe the epidemic actually is.&lt;ref name = transcript&gt;{{cite press release | title=Update of Pandemic Flu Preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control | date=1 February 2007 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/%20t070201.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main criterion used to measure pandemic severity will be [[case-fatality ratio]] (CFR), the percentage of deaths out of the total reported cases of the disease.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;

The actual implementation of PSI alerts is expected to occur after the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) announces [[WHO pandemic phases|phase 6]] influenza transmission (human to human) in the United States. This would probably result in immediate announcement of a PSI level 3–4 situation.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;

{{anchor|Categories}}The analogy of "category" levels were introduced to provide an understandable connection to [[Tropical cyclone scales|hurricane classification]] schemes, with specific reference to the recent aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;
Like the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]], the PSI ranges from 1 to 5, with Category 1 pandemics being most mild (equivalent to [[seasonal flu]]) and level 5 being reserved for the most severe "worst-case" scenario pandemics (such as the 1918 [[Spanish flu]]).&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;

The report recommends four primary [[social distancing]] measures for slowing down a pandemic:
* Isolation and treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed cases of pandemic influenza
* Voluntary home quarantine of household contacts of those with suspected or confirmed pandemic influenza
* Dismissing school classes and closing daycare centers
* Changing work schedules and canceling large public gatherings&lt;ref name=HHS/&gt;

These actions, when implemented, can have an overall effect of reducing the number of new cases of the disease; but they can carry potentially adverse consequences in terms of community and social disruption.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt; The measures should have the most noticeable impact if implemented uniformly by organizations and governments across the US.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;&lt;ref name=simple/&gt;&lt;ref name=praise/&gt;

==Response==
While unveiling the PSI, Dr. [[Martin Cetron]], Director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, reported that early feedback to the idea of a pandemic classification scale has been "uniformly positive".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

The [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy]] (CIDRAP) reports that the PSI has been "drawing generally high marks from public health officials and others, but they say the plan spells a massive workload for local planners". One MD praised that the PSI were "a big improvement over the previous guidance"; while historical influenza expert and author [[John M. Barry]] was more critical of the PSI, saying not enough emphasis was placed on basic health principles that could have an impact at the community level, adding "I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a lot more research [supporting them]".&lt;ref name=praise/&gt;

During the initial press releases in 2007, the CDC acknowledge that the PSI and the accompanying  guidelines were a work in progress and will likely undergo revision in the months following their release.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;

'''Planetary boundaries''' is a concept involving Earth system processes which contain environmental boundaries, proposed in 2009 by a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]]. The group wanted to define a "safe operating space for humanity" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the [[private sector]], as a precondition for [[sustainable development]]. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the [[Industrial Revolution]] have become the main driver of global environmental change. 

According to the paradigm, "transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-to planetary-scale systems."&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=iss_pub|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|year=2009|authors=Rockström et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth system process boundaries mark the safe zone for the planet to the extent that they are not crossed. As of 2009, two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, {{Harvnb|Nature|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"/&gt;

==History of framework==
[[File:Planetary Boundaries.png|thumb|Planetary boundaries diagram of 2009.]]

In 2009, a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]] collaborated with 26 leading academics, including [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel]] laureate [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] and the [[German Chancellor]]'s chief climate adviser [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] and identified nine "planetary life support systems" essential for human survival, attempting to quantify how far seven of these systems had been pushed already.  They estimated how much further humans can go before [[planetary habitability]] is threatened.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Estimates indicated that three of these boundaries—[[climate change]], [[biodiversity]] loss, and the biogeochemical flow boundary—appear to have been crossed. The boundaries were "rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps" which interact in complex ways that are not yet well understood. Boundaries were defined to help define a "safe space for human development", which was an improvement on approaches aiming at minimizing [[Human impact on the environment|human impacts]] on the planet.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; The 2009 report&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; was presented to the General Assembly of the [[Club of Rome]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|2009}} (presentation).&lt;/ref&gt; An edited summary of the report was published as the featured article in a special 2009 edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|others|2009b}}.  &lt;!--

In 2015, a second paper was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' to update the Planetary Boundaries concept&lt;ref name="SteffenEtAl2015" /&gt; and findings were presented at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, January 2015.

A 2018 study, co-authored by Rockström, calls into question the international agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures set forth in the [[Paris Agreement]].  The scientists raise the possibility that even if [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are [[Climate change mitigation|substantially reduced]] to limit warming to 2 degrees, that might be the  "threshold" at which self-reinforcing [[climate feedbacks]] add additional warming until the [[Climate|climate system]] stabilizes in a [[Climate state#Hothouse|hothouse climate state]]. This would make parts of the world uninhabitable, raise sea levels by up to {{convert|60|m|ft}}, and raise temperatures by {{convert|4-5|C-change}} to levels that are higher than any [[interglacial]] period in the past 1.2 million years. Rockström notes that whether this would occur "is one of the most existential questions in science." Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 °C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1810141115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115|journal=PNAS|title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene|authors=Steffen et al.|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|work=The Guardian|title=Domino-effect of climate events could push Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-08-07|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Terra.png|thumb|The planet [[Earth]] is a finite system, which means it has limits.]]

===The idea===
The idea that our planet has limits, including the burden placed upon it by human activities, has been around for some time. In 1972, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' was published. It presented a model in which five variables: [[world population]], industrialization, pollution, food production, and [[resources depletion]], are examined, and considered to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only [[linear function|linear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meadows|others|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the report was widely dismissed, particularly by economists and businessmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer|Nørgård|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Vuuren|Faber|2009}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Graham Turner from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) published "A comparison of ''The Limits to Growth'' with thirty years of reality".&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|2008}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the "standard run" limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time."&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner says these reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report", and said that it "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nørgård|Peet|Ragnarsdóttir|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box
| quote = With few exceptions, economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world, where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts. The very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report ''The Limits to Growth'' was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists. However, this conclusion was mostly based on false premises.

''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the {{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1987 by United Nations' [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]]. It tried to recapture the spirit of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference]]. Its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions. It introduced the famous definition for [[sustainable development]]:

{{quote|"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."|''{{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}''}}

Of a different kind is the approach made by [[James Lovelock]]. In the 1970s he and [[microbiologist]] [[Lynn Margulis]] presented the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory or hypothesis]], that states that all [[organisms]] and their [[inorganic]] surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Lovelock|Margulis|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature ([[homeostasis]]). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of [[greenhouse gas]]es made by humans, is producing [[global warming]].

===From Holocene to Anthropocene===
{{Main|Anthropocene}}

{{quote box
| quote = Our planet’s ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities. The environment—our life-support system—is changing rapidly from the stable Holocene state of the last 12,000 years, during which we developed agriculture, villages, cities, and contemporary civilizations, to an unknown future state of significantly different conditions.

The [[Holocene]] began about 10,000 years ago. It is the current [[interglacial]] period, and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dansgaard|others1993}}; {{Harvnb|Petit|others|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Rioual|others|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stability and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Leeuw|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rockström ''et al.'', we "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and how we have organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

}}

Since the [[industrial revolution]], according to [[Paul J. Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]], Will Steffen and others, the planet has entered a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. In the Anthropocene, humans have become the main agents of change to the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crutzen|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Steffen|Crutzen|McNeill|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Zalasiewicz|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks in the areas of climate change and stratospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}; {{Harvnb|WMO|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other [[biophysical]] processes are also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Folke|others|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since the advent of the Anthropocene, the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shiklomanov|Rodda|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as water vapor flows from the land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing pressure on the Earth's biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing, and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment. According to Rockström et al., "Up to 30% of all mammal, bird, and amphibian species will be threatened with extinction this century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockström|first=John|date=2009|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|url=|journal=Ecology and society : a journal of integrative science for resilience and sustainability|volume=14 |issue=2|pages=473|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to address the issue, because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal boundaries can help keep human activities in check, but are only as effective as the political will to make and enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Nine boundaries==
'''Thresholds and  boundaries'''

The ''threshold'', or climatological [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable (like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produces a large, possibly catastrophic, change in the response variable (global warming).

The threshold points are difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range is defined as the ''boundary''. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

The proposed framework lays the groundwork for shifting approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative [[Externality|externaliti]]es, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if major [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental change]] on a global scale is to be avoided

Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due to the risk of crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt [[environmental change]] within [[continent]]al- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration in the atmosphere &lt; 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[radiative forcing]]); [[ocean acidification]] (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] levels); [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric [[Ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] from a pre-industrial level of 290 [[Dobson Unit]]s); [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen (N) cycle]] (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 35 Tg N/yr) and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus (P) cycle]] (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background [[weathering]] of P); global freshwater use (&lt; 4000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (&lt; 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of &lt; 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are [[Air pollution|chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading]].

==Debate==
===On the framework===
{{quote box
| quote = &lt;center&gt;'''From the  [[Stockholm Memorandum]]'''&lt;/center&gt; Science indicates that we are transgressing planetary boundaries that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years. Evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the Earth’s buffering capacity. Humans are now the most significant driver of [[global change]], propelling the planet into a new geological epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. We can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger tipping points, risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems.

[[Christopher Field]], director of the [[Carnegie Institution|Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology]], is impressed: "This kind of work is critically important. Overall, this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone."&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the conservation biologist [[Stuart Pimm]] is not impressed: "I don’t think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things... The notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content. In what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable?"&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"/&gt; and the environmental policy analyst [[William C. Clark|Bill Clark]] thinks: "Tipping points in the earth system are dense, unpredictable... and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators. It follows that... 'safe operating spaces' and 'planetary boundaries' are thus highly suspect and potentially the new 'opiates'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]] queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all. He thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. "Management based on thresholds, although attractive in its simplicity, allows pernicious, slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlesinger|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the 'limits to growth' debate. "As a scientific organizing principle, the concept has many strengths ... the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers, giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change. They also provide benchmarks and direction for science. As we improve our understanding of Earth processes and complex inter-relationships, these benchmarks can and will be updated ... we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeply—and urgently—about planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Molden|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ocean chemist]] Peter Brewer queries whether it is "truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved ... they may become just another stick to beat citizens with. Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example: it is likely that a large fraction of people on Earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer. How can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits? ... food is not optional."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says the "description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea. We need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present Holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change ... Their paper has profound implications for future governance systems, offering some of the 'wiring' needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources. The planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that, like human rights and representative government, environmental change knows no borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate change policy advisor [[Adele Morris]] thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds. "Staying within a 'safe operating space' will require staying within all the relevant boundaries, including the electorate’s willingness to pay."&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box
| quote = In summary, the planetary boundary concept is a very important one, and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the '[[limits to growth]]'. Importantly, this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in Earth-system processes. As such, it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats, such as climate change.

In their report (2012) entitled "Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A future worth choosing", The High-level Panel on Global Sustainability called for bold global efforts, "including launching a major global scientific initiative, to strengthen the interface between science and policy. We must define, through science, what scientists refer to as "planetary boundaries", "environmental thresholds" and "tipping points"."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2011, at their second meeting, the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gsp High-level Panel on Global Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Nations had incorporated the concept of  planetary boundaries into their framework, stating that their goal was: "To eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, make growth inclusive, and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN GSP 2 meeting|2011}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in their proceedings, panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of "planetary boundaries": "Planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution [...] The planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the "North" to tell the "South" not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves... This language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Sherpa 3 meeting|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Agenda 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''UN Daily News''. For example, the [[UNEP]] Executive Director [[Achim Steiner]] states that the challenge of agriculture is to "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's [[Ecological footprint|footprint]] beyond planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/news/dh/pdf/english/2011/01062011.pdf Sustainable agriculture key to green growth, poverty reduction] ''UN Daily News'', 1 June 2011, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Yearbook 2010 also repeated Rockström's message, conceptually linking it with [[ecosystem management]] and [[Sustainable Governance Indicators|environmental governance indicators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UNEP|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Budapest Declaration}}; {{Harvnb|Greenfield|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in the [[European Environment Agency]] synthesis report ''The European environment – state and outlook 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|Henrichs|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate change====
[[File:Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global annual average temperatures over the years 1880 to 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|The black line shows the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the period 1880–2008. Red bars show temperatures above and blue bars show temperatures below the average temperature. Year-to-year temperature fluctuations are due to natural processes, such as the effects of [[El Niño]], [[La Niña]], and the eruption of large volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USGCRP|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of the difference between the incoming [[Irradiance|radiation energy]] and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth. Positive radiative forcing results in warming. From the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing, averaging about 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, "[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change]". &lt;!-- Same link, formerly titled "Figure SPM.2". --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate scientist [[Myles Allen]] thinks setting "a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 °C." He says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can "meaningfully claim to control", and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C of warming.&lt;ref name="Allen 2009"/&gt;

Adele Morris, policy director, Climate and Energy Economics Project, [[Brookings Institution]], makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view. She puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus.  She favors a system of [[carbon tax|green-house gas emissions tax]], and [[emissions trading]], as ways to prevent global warming. She thinks that too-ambitious objectives, like the boundary limit on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, may discourage such actions.&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"/&gt;

====Biodiversity loss====
According to the biologist [[Cristián Samper]], a " boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Samper|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation ecologist Gretchen Daily claims that "it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation, taken alone, are doomed to fail. Nature reserves are too small, too few, too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. The challenge is to make conservation attractive—from economic and cultural perspectives. We cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We depend on nature for food security, clean water, climate stability, seafood, timber, and other biological and physical services. To maintain these benefits, we need not just remote reserves but places everywhere—more like 'ecosystem service stations.' A few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development. The Costa Rican government is paying landowners for [[ecosystem services]] from tropical forests, including carbon offsets, hydropower production, biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty. [[China]] is investing $100 billion in "ecocompensation," including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration. The country is also creating "ecosystem function conservation areas" that make up 18 percent of its land area.  Colombia and South Africa have made dramatic policy changes, too. Three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success. One: new science and tools to value and account for [[natural capital]], in biophysical, economic and other terms [...] Two: compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy. Three: cooperation among governments, development organizations, corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daily|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|380px|right|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
Since the industrial revolution, the Earth's [[nitrogen cycle]] has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle. "Human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the Earth´s terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones, is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms, or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere."&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers, lakes and the sea, where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems. For example, fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the Gulf of Mexico has damaged [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp fisheries]] because of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]]  thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. He says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable, and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"/&gt;

With regard to nitrogen, the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist Robert Howarth says: "Human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe. The single largest contributor is fertilizer use. But the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions, such as the northeastern U.S. The solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently. Hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix; their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped. (Emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling.) Nitrogen emissions from U.S. power plants could be greatly reduced, too, if plants that predate the Clean Air Act and its amendments were required to comply; these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce.

In agriculture, many farmers could use less fertilizer, and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations|concentrated animal feeding operations]] (CAFOs) is a huge problem.

As recently as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if we ate less meat, less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the [[Mississippi River]] and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howarth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus ====
{{Further|Peak phosphorus}}
With regard to phosphorus, the ocean engineer David Vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental [[phosphorus cycle|flow of phosphorus]] "would be the natural flux: seven million metric tons per year (Mt/yr). To hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 Mt/yr, we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus [...] The flow could be reduced with existing technologies... [lowering] the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 Mt/yr, not very much above the natural flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaccari|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global [[phosphorus]] production rate is reached. Phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neset|Cordell|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some researchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordell|Drangert|White|2009|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

====Ocean acidification====
[[Ocean acidification|Surface ocean acidity]] has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution. About one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms [[carbonic acid]]. This acidity inhibits the ability of corals, shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons. [[Cascade effect (ecology)|Knock-on effects]] could have serious consequences for [[fish stock]]s. This boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries, since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The ocean chemist Peter Brewer thinks "ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in pH, and these may need boundaries too."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"/&gt;

The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks "the main tactics are raising energy efficiency, switching to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, and as they die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage ... Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doney|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land use====
[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|350px|right|Europe land use map. Human land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green)]]

Across the planet, forests, wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other [[land use]]s, impacting freshwater, carbon and other cycles, and reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says research tells us that "the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors. For example, the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways, integrated into the landscape. The boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is, in practice, a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors' overall scientific proposition. Instead, the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss. This would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth systems scientist Eric Lambin thinks that "intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops ... We can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation, freshwater depletion and urban sprawl. This step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices, especially in developing countries. The need for farmland can be lessened, too, by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain, encouraging slower population growth, ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambin|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Freshwater====
[[File:PeakWaterAquifer.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Overexploitation of [[groundwater]] from an [[aquifer]] can result in a [[peak water]] curve.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palaniappan|Gleick|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human pressures on global [[freshwater]] systems are having [[Water crisis|dramatic effects]]. The [[Water cycle|freshwater cycle]] is another boundary significantly affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; Freshwater resources, such as lakes and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). [[Overexploitation]] occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer [[Overdrafting|depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html "Underlying Causes of Deforestation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |date=11 April 2001 }} UN Report.{{who|date=December 2011}}  &lt;!--  **This is a _web page_ that purports to be a UN report, but lacking any information as to where the original may be found.  This is NOT a relible source, and should be removed.** --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to [[peak oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Sandford|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a [[Hubbert peak|Hubbert-like peak]]. A modified [[Hubbert curve]] applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"/&gt;

The [[hydrologist]] [[Peter Gleick]] comments: "Few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of [[peak water]]. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world's major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California's Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred ... The good news is that the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gleick|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden says "a global limit on water consumption is necessary, but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"/&gt;

====Ozone depletion====
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|right|During 21–30 September 2006 the average area of the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest ever observed]]

The stratospheric [[ozone layer]] protectively filters [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) from the [[Sun]], which would otherwise damage biological systems. The actions taken after the [[Montreal Protocol]] appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; However, in 2011, according to a paper published in ''Nature'', the boundary was unexpectedly [[Ozone depletion#Arctic ozone hole|pushed in the Arctic]]; "... the fraction of the Arctic vortex in March with total ozone less than 275 Dobson units (DU) is typically near zero, but reached nearly 45%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manney|Santee|27 others|2011|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel laureate in chemistry, [[Mario J. Molina|Mario Molina]], says "five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion, but it doesn't represent a tipping point".&lt;ref name="Molina 2009"/&gt;

The physicist David Fahey says that as a result of the Montreal Protocol "stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100. The gain has relied, in part, on intermediate substitutes, notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Ongoing success depends on several steps:
* "Continue observing the ozone layer to promptly reveal unexpected changes. Ensure that nations adhere to regulations; for example, the HCFC phaseout will not be complete until 2030.
* "Maintain the Scientific Assessment Panel under the protocol. It attributes causes of changes in the ozone layer and evaluates new chemicals for their potential to destroy ozone and contribute to climate change.
* "Maintain the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel. It provides information on technologies and substitute compounds that helps nations assess how the demand for applications such as refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam insulation can be met while protecting the ozone layer.
"The two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together. Climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere, and compounds such as HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases. For example, the large projected demand for HFCs could significantly contribute to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahey|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric aerosols====
[[Aerosol]] particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence [[monsoon]] and global [[atmospheric circulation]] systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative [[radiative forcing]] (cooling influence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} &lt;!-- Needs author, chapter, and section, with links. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Chemical pollution====
Some chemicals, such as [[persistent organic pollutants]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and [[radionuclide]]s, have potentially irreversible [[Bioaccumulation|additive]] and synergic effects on biological organisms, reducing fertility and resulting in permanent [[genetic damage]].  Sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations. This boundary seems important, although it is hard to quantify.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

A Bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur, have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction among boundaries==
A planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries. Rockström ''et al.'' 2009 did not analyze such interactions, but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels.

For example, the [[land use]] boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached, causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture. At a regional level, water resources may decline in Asia if [[deforestation]] continues in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]].  Such considerations suggest the need for "extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Another example has to do with [[coral reef]]s and [[marine ecosystem]]s. In 2009, {{Harvtxt|De'Ath|Lough|Fabricius|2009}} showed that, since 1990, calcification in the reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef|Great Barrier]] that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years (14% in less than 20 years). Their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of [[aragonite]] is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate. {{Harvtxt|Bellwood|others|2004}} explored how multiple stressors, such as increased nutrient loads and [[fishing pressure]], move corals into less desirable ecosystem states. {{Harvtxt|Guinotte|Fabry|2008}} showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life, particularly species "that build skeletons, shells, and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate. "Increasing temperatures, surface [[UV radiation]] levels and ocean acidity all stress marine [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}, [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/appendix1.pdf Appendix 1. Supplementary Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
{{quote box
| quote = The concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable. It threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth. The fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the [ [[Rio+20]] ] conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo. Had planetary boundaries remained in the statement, the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end. Planetary boundaries will not go away. The intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the Earth System cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking, denial, or omission from official sustainable development conference statements. It is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit.

===The doughnut===
In 2012 [[Kate Raworth]] from [[Oxfam]] noted the Rockstrom concept does not take [[human population growth]] into account.&lt;ref&gt;Raworth, Kate (2012) [http://www.oxfam.org.nz/resources/onlinereports/dp-a-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity-130212-en.pdf A safe and just space for humanity: Can we live within the doughnut?] Oxfam Discussion Paper, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested social boundaries should be incorporated into the planetary boundary structure, such as jobs, education, food, access to water, health services and energy and to accommodate an environmentally safe space compatible with [[poverty eradication]] and "rights for all". Within planetary limits and an equitable social foundation lies a doughnut shaped area which is the area where there is a "safe and just space for humanity to thrive in".&lt;ref name=ITIN&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95227/CLIMATE-CHANGE-Understanding-Rio-20 Climate change: Understanding Rio+20] UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, ''ITIN'', 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenth boundary===
In 2012, [[Steven Running]] suggested a tenth boundary, the annual net global [[primary production]] of all [[terrestrial plant]]s, as an easily determinable measure integrating many variables that will give "a clear signal about the health of ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;

===Not yet endorsed by United Nations ===
The United Nations secretary general [[Ban Ki-moon]] endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 March 2012, when he presented the key points of the report of his High Level Panel on Global Sustainability to an informal [[Plenary session|plenary]] of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ITIN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/science-at-rio-20/news/rio-20-zero-draft-accepts-planetary-boundaries-.html Rio+20 zero draft accepts 'planetary boundaries'] ''SciDev.Net'', 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban stated: "The Panel’s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable, while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sgsm14166.doc.htm Secretary-General Highlights Key Points...] ''United Nations News'', 16 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was incorporated into the so-called "zero draft" of the outcome of the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] to be convened in Rio de Janeiro 20–22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/content/documents/370The%20Future%20We%20Want%2010Jan%20clean%20_no%20brackets.pdf Zero draft of the outcome document] RIO+20, United Nations Conference on Sustainability Development.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference, "partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development. It is also, say observers, because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted, and needed to be challenged, weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at UN negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/features/your-guide-to-science-and-technology-at-rio-20-1.html Your guide to science and technology at Rio+20] ''scidev.net'', 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that three of the boundaries (including climate change) might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed; these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries. In the paper, the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale.

===Agricultural and nutritional impacts===
[[File:Planetary boundaries of agriculture and nutrition.png|thumb|400px|Environmental impacts of agriculture and nutrition within the framework of planetary boundaries according to Meier (2017)&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meier|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human activities related to agriculture and nutrition globally contribute to the transgression of four out of nine planetary boundaries. Surplus nutrient flows (N, P) into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are of highest importance, followed by excessive land-system change and biodiversity loss. Whereas in the case of biodiversity loss, P cycle and land-system change, the transgression is in the zone of uncertainty—indicating an increasing risk (yellow circle in the figure), the N boundary related to agriculture is more than 200% transgressed—indicating a high risk (red marked circle in the figure).&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"/&gt;

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites).

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Large vs. small}}Size ===
There are estimated to be over 51 million pieces of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} as of July 2013. There are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10&amp;nbsp;cm across or larger&lt;ref name="technasa"&gt;[http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/UN_Report_on_Space_Debris99.pdf "Technical report on space debris"], p. 15, United Nations, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) is 29,000.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"/&gt; The technical measurement cutoff is c. {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nasadebris2012"&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3 "Orbital Debris FAQ: How much orbital debris is currently in Earth orbit?"] ''NASA'', March 2012. Retrieved 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit (as of 2002) was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carroll, [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/800Carroll.pdf "Space Transport Development Using Orbital Debris"], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 2 December 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at {{convert|5500|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie and Michael Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/24/spaceexplorationspacejunk "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'"] ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J. Kessler |  access-date = 22 September 2009 |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  archive-date = 27 May 2010 |  dead-url = yes |  df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L. De Fatima | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Hechler | first2 = M. | year = 1981| title = The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981rome.iafcR....V | journal = 32nd International Astronautical Congress | volume = 1981 | issue = | page = 23 | bibcode=1981rome.iafcR....V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

In 1958, the United States launched [[Vanguard I]] into a [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO). {{As of|2009|10}}, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving man-made space objects still in orbit.&lt;ref name="usaweekend"&gt;Julian Smith, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070826/070826space.html#junk "Space Junk"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''USA Weekend'', 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/nrl-vic031308.php Vanguard 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] listed 902 operational satellites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html "UCS Satellite Database"] ''Union of Concerned Scientists'', 16 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

These events continue to occur.  For example, in February 2015, the [[USAF]] [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.&lt;ref name=sn20150506&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gruss|first1=Mike |title=DMSP-F13 Debris To Stay On Orbit for Decades |url=http://spacenews.com/dmsp-f13-debris-to-stay-on-orbit-for-decades/ |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Space News |date=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delta-II Stage2 XSS-10.jpg|thumb|Spent upper stage of a [[Delta II]] rocket, photographed by the [[XSS 10]] satellite]]

These produce a cloud of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which is an electrical risk to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akahoshi | first1 = Y. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Influence of space debris impact on solar array under power generation | url = | journal = International Journal of Impact Engineering | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 1678–1682 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since. [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993, and left adrift.&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure" /&gt; On 24 July 1996, the French [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Cerise (satellite)|Cerise]] was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419 /&gt; its engineers had sufficient time in contact with the spacecraft to send it to a [[parking orbit]] out of GEO.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} On October 13, 2009, [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were likely the result of an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="Mission Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Angelita|title=Terra mission operations: Launch to the present (and beyond)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160008917.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2010, [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="2017Status"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Dominic|title=Mission Status at Aura Science Team MOWG Meeting|date=13 June 2017|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170005606.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2013 GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it uses to maintain attitude.

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original re-entry plan for [[Skylab]] called for the station to remain in space for eight to ten years after its final mission in February 1974. High solar activity expanded the upper atmosphere, resulting in higher-than-expected drag and bringing its orbit closer to Earth than planned.

Radar and optical detectors such as [[lidar]] are the main tools for tracking space debris. Although objects under {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} have reduced orbital stability, debris as small as 1&amp;nbsp;cm can be tracked,&lt;ref&gt;D.

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. They often include data on newly observed, as yet uncatalogued fragments.

By October 2017, both OneWeb—and also SpaceX, with their large [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink constellation]]—had filed documents with the US [[FCC]] with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.&lt;ref name= Anselmo /&gt; Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit.

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed.

=== External removal ===
A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

{{as of|2006}} the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective.&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;{{outdated inline|date=December 2015}} Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan |first=McHarg |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-aims-space-debris.html |title=Project aims to remove space debris |publisher=Phys.org |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, [[Spacecraft capture|capture]] it temporarily to attach a [[smallsat|smaller de-orbit satellite]] and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for [[atmospheric entry]] or move it to a graveyard orbit.

==== Laser methods ====
The [[laser broom]] uses a ground-based [[laser]] to [[Ablation|ablate]] the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20111026&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann|first=Adam |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |accessdate=1 November 2011 |newspaper=Wired Science |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Bekey, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.&lt;ref name=srdc20000816&gt;Justin Mullins [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2426 "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework."], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model. II. Physical Relations for Comets and Meteors | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 464–474 | bibcode=1951ApJ...113..464W | doi=10.1086/145416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the [[interplanetary dust cloud]] or other objects made up from this material, like comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownlee | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Tomandl | first2 = D. A. | last3 = Olszewski | first3 = E. | year = 1977| title = 1977LPI.....8..145B Interplanetary dust: A new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies | journal = Proceedings of the 8th Lunar Scientific Conference | volume = 1977 | issue = | pages = 149–160 | bibcode=1977LPI.....8..145B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabbard diagram.png|thumb|alt=Debris graph of altitude and orbital period|Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000]]
The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

In 2009, [[Rhett and Link|Rhett &amp; Link]] wrote a song called "Space Junk" and made an accompanying music video for the TV series ''[[Brink (TV series)|Brink]]''.  The lyrics refer to two men tasked to clean up debris such as satellites and expended rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy7psIuJjc |author=Rhett &amp; Link |author-link=Rhett and Link |title=Space Junk Song |website=YouTube |type=video |accessdate=18 August 2018 |date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' is a 2013 survival film, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, about a disaster on a space mission caused by [[Kessler syndrome]].

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system.

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Filipino Channel Old.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The old logo of The Filipino Channel (2000s-2011).]]
On September 24, 1994, then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now [[ABS-CBN | ABS-CBN Corporation]]) through its newly established subsidiary ABS-CBN International signed a historic deal with the [[PanAmSat]] to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming service to some two million Filipino immigrants in the United States using the then-newly launched PAS 2 satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jessel|first=Harry|last2=Taishoff|first2=Lawrence|title=Television and Radio|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first headquarters of TFC was built in a garage in [[Daly City, California]] with only eight employees doing all the tasks from managing the phones, the computers, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Journey of Triumph of the Filipino Spirit|url=http://www.abs-cbni.com/about/images/PhilippineNews-TFC15thSuplement-pg1.pdf|publisher=''ABS-CBN International''|date=2009|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117025043/http://www.abs-cbni.com/about/images/PhilippineNews-TFC15thSuplement-pg1.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, TFC has grown to 25,000 subscribers in the United States.

By 2004, TFC has grown to 250,000 subscribers in the United States.

'''''The State of the World's Children''''' is an annual report published by the [[United Nations Children's Emergency Fund]] (UNICEF). It is the flagship publication of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc/ |title=The State of the World's Children reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first report was published in 1980, having been introduced by [[James P. Grant]] (the executive director of UNICEF at the time).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/about/history/index_sowc.html |title=State of the World's Children (1980-1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/obituaries/james-p-grant-unicef-chief-and-aid-expert-is-dead-at-72.html |author=Barbara Crossette |date=January 30, 1995 |title=James P.

Following the end of Grant's tenure at UNICEF and his death in 1995, ''The State of the World's Children'' has received significantly less attention.&lt;ref name=fifield/&gt;{{rp|390}}

==Content==

''The State of the World's Children 1982–1983'' launches the [[child survival revolution]] and pushed for [[GOBI]] (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration therapy]], breastfeeding, and immunization).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1988 report argues for the need of a "Grand Alliance" for children between governments, schools, mass media, etc., to continue the child survival and development revolution.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1991 report features the [[World Summit for Children]], which happened the previous year. The report covers the commitment made by the Summit and serves as a record.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 2015 ''The State of the World's Children'' report, titled ''Reimagine the Future'', reviews the work on children's health and rights in the world in the context of the 25th anniversary of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SOWC_2015_Summary_and_Tables.pdf |title=THE STATE OF THE WORLD’S CHILDREN 2015: Executive Summary |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crop.org/OtherResources/FurtherReading/UNICEF-The-State-of-the-Worlds-Children-in-Numbers-.aspx |title=UNICEF: The State of the World’s Children in Numbers |date=August 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also argued that more innovation is necessary, and highlighted examples including Solar Ear (a solar-rechargeable [[hearing aid]] battery charger) and community-based management of acute malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/state-world-s-children-2015-reimagine-future-innovation-every-child |title=The State of the World’s Children 2015: Reimagine the future - Innovation for every child |date = November 20, 2014 |publisher=reliefweb |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J. Hoffman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/to-save-humanity-9780190221546?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=To Save Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water scarcity''' is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources to meet [[Capitalism#Supply and demand|water demand]]. It affects every continent and was listed in 2015 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as the largest [[Global Risks Report|global risk]] in terms of potential impact over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/why-world-water-crises-are-a-top-global-risk/ |title=Water crises are a top global risk |publisher=World Economic Forum |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of [[groundwater]], and negative impacts on the [[Environment (biology)|environment]].&lt;ref name="FAO2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3015e/i3015e.pdf |title=Coping with water scarcity.

A mere 0.014% of all [[Water distribution on Earth|water on Earth]] is both fresh and easily [[Water supply|accessible]]. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by [[climate change]]) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a '''water crisis'''. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.&lt;ref name="weforum17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdo.nl/sites/default/files/Globaliseringsreeks%203%20Water.pdf |title=Water, bron van ontwikkeling, macht en conflict |publisher=NCDO, Netherlands |date=8 January 2012 |access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between [[freshwater]] demand and availability.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Postel, G. C. Daily, P. R. Ehrlich, Human appropriation of renewable fresh water. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''271''', 785–788 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. G. Savenije, Water scarcity indicators; the deception of the numbers. Physics and Chemistry of the Earth B '''25''', 199–204 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing [[world population]], improving [[living standard]]s, changing [[consumer behaviour|consumption patterns]], and expansion of [[irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] are the main driving forces for the rising global demand for water.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Vörösmarty, P. Green, J. Salisbury, R. B. Lammers, Global water resources: Vulnerability from climate change and population growth. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''289''', 284–288  (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Ercin, A. Y. Hoekstra, Water footprint scenarios for 2050: A global analysis. [[Environment International]] '''64''', 71–82 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]], such as altered weather-patterns (including [[droughts]] or [[floods]]), [[deforestation]], increased [[Water pollution|pollution]], green house gases, and wasteful use of water can cause insufficient supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity |title = Water Scarcity. Threats |work= WWF |year = 2013 |access-date = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but [[Spatial analysis|spatial]] and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.&lt;ref name="7 billion" /&gt; All causes of water scarcity are related to human interference with the [[water cycle]]. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural [[hydrology|hydrological]] variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of [[economic development]], but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref name="FAO2012"/&gt;

Some countries have already proven that decoupling water use from [[economic growth]] is possible. For example, in Australia, water consumption declined by 40% between 2001 and 2009 while the economy grew by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="decoupling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/northamerica/news/2016/half-world-face-severe-water-stress-2030-unless-water-use-decoupled-economic-growth-says |title=Half the world to face severe water stress by 2030 unless water use is "decoupled" from economic growth, says International Resource Panel |publisher=[[UN Environment]] |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations|UN]] states that governments have tended to invest heavily in largely inefficient solutions: mega-projects like [[dam]]s, [[canal]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, pipelines and water reservoirs, which are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable. The most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for [[government]]s to create [[Systems ecology|holistic]] water [[Integrated water resources management|management plans]] that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, [[Water treatment|treatment]], [[Reclaimed water|recycling]], reuse and return to the environment.&lt;ref name="decoupling" /&gt;

==Supply &amp; demand==
[[File:GlobalWaterWithdrawals.jpg|thumb|Global use of freshwater, 2016 FAO data]]
[[File:Annualglobalwaterconsumption.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Global water consumption 1900-2025, by region, in billions m3 per year]]
The total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth, in the form of [[surface water]] ([[rivers]] and [[lakes]]) or [[groundwater]] (in [[aquifer]]s, for example), is 14.000 cubic kilometres (nearly 3359 cubic miles). Of this total amount, 'just' 5.000 cubic kilometres are being used and reused by humanity. Hence, in theory, there is more than enough freshwater available to meet the demands of the current world population of 7 billion people, and even support [[population growth]] to 9 billion or more. Due to the unequal geographical distribution and especially the unequal consumption of water, however, it is a scarce resource in some parts of the world and for some parts of the population.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

Scarcity as a result of consumption is caused primarily by the extensive use of water in [[agriculture]]/[[Animal husbandry|livestock breeding]] and [[industry]]. People in developed countries generally use about 10 times more water daily than those in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="nextgrcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/08/how-water-shortages-lead-food-crises-conflicts |title=Why fresh water shortages will cause the next great global crisis |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 March 2015 |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this is ''indirect use'' in water-intensive agricultural and industrial production processes of [[consumer goods]], such as fruit, oil seed crops and cotton. Because many of these production chains have been globalised, a lot of water in developing countries is being used and polluted in order to produce goods destined for consumption in developed countries.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

==Physical  &amp;  economic scarcity==
Water scarcity can result from two mechanisms:

* [[physical water scarcity|physical (absolute) water scarcity]]
* [[economic water scarcity]]

Physical water scarcity results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity results from poor management of the sufficient available water resources. According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). [http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-2006 Human Development Report 2006: Beyond Scarcity–Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis]. Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
Around one fifth of the world's population currently live in regions affected by [[Physical water scarcity]], where there is inadequate water resources to meet a country's or regional demand, including the water needed to fulfill the demand of ecosystems to function effectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&amp;nbsp;km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= Józefów|pages= 235–250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human right to water==
[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated. Many children are deprived of an education primarily due to this daily task.&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/media/media_53234.html Lack of safe water and sanitation in schools affects children’s learning – and their lives] [[Unicef]] Published 5 April 2010.

Retrieved 03 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Further|Right to water}}
The [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] established a foundation of five core attributes for water security. They declare that the human [[right to water]] entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Millennium Development Goals (MDG)===
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals}}
At the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]], the United Nations addressed the effects of economic water scarcity by making increased access to safe drinking water an international development goal. During this time, they drafted the Millennium Development Goals and all 189 UN members agreed on eight goals. MDG 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015. This would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water. In 2016, the  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] replaced the Millennium Development Goals

==Effects on environment==
Water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, including lakes, rivers, wetlands and other fresh water resources. The resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity, often located in areas of irrigation agriculture, harms the environment in several ways including increased [[salinity]], [[nutrient pollution]], and the loss of [[floodplains]] and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html|title = Water Scarcity Index – Vital Water Graphics|accessdate = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.E. Lawrence |author2=C.P.W. Pavia |author3=S. Kaing|author4=H.N. Bischel|author5=R.G. Luthy|author6= V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59 |pages= 488–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the last hundred years, more than half of the Earth's wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and [[invertebrates]], but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide [[water filtration]] and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the [[Aral Sea]] in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Subsidence, or the gradual sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of [[Houston, Texas]] the land has dropped by more than nine feet due to subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/scarcity/surprisingcosts.php Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/10/14.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownwood, a subdivision near [[Baytown, Texas]], was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since become part of the [[Baytown Nature Center]].

===Climate change===
[[Aquifer]] drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of [[fossil water]] increases the total amount of water within the hydrosphere subject to transpiration and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.

==Depletion of freshwater resources==
[[File:AralShip.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An abandoned ship in the former [[Aral Sea]], near [[Aral, Kazakhstan]]]]
Apart from the conventional surface water sources of freshwater such as rivers and lakes, other resources of freshwater such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater, becoming the main source of clean water. [[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes. The exponential growth rate of the human population is a main contributing factor in the increasing use of these types of water resources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2012. ''The United Nations World Water Development Report 4: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater===
Until recent 2015, groundwater was not a highly utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano, M. and Volholth, K. (ed.) 2007. ''The Agricultural Groundwater Revolution''. Wallingford, UK, Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI).&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world.&lt;ref&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2009. ''Water in a Changing World. World Water Development Report 3.'' Paris/London, UNESCO Publishing/Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable [[buffer capacity]] allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on [[precipitation]] or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. 2007. ''Water for Food, Water for Life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture''. London/Colomb, Earthscan/International Water Management Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Although groundwater sources are quite prevalent, one major area of concern is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. [[Abstracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.

To set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area who uses water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism, and the regular guy getting his water from a well. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don’t waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
Glaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]]. Rising global temperatures have noticeable effects on the rate at which glaciers melt, causing glaciers in general to shrink worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K. 2005. The Karakoram Anomaly? Glacier expansion and the ‘elevation effect’, Karakoram Himalaya. Mountain Research and Development, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 332–40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the meltwater from these glaciers are increasing the total water supply for the present, the disappearance of glaciers in the long term will diminish available water resources. Increased meltwater due to rising global temperatures can also have negative effects such as flooding of lakes and dams and catastrophic results.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K., 1982. Natural Dams and Outburst Floods of the Karakoram Himalaya. Proceedings of the Symposium on Hydrological Aspects of Alpine and High Mountain Areas.

==Measurement==
[[File:Collecting clean water in rural Sindh (5367575654).jpg|thumb|right|In 2012 in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] a shortage of clean water led people to queue to collect it where available]]
Hydrologists today typically assess water scarcity by looking at the population-water equation. This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm
 |title       = Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
 |publisher   = [[UNEP]]
 |author      = Falkenmark and Lindh 1976, quoted in UNEP/WMO
 |accessdate  = 3 February 2009
 |deadurl     = yes

 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces "water scarcity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=1 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' [[FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]. Fao.org. Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank adds that [[climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use, thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring water scarcity include examining the physical existence of water in nature, comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use. This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.

===Renewable freshwater resources===
Renewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.

The following table displays the average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.worldwater.org/datav7/data_table_1_total_renewable_freshwater_supply_by_country.pdf|title = Total Renewable Freshwater Supply, by Country|accessdate = 5 November 2013|website = The World's Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; This table represents data from the UN FAO AQUASTAT, much of which are produced by modeling or estimation as opposed to actual measurements.

==Water stress==
[[File:AfriqueStressHydrique2025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|GEO-2000 estimate for 2025, 25 African countries are expected to suffer from water shortage or water stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEO-2000 overview overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.

===Changes in climate===
Another popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A New York Times article, "Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not [[Global Warming]]", summarizes the findings of Columbia University researcher on the subject of the droughts in the American Southeast between 2005 and 2007. The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall.

==Water crisis==
When there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet"&gt;[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet].

The [[United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises of global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=World water crisis worsened by corruption, repression: UN report |publisher=Un.org |date=20 February 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603001032/http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development].

===Effects of water crisis===
There are several principal manifestations of the water crisis.
* Inadequate access to safe [[drinking water]] for about 885 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inadequate access to [[sanitation]] for 2.5 billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html |title=Updated Numbers: WHO-UNICEF JMP Report 2008 |publisher=Unicef.org |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often leads to [[water pollution]]
* [[Groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] (excessive use) leading to diminished [[agriculture|agricultural]] yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/WORMKA/ |title=Water is Life – Groundwater drawdown |publisher=Academic.evergreen.edu |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overuse and [[pollution]] of water resources harming [[biodiversity]]
* Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in [[war]]fare.

[[Waterborne diseases]] caused by lack of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, waterborne diseases are a leading cause of death. According to the [[World Bank]], 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity.

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying "There is enough water for everyone" and "Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;Segerfeldt, Fredrik (25 August 2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 "Private Water Saves Lives"], ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (1 August 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html "Running Out of Water"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (14 July 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html "Water Crisis"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a "[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]" of wetlands.

In [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].

[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]

On [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that "run red" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.
In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===
There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf Safe Drinking Water]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sudan]] (12.3 million)
* [[Venezuela]] (5.0 million)
* [[Ethiopia]] (2.7 million)
* [[Tunisia]] (2.1 million)
* [[Cuba]] (1.3 million)
Several world maps showing various aspects of the problem can be found in this [https://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2670/26700101.jpg graph] article.&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Jonathan (28 August 2008) [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html "Looming water crisis simply a management problem"]. ''[[New Scientist]]'', pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331153400/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archivedate=2009-03-31 |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |author=Brown, Lester R.|publisher=Earth Policy Institute|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits — [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan.

According to a UN climate report, the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] glaciers that are the sources of [[Asia]]'s biggest rivers – [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween]] and [[Yellow]] – could disappear by 2035 as temperatures rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm |title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion |publisher=Planetark.com |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the source used by the UN climate report actually stated 2350, not 2035.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8387737.stm|title=Himalayan glaciers melting deadline 'a mistake' |date=5 December 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2009|first=Pallava|last=Bagla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090215045754/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 Big melt threatens millions, says UN]. peopleandplanet.net. 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; India, China, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.

==Outlook==
[[File:Madagascar well.jpg|thumb|Wind and solar power such as this installation in a village in northwest [[Madagascar]] can make a difference in safe water supply.]]

Construction of [[wastewater treatment]] plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.

Reducing groundwater overdrafting is usually politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, something the world can ill-afford given the current population.

At more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.

A range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Barry (1 December 2012), http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf  ''easy Jet Traveler''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global experiences in managing water crisis==
{{Essay-like|date=September 2009|section}}

It is alleged that the likelihood of conflict rises if the rate of change within the basin exceeds the capacity of institution to absorb that change.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com" /&gt; Although water crisis is closely related to regional tensions, history showed that acute conflicts over water are far less than the record of cooperation.

The key lies in strong institutions and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, proving to be a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.

One common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a "need-based" instead of a "right–based" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, technicalities of projects define "needs". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the Jordan River Basin, which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River. A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view, move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum, integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits.

The Blue Peace framework developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Turkish Review'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue+Peace_Middle+East.pdf|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deza.admin.ch/en/Home/Projects/Selected_projects/Water_management_and_peace_promotion_in_the_Middle_East eda.base.components.templates.base.accessKeys].

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

[[File:World Heritage Logo global.svg|thumb|[[Logo]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Committee]]]]

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]). It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

===Cultural criteria===
[[File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg|thumb|Site#252: [[Taj Mahal]], an example of a cultural heritage site.|alt=Site#252: The Taj Mahal, an example of a world heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"represents a masterpiece of human creative genius and cultural significance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"exhibits an important interchange of human values, over a span of time, or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning, or landscape design"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural, or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a traditional  human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture, or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO World Heritage, The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Natural criteria===
[[File:Zerbras drinking.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#156: [[Serengeti National Park]], an example of a natural heritage site.]]
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#274: [[Machu Picchu|Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu]], an example of a mixed heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing major stages of Earth's history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems, and communities of plants and animals"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Legal status of designated sites===
UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viborg Kommune - Klejtrup - Verdenskortet 06 ies.jpg|thumb|300px|Europe and Africa]]
The '''World Map at Lake Klejtrup''' ({{lang-da|Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø}}) is a miniature [[world map]] built of stones and grass in [[Klejtrup Sø]] near the village of [[Klejtrup]], [[Viborg Municipality]], [[Denmark]].

In 1943, Søren Poulsen, a local farmer, was working on the drainage of the surrounding meadows when he found a stone shaped like the [[Jutland]] peninsula.  This inspired him to create a small world of his own.&lt;ref name=amazing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/11/the-world-map-at-lake-klejtrup.html |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=November 21, 2015 |format= |work=Amusing Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter months, with the use of primitive tools, he placed big stones carefully on the ice.  When spring arrived, the stones could easily be tilted into place, and in this way the World Map took shape. Some of the stones used weighted more than 2 tonnes.&lt;ref name=ripley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/world-map/ |title=Man Builds Entire World Map in His Back Yard |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=December 2, 2015 |format= |work=Ripley's Believe it or Not |publisher=Ripley Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poulsen created the World Map between 1944 and 1969.  It measures 45 by 90 metres (49 by 98 yards), covering an area of over 4000 square meters (1 acre).&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/a-very-danish-map-of-the-world |title=A Very Danish Map of the World |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |last=Jacobs |first=Frank |work=Big Think |publisher=The Big Think Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One 111-kilometre (69 mi) [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] corresponds to 27 centimetres (11 [[inch|inches]]) on the map.&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; On Poulsen's map, [[Antarctica]] is not present and the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is marked in two places, ensuring a better impression of the correct distances between the countries to avoid the difficulties of spreading out our planet's globular shape.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; Red poles mark the [[equator]], and each country is represented by miniature flags, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/02/priority-world-map-lake-klejtrup-danish-farmer-spent-last-25-years-life-built-version-world/ |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup: A Danish farmer spent the last 25 years of his life building his own miniature version of the world |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |publisher=The Vintage News }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=ripley /&gt; which are updated yearly.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; State borders in the [[United States of America]] are marked with yellow bricks; Poulsen lived 20 years in America.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt;

The '''World Rugby Rankings''' (formerly the '''IRB Rankings''') is a [[ranking]] system for  men's national teams in [[rugby union]], managed by [[World Rugby]], the sport's governing body. The teams of World Rugby's member nations are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded on the basis of the results of World Rugby-recognized international matches. Rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. The ranking system was introduced the month before the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], with the first new rankings issued on 8 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2003/0910/breaking64.html |title=England top IRB rankings, Ireland third |publisher=[[The Irish Times| Times]]|date=2003-09-09 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank leaders==
&lt;div style=text-align:center;float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em&gt; '''World Rugby Ranking Leaders'''&lt;br&gt;{{IRB World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;

When the system was introduced [[England national rugby union team|England]] were the top team and maintained that position following victory in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] took the lead from 7 June 2004. After winning the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] final, South Africa became the third team to achieve first place. The first two fixtures of the [[2008 Tri Nations Series|2008 Tri Nations]] resulted in the top two teams switching places: the All Blacks regained the top spot after defeating South Africa in the Tri-Nations opener on 5 July 2008 [[Westpac Stadium|in Wellington]]; a week later the Springboks returned the favour [[Carisbrook|in Dunedin]], scoring their first win over the All Blacks in New Zealand since 1998, reclaiming the top spot, only for the All Blacks to defeat both Australia and South Africa in August 2008 to regain the top spot by a considerable margin. South Africa regained the lead in July 2009 after beating New Zealand in Bloemfontein and kept the lead until losing to France in November of that year, allowing the All Blacks to regain the top spot.

New Zealand have been the most consistently ranked #1 team since the introduction of IRB World Rankings, having held the #1 ranking for more than 85 percent of the time during this period. South Africa and England make up the remainder.

== Current calculation method==
All World Rugby member countries have been given a rating that is in the range of 0 to 100 with the top side achieving a rating of about 90 points. The point system is calculated using a 'Points Exchange' system, in which sides receive points from each other on the basis of the match result – whatever one side gains, the other loses. The exchanges are based on the match result, the ranking of each team, and the margin of victory, with an allowance for home advantage. As the system aims to depict current team strengths, past successes or losses will fade and be superseded by more recent results. Thus, it is thought that it will produce an accurate picture depicting the actual current strength and thus rank of the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/explain/index.html |title=Rankings Explanation |accessdate=2007-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005062318/http://www.irb.com/rankings/explain/index.html |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings are responsive to results and it is possible to climb to the top from the bottom (and vice versa) in fewer than 20 matches. As all matches are worth a net of 0 points for the two teams combined, there is no particular advantage to playing more matches. A rating stays the same until the team plays again. Although matches often result in points exchanges, 'predictable' results lead to very minor changes, and may result in no change to either side's rating.

===Rules===
The system ensures that it is representative of the teams' performance despite playing differing numbers of matches per annum, and the differing strength of opposition that teams have to face. The factors taken into account are as follows:
*Match result
*Match status
*Opposition strength
*Home advantage

====Match result====
For each match played points exchanges are awarded for the following five outcomes and was developed using results of international matches from 1871 to the present day: 
* a win or loss by more than 15 points
* a win or loss by up to 15 points
* a draw

====Match status====
Different matches have different importance to teams, and World Rugby has tried to respect this by using a weighting system, where the most significant matches are in the World Cup Finals. Points exchanges are doubled during the [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] Finals to recognise the unique importance of this event. All other full international matches are treated the same, to be as fair as possible to countries playing a different mix of friendly and competitive matches. Matches that do not have full international status do not count.

====Opposition strength====
A win against a very highly ranked opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, so the strength of the opposing team is a factor. Thus match results are more important than margins of victory in producing accurate rankings. This is because when a highly ranked team plays a lowly ranked team and manages to beat them by over 50 points, it does not necessarily indicate how either team will perform in the future.

==== Home advantage ====
When calculating points exchanges, the home side is handicapped by treating them as though they are three rating points better than their current rating. This results in the home side gaining fewer points for winning and losing more points for losing. Because of this, ideally, any advantage that a side may have by playing in front of their home crowd is cancelled out.

==== New and dormant nations====
All new member nations start with 30.00 points, which is provisional until they have completed ten [[Rugby union#Major international competitions|test matches]]. When countries merge, the new country inherits the higher rating of the two countries but when they split e.g., the 2010 breakup of the [[Arabian Gulf rugby union team]] into separate teams representing its current member countries, the new countries will inherit a rating at a fixed level below the rating of the original country.

Before 1 December 2012 new member nations were given 40.00 points.

Countries that have not played a [[Rugby union#Major international competitions|test]] for two years are removed from the ranking system and the list. If they become active again, they resume their previous rating.

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia]]
[[File:Ball's Pyramid2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.78|Most of Zealandia is underwater. [[Ball's Pyramid]], near [[Lord Howe Island]], is one place where it rises above sea level]]

Zealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a [[Aulacogen|failed]] [[rift]], where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled [[graben]]. The ridges rise above the [[seabed|sea floor]] to heights of {{convert|1000|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with few rocky [[island]]s rising above [[sea level]]. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

About 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the [[Pacific Plate]]) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]). The resulting displacement by approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the [[Alpine Fault]] is evident in geological maps.&lt;ref name="UNCLOS map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |title=Figure 4. Basement rocks of New Zealand |work=UNCLOS Article 76: The Land mass, continental shelf, and deep ocean floor: Accretion and suturing |accessdate=21 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142136/http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement along this plate boundary has also offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the [[Bounty Trough]].

Compression across the boundary has uplifted the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the [[Coromandel Peninsula|Coromandel]] and [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]s. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.

Volcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it [[rift]]ed away from the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest with respect to the underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia.

This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late [[Miocene]] [[shield volcano]]es that developed the [[Banks Peninsula|Banks]] and [[Otago Peninsula]]s. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the [[Late Cretaceous]] and the [[Cenozoic]]. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the [[Miocene]], the northern section of Zealandia ([[Lord Howe Rise]]) might have slid over a stationary [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], forming the [[Lord Howe Seamount Chain]].

Zealandia is occasionally divided by scientists into two regions, North Zealandia (or Western Province) and South Zealandia (or Eastern Province), the latter of which contains most of the Median [[Batholith]] crust. These two features are separated by the [[Alpine Fault]] and [[Kermadec Trench]] and by the wedge-shaped [[Hikurangi Plateau]], and are moving separately to each other.&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt;

=== Classification as a continent ===
The case for Zealandia being a continent in its own right was argued by Nick Mortimer and Hamish Campbell in their book ''Zealandia: Our continent revealed'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt; citing geological and ecological evidence to support the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Yarwood, V. |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |series=Book Review |title=Zealandia: Our continent revealed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729235207/https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |magazine=New Zealand Geographic |date=November–December 2014 |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a team of eleven geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a drowned continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment.&lt;ref name=mortimer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortimer |first1=Nick |last2=Campbell |first2=Hamish J. |title=Zealandia: Earth’s Hidden Continent |journal=GSA Today |volume=27 |year=2017 |url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |doi=10.1130/GSATG321A.1 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217064642/https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |archive-date=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely covered by news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Randall |title=Meet Zealandia: Earth's latest continent |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |agency=CNN |date=16 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217050332/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |archivedate=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Elle |title=Zealandia – pieces finally falling together for continent we didn't know we had |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |agency=The Guardian |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226124213/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |archive-date=26 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=East |first1=Michael |title=Scientists discover 'Zealandia' – a hidden continent off the coast of Australia |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |publisher=The Telegraph |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218202907/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |archive-date=18 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeography ==
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the [[Antarctic Flora]], including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], logs of a [[fossil]]ized [[forest]] closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |title=Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |archive-date=17 October 2008 |access-date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by [[silica]] to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.

During glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]] fauna, but [[Saint Bathans mammal|the discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw]] from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last1=Campbell |first1=Hamish |author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=North Shore, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-14-302088-2 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political divisions ==
[[File:Zealandia EEZs.tif|thumb|right|[[Exclusive economic zone]] of New Zealand and continental shelf boundaries for much of Zealandia]]

The total land area (including [[internal waters|inland water bodies]]) of Zealandia is {{convert|286655|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this, [[New Zealand]] comprises the majority, at {{convert|267988|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, or 93%) which includes the mainland, nearby islands, and most outlying islands including the [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], [[Campbell Islands]], and [[Chatham Islands]] (but not the [[Kermadec Islands]] or [[Macquarie Island]] ([[Australia]]), which are part of the rift).

[[New Caledonia]] and the islands surrounding it comprise some {{convert|18576|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 7%) and the remainder is made up of various [[States and territories of Australia|territories]] of [[Australia]] including [[Lord Howe Island]] Group ([[New South Wales]])  at {{convert|56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.02%), [[Norfolk Island]] at {{convert|35|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.01%), as well as [[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef]]s ([[Coral Sea Islands]] Territory) with {{convert|0.25|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

== Population ==
The total human population of Zealandia today is about 5&amp;nbsp;million people.
