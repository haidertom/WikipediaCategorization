      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20217">'''The 10 Essential Public Health Services''' is a US government document which codifies the responsibilities of [[public health]] agencies and institutions in the United States.&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP): 10 Essential Public Health Services." Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/essentialservices.html. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Organized according to the "three fundamental purposes of public health" — assessment, policy development, and assurance — the essential services include the following:

===Assessment===
*Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems.
*Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community.

===Policy development===
*Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues.
*Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems.
*Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts.

===Assurance===
*Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety.
*Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable.
*Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce.
*Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services.
*Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

==History==
In 1988, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, ''The Future of Public Health''. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in "disarray" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the "three fundamental purposes of public health." These purposes included "assessment, policy development, and assurance."&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health. (1988). The future of public health. Washington DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton’s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to
#explain what public health is,
#clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and
#provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.

These efforts culminated in the publication of ''The Essential Services of Public Health'' in late 1994.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;Harrell JA, Baker EL. The essential services of public health. Leadership Public Health. 1994;3(3): 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;
Public Health Units
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
The report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Scutchfield, F. D., Mays, G. P., &amp; Lurie, N. (2009). Applying Health Services Research to Public Health Practice: An Emerging Priority. Health Services Research, 44(5p2), 1775–1787. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref name="vi"&gt;Miller, C. A., K. S. Moore, T. B. Richards, and C. McKaig. 1994. "A Screening Survey to Assess Local Public Health Performance." Public Health Report 109 (5): 659–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vii"&gt;Turnock, B. J., and A. S. Handler. 1997. "From Measuring to Improving Public Health Practice." Annual Review of Public Health 18: 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viii"&gt;Handler, A. S., B. J. Turnock, W. Hall, S. Potsic, J. Munson, R. Nalluri, and E. H. Vaughn. 1995. "A Strategy for Measuring Local Public Health Practice." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 11 (6 Suppl): 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/ National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)]. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as "the fundamental framework" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments — The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment — and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

==List of services==

===Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems===
It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community’s health status.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;County of Los Angeles Public Health. "Frequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles County Health Survey" Retrieved from http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/LAC HS_FAQs.htm. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.

===Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community===
In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, [[bioterrorism]], mass casualties and chemical emergencies.

===Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues===
Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Choose Health LA. "Eat Healthy." Retrieved from http://www.choosehealthLA.com/eat-healthy/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055003/http://www.choosehealthla.com/eat-healthy/ |date=2013-02-17 }}. Accessed on 2/4/13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.

===Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems===
Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. [[First 5 LA]] is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;[[First 5 LA]]. "Champions of Our Children." Retrieved from http://www.first5la.org/About-Us. Accessed on 2/5/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.

===Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts===
Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&amp;nbsp;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;The New York Times. "New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary". Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?pagewanted=all. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Rammohan, V, et al. "Effects of Dram Shop Liability and Enhanced Overservice Law Enforcement Initiatives on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms: Two Community Guide Systematic Reviews." Am J Prev Med 2011;41(3):334 –343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety===
It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

===Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable===
Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="xiv"&gt;The White House. "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Overview of the Agency Operational Plans." Retrieved from http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213232017/http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce===
Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not. Components of this service include: making sure that the workforce meets the health needs of the population, maintaining public health workforce standards by developing and implementing efficient licensure and credentialing processes and incorporating core public health competencies into personnel systems, and adopting continuous quality improvement methods and long-term learning opportunities for public health workforce members.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In two 2002 reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended instituting a certification examination as a way of ensuring minimum competence in public health.&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "The Future of the Public’s Health in the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070844/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131227130612/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based training strategies may be useful in providing the long-term learning opportunities that many current and upcoming public health workers need in order to serve as well-informed advocates of public health and safety.&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Ballew, P. et al. "Developing web-based training for public health practitioners: what can we learn from a review of five disciplines?" Health Education Research. 2012;1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services ===
Given scarce resources, it is important to keep track of whether or not programs and/or policies end up producing intended outcomes. Components of this service include: assessing the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of services and programs delivered; providing policymakers with the information they need in order to make well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources; tracking efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services analyzing data on health status and service utilization; and striving to improve the public health system’s capacity to well serve the population.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis has been proposed as one possible strategy for informing policymakers on how best to allocate health care resources.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Eichler, H, Kong, SX, Gerth, WC, and Mavros, P. "Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care resource allocation decision-making: how are cost-effectiveness thresholds expected to emerge." Value in Health. 2004;7(5): 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems ===
Through research, the health and health care problems that individuals face can be better understood, and therefore be better and more appropriately addressed given the evidence provided by such research efforts. Components of this service include: fostering the development of a continuum of innovative solutions for health programming in terms of both practical field-based efforts as well as academic efforts, establishing a consortium of research institutions and other institutions of higher learning to encourage more collaborative and cross-cutting efforts, and ensuring the public health system’s capacity to perform timely epidemiological and health policy analyses.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

An '''admission, discharge, and transfer''' ('''ADT''') '''system''' is a backbone system for the structure of other types of business systems. An ADT system is one of four types of core business systems: ADT, financial, scheduling, and [[Acute medicine|acuity]] (McGonigle, D., &amp; Mastrain, K., 2012). Core business systems are systems used in a health care facility for financial payment, [[quality improvement]], and encouraging [[best practices]] that research has proven beneficial. 

Used in health care, an ADT system is usually the foundation for other types of [[health care informatics|health care information systems]] because it holds valuable patient information such as a [[medical record]] number, age, name, and contact information. Using the ADT system, patient information can be shared, [[medical privacy|when appropriate]], with other health care facilities and systems (McGonigle, D., &amp; Mastrain, K., 2012). ADT systems can also be used as an alert system upon a patient's admission (Pittet, D., Safran, E., et al., 1996). This can be helpful if a patient has had a [[medical history|history]] of an infectious disease or heart ailments. When admitted, the ADT system may alert the admitting staff that the patient needs to be in an [[Hospital-acquired infection#Isolation|isolation room]] or on a cardiac floor, for example.

'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered [[bad cholesterol]] levels in middle-aged adults.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; In 2013, the ''BMJ'' published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a [[statin]] a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=A. D. M.|last2=Mizdrak|first2=A.|last3=Scarborough|first3=P.|title=A statin a day keeps the doctor away: comparative proverb assessment modelling study|journal=BMJ|date=17 December 2013|volume=347|issue=dec17 2|pages=f7267–f7267|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7267|lay-url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255219148/an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-and-statins-do-too}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P. W.|last3=Sirovich|first3=Brenda E.|title=Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 May 2015|volume=175|issue=5|pages=777|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.5466|lay-url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-an-apple-a-day-really-keep-the-doctor-away/|pmc=4420713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘[[Golden Delicious]]’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/04/gardens-truth-about-apples-james-wong | title=Gardens: the truth about apples | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=James, Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biomechanics]], '''balance''' is an ability to maintain the line of gravity (vertical line from [[centre of mass]]) of a body within the base of support with minimal postural sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shumway-Cook A, Anson D, Haller S |title=Postural sway biofeedback: its effect on reestablishing stance stability in hemiplegic patients|journal=Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil.|year= 1988|volume= 69|pages= 395–400|pmid=3377664|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sway is the horizontal movement of the centre of gravity even when a person is standing still. A certain amount of sway is essential and inevitable due to small perturbations within the body (e.g., breathing, shifting body weight from one foot to the other or from forefoot to rearfoot) or from external triggers (e.g., visual distortions, floor translations). An increase in sway is not necessarily an indicator of dysfunctional balance so much as it is an indicator of decreased sensorimotor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|author2=Madigan, Nussbaum|title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|issue=92|pages=183–189|pmid=15549370|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|volume=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the [[vestibular system|vestibular]], [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]], and [[visual system]]s.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gribble|author2=Hertel|title=Effect of Lower-Extremity Fatigue on Postural Control|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=2004|issue=4|pages=589–592|pmid=15083434|volume=85|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.06.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vestibular system: sense organs that regulate equilibrium ([[equilibrioception]]); directional information as it relates to head position (internal gravitational, linear, and angular acceleration)
* Somatosensory system: senses of [[proprioception]] and [[kinesthesia]] of joints; information from skin and joints (pressure and vibratory senses); spatial position and movement relative to the support surface; movement and position of different body parts relative to each other
* Visual system: Reference to verticality of body and head motion; spatial location relative to objects

The senses must detect changes of spatial orientation with respect to the base of support, regardless of whether the body moves or the base is altered. There are environmental factors that can affect balance such as light conditions, floor surface changes, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drugs]], and [[ear infection]].

There are balance impairments associated with aging. Age-related decline in the ability of the above systems to receive and integrate [[Sense|sensory]] information contributes to poor balance in [[older adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmitz, T. J. |year=2007|chapter= Examination of Sensory Function|editors= S. B. O’Sullivan &amp; T.J. Schmitz |title=Physical Rehabilitation|edition=5th |pages=121–157|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher= F. A. Davis Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the elderly are at an increased risk of [[Falling (accident)|falls]]. In fact, one in three adults aged 65 and over will fall each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |authors= National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|date=8 December 2010|title=Costs of Falls Among Older Adults|accessdate= 15 May 2011|url= https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/fallcost.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an individual standing quietly upright, the limit of stability is defined as the amount of postural sway at which balance is lost and corrective action is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7644574|year=1995|last1=Nichols|first1=DS|last2=Glenn|first2=TM|last3=Hutchinson|first3=KJ|title=Changes in the mean center of balance during balance testing in young adults|volume=75|issue=8|pages=699–706|journal=Physical therapy}} [http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/reprint/75/8/699.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
	  
Body sway can occur in all planes of motion, which make it an increasingly difficult ability to rehabilitate. There is strong evidence in research showing that deficits in postural balance is related to the control of medial-lateral stability and an increased risk of falling. To remain balanced, a person standing must be able to keep the vertical projection of their center of mass within their base of support, resulting in little medial-lateral or anterior-posterior sway. Ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people.  The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with body sway. Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed physiological limits. Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilbreath SL, Raymond J, Refshauge KM | year = 2000 | title = The effect of recurrent ankle inversion sprain and taping on proprioception at the ankle | url = | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 10–5 | doi=10.1097/00005768-200001000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40% of patients with ankle sprains suffer from instability and an increase in body sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guskiewicz KM, Perrin DH | year = 1996 | title = Effect of orthotics on postural sway following inversion [[ankle sprain]]. | url = | journal = Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 326–331 | doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Injury to the ankle causes a proprioceptive deficit and impaired postural control.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to ankle injury than those with better postural control.

Balance can be severely affected in individuals with neurological conditions. People who suffer a [[stroke]] or [[spinal cord injury]] for example, can struggle with this ability. Impaired balance is strongly associated with future function and recovery after a stroke, and is the strongest predictor of falls.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lubetzki-Vilnai, A. |author2=Kartin, D.| year=2010| title=The effect of balance training on balance performance in individuals poststroke: a systematic review| journal=Journal of Neurologic Physical Therapy| volume=34 | pages=127–137 | doi=10.1097/NPT.0B013E3181EF764D|pmid=20716987|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another population where balance is severely affected is Parkinson's disease patients. A study done by Nardone and Schieppati (2006) showed that individuals with Parkinson's disease problems in balance have been related to a reduced limit of stability and an impaired production of anticipatory motor strategies and abnormal calibration.

Balance can also be negatively affected in a normal population through fatigue in the musculature surrounding the ankles, knees, and hips.  Studies have found, however, that muscle fatigue around the hips (gluteals and lumbar extensors) and knees have a greater effect on postural stability (sway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=B.S. |author2=Madigan, M.L. |author3=Nussbaum, M.A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|volume=93|pages=183–189|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|pmid=15549370|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is thought that muscle fatigue leads to a decreased ability to contract with the correct amount of force or accuracy.  As a result, proprioception and kinesthetic feedback from joints are altered so that conscious joint awareness may be negatively effected.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004" /&gt;

==Balance training==
[[File:Balancing girl 2009.jpg|left|thumb|Balance]]
[[File:Plank on a pair of medicine balls.jpg|right|thumb|Balance Training]]
Since balance is a key predictor of recovery and is required in so many of our [[activities of daily living]], it is often introduced into treatment plans by [[physiotherapists]] and occupational therapists when dealing with geriatrics, patients with neurological conditions, or others whom they have determined it to be beneficial.

Balance training in [[stroke]] patients has been supported in the literature.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammer et al. (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hammer, A. |author2=Nilsagard, Y. |author3=Wallquist, M. |last-author-amp=yes| year=2008| title=Balance training in stroke patients a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials| journal=Advances in Physiotherapy| volume=10 | pages=163–172| doi=10.1080/14038190701757656|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods commonly used and proven to be effective for this population include sitting or standing balance practice with various progressions including reaching, variations in base of support, use of tilt boards, gait training varying speed, and stair climbing exercises.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"/&gt; Another method to improve balance is perturbation training, which is an external force applied to a person's center of mass in an attempt to move it from the base of support.&lt;ref name="meddic"&gt;Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing © Farlex 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The type of training should be determined by a physiotherapist and will depend on the nature and severity of the stroke, stage of recovery, and the patient’s abilities and impairments after the stroke.

Populations such as the elderly, children with neuromuscular diseases, and those with motor deficits such as chronic ankle instability have all been studied and balance training has been shown to result in improvements in postural sway and improved “one-legged stance balance” in these groups.&lt;ref name=Gran&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2010|title= Effects of balance training on postural sway, leg extensor strength, and jumping height in adolescents|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume= 81|issue=3|pages= 245–251|author=Granacher, U. |author2=Gollhofer, A. |author3=Kriemler, S. |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.5641/027013610X13088573595943 |pmid=20949844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of balance training can be measured by more varied means, but typical quantitative outcomes are [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|centre of pressure]] (CoP), postural sway, and static/dynamic balance, which are measured by the subject’s ability to maintain a set body position while undergoing some type of instability.&lt;ref name=Gran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Zech, A., Hübscher, M., Vogt, L., Banzer, W., Hänsel, F., &amp; Pfeifer, K. |year=2010|title= Balance training for neuromuscular control and performance enhancement: A systematic review|journal= Journal of Athletic Training|volume= 45|issue=4|pages=392–403|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-45.4.392|pmid=20617915|pmc=2902034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of exercise  (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) improve clinical balance outcomes in older people, and are seemingly safe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Tracey E.|last2=Rochester|first2=Lynn|last3=Neil|first3=Fiona|last4=Skelton|first4=Dawn A.|last5=Ballinger|first5=Claire|date=2011-11-09|title=Exercise for improving balance in older people|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=11|pages=CD004963|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004963.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22071817}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still insufficient evidence supporting general physical activity, computerized balance programs or vibration plates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Functional balance assessments==
Functional tests of balance focus on maintenance of both static and dynamic balance, whether it involves a type of perturbation/change of CoM or during quiet stance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Susan |last1=O'Sullivan|first2=Thomas |last2=Schmitz|title=Physical Rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=Philadelphia|pages=254–259|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized tests of balance are available to allow allied health care professionals to assess an individual’s postural control. Some functional balance tests that are available are:
*'''[[Romberg's test|Romberg Test]]''': used to determine proprioceptive contributions to upright balance. Subject remains in quiet standing while eyes are open. If this test is not difficult enough, there is a Sharpened Romberg's test. Subjects would have to have their arms crossed, feet together and eyes closed. This decreases the base of support, raises the subject's center of mass, and prevents them from using their arms to help balance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Functional Reach Test''': measures the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm’s length while maintaining feet planted in a standing position.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''[[Berg Balance Scale]]''': measures static and dynamic balance abilities using functional tasks commonly performed in everyday life.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt; One study reports that the Berg Balance Scale is the most commonly used assessment tool throughout [[stroke rehabilitation]], and found it to be a sound measure of balance impairment in patients following a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Lisa|author2=Korner-Bitensky, Nicol|title=Usefulness of the Berg Balance Scale in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review|journal=Physical Therapy|date=May 2008|volume=88|issue=5|pages=559–566|doi=10.2522/ptj.20070205|pmid=18292215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA)''': measures both static and dynamic balance using tasks testing balance and [[gait]].&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Timed Get Up and Go Test''': measures dynamic balance and mobility.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Balance Efficacy Scale''': self-report measure that examines an individual’s confidence while performing daily tasks with or without assistance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Star Excursion Test''': A dynamic balance test that measures single stance maximal reach in multiple directions.&lt;ref name=Hrys&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hrysomallis, C. |year=2011|title=Balance ability and athletic performance|journal= Sports Medicine|volume= 41|issue=3|pages=221–232|doi=10.2165/11538560-000000000-00000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Balance Evolution Systems Test (BESTest)''': Tests for 6 unique balance control methods to create a specialized rehabilitation protocol by identifying specific balance deficits.&lt;ref name="Horak, et al."&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2009|title= The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) to Differentiate Balance Deficits|journal=Journal of the American Physical Therapy Association|volume= 89|issue=5|pages= 484–498|author=Horak |doi=10.2522/ptj.20080071 |pmc=2676433|display-authors=etal |pmid=19329772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''BESS'''. The BESS (Balance Error Scoring System) is a commonly used way to assess balance. It is known as a  simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one’s postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5–7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with hands on hips and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper testing position for more than 5 seconds.

Concussion (or mild traumatic brain injury) have been associated with imbalance among sports participants and military personnel. Some of the standard balance tests may be too easy or time-consuming for application to these high-functioning groups, s. Expert recommendations have been gathered concerning balance assessments appropriate to military service-members.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D., Rupert, A. H., &amp; Legan, S. M. (2012).

==Quantitative (computerized) assessments==
Due to recent technological advances, a growing trend in balance assessments has become the monitoring of [[center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)]] (CoP), the reaction vector of center of mass on the ground, path length for a specified duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hof|year=2005|title=The condition for dynamic stability|journal=Journal of biomechanics|volume=38|pages=1–8|author2=A.L.|author3=Gazendam|author4=M.G.J|author5=Sinke|author6=W.E.|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.03.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; With quantitative assessments, minimal CoP path length is suggestive of good balance. Laboratory-grade force plates are considered the "gold-standard" of measuring CoP. The NeuroCom Balance Manager (NeuroCom, Clackamas, OR, United States) is a commercially available dynamic [[posturography]] system that uses computerized software to track CoP during different tasks. These different assessments range from the sensory organization test looking at the different systems that contribute through sensory receptor input to the limits of stability test observing a participant's ankle range of motion, velocity, and reaction time. While the NeuroCom is considered the industry standard for balance assessments, it does come at a steep price (about $250,000).

Within the past 5 years research has headed toward inexpensive and portable devices capable of measuring CoP accurately. Recently, Nintendo's Wii balance board (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) has been validated against a force plate and found to be an accurate tool to measure CoP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark |year=2010|title=Validity and reliability of the Nintendo Wii balance board for assessment of standing balance|journal= Gait &amp; Posture|volume= 31|issue=3|pages= 307–310|author2=R.|author3=Bryant|author4=A.|author5=Pua|author6=Y.|author7=McCrory|author8=P.|author9=Bennell|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2009.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very exciting as the price difference in technology ($25 vs $10,000) makes the Wii balance board a suitable alternative for clinicians to use quantitative balance assessments. Other inexpensive, custom-built force plates are being integrated into this new dynamic to create a growing field of research and clinical assessment that will benefit many populations.

==Fatigue's effect on balance==
The complexity of balance allows for many confounding variables to effect a person's ability to stay upright. [[Fatigue (medical)]], causing central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, can indirectly result in the inability to remain upright. This is seen repeatedly in clinical populations (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis). Another major concern regarding fatigue's effect on balance is in the athletic population. Balance testing has become a standard measure to help diagnose concussions in athletes, but due to the fact that athletes can be extremely fatigued has made it hard for clinicians to accurately determine how long the athletes need to rest before fatigue is gone, and they can measure balance to determine if the athlete is concussed. This can have devastating effects when looking at college and professional games where the athlete is depended upon by a community. So far, researchers have only been able to estimate that athletes need anywhere from 8–20 minutes of rest before testing balance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox|year=2008|title=Return of postural control to baseline after anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocols|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=43|issue=5|pages=456–63|author2=Z.G.|author3=Mihalik|author4=J.P.|author5=Blakburn|author6=J.T.|author7=Battaglini|author8=C.L.|author9=Guskiewicz|author10=KM|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-43.5.456|pmid=18833307|pmc=2547864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nardone|year=1997|title=Fatigue effects on body balance|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Electromyography and Motor Control|volume=105|issue=4|pages=309–320|author2=A|author3=Tarantola|author4=J|author5=Giordano|author6=A|author7=Schieppati|author8=M|doi=10.1016/S0924-980X(97)00040-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susco|year=2004|title=Balance recovers within 20 minutes after exertion as measured by the Balance Error Scoring System|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=39|issue=3|pages=241–246|author2=T.M.|author3=McLeod|author4=T.C.V.|author5=Gansneder|author6=B.M.|author7=Shultz|author8=S.J.|pmc=522146|pmid=15496993}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can be a huge difference depending on the circumstances.

==Other factors influencing balance==
Age, gender,{{how|date=August 2014}} and height have all been shown to impact an individual’s ability to balance and the assessment{{by whom|date=August 2014}} of that balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Typically, older adults have more body sway with all testing conditions.&lt;ref name="Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke| year=1995| title=Age and gender effects on postural control measures| journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation| volume=76 | pages=961–965 | doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(95)80075-1|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that older adults demonstrate shorter functional reach and larger body sway path lengths. Height also influences body sway in that as height increases, functional reach typically decreases.  However, this test is only a measure of anterior and posterior sway.  This is done to create a repeatable and reliable clinical balance assessment tool.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Pamela W., et al. (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Duncan, Pamela W.| year=1990| title=Functional reach: a new clinical measure of balance| journal=Journal of Gerontology| volume=45 | pages=192–197 | doi=10.1093/geronj/45.6.M192|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Cochrane Review found that specific types of exercise (such as gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercises; 3D exercises [e.g. Tai Chi] and combinations of these) can help improve balance in older adults. However, there was no or limited evidence on the effectiveness of general physical activities, such as walking and cycling, computer-based balance games and vibration plates.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Voluntary control of balance ==
While balance is mostly an automatic process, voluntary control is common. Active control usually takes place when a person is in a situation where balance is compromised. This can have the counter-intuitive effect of increasing postural sway during basic activities such as standing. One explanation for this effect is that conscious control results in over-correcting an instability and "may inadvertently disrupt relatively automatic control processes."{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} While concentration on an external task "promotes the utilization of more automatic control processes."&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"/&gt;

==Balance and dual-tasking==
Supra-postural tasks are those activities that rely on postural control while completing another behavioral goal, such as walking or creating a text message while standing upright. Research has demonstrated that postural stability operates to permit the achievement of other activities.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoffregen T. |author2=Pagulayan R. |author3=Bardy B. |author4=Hettinger L. | year = 2000 | title = Modulating postural control to facilitate visual performance | url = | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 203–20 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(00)00009-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, standing in a stable upright position is not at all beneficial if one falls as soon as any task is attempted.  In a healthy individual, it is believed that postural control acts to minimize the amount of effort required (not necessarily to minimize sway), while successfully accomplishing the supra-postural task.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"/&gt;  Research has shown that spontaneous reductions in postural sway occur in response to the addition of a secondary goal.&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"&gt;"McNevin, N., Wulf, G. (2002)"{{cite journal|author=McNevin, N. |author2=Wulf, G.| year=2002| title=Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control| journal=Human Movement Science| volume=21 | pages=187–202| doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNevin and Wulf (2002) found an increase in postural performance when directing an individual’s attention externally compared to directing attention internally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNevin N. |author2=Wulf G. | year = 2002 | title = Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control | url = | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 187–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, focusing attention on the effects of one’s movements rather than on the movement itself will boost performance.  This results from the use of more automatic and reflexive control processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013" /&gt;  When one is focused on their movements (internal focus), they may inadvertently interfere with these automatic processes, decreasing their performance.  Externally focusing attention improves postural stability, despite increasing postural sway at times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It is believed that utilizing automatic control processes by focusing attention externally enhances both performance and learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Adopting an external focus of attention subsequently improves the performance of supra-postural tasks, while increasing postural stability.&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McNevin | first1 = N. | last2 = Weir | first2 = P. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1080/02701367.2013.762321 | title = Effects of Attentional Focus and Age on Suprapostural Task Performance and Postural Control | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 96–103 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23611013| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heredity==

{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
Although there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.&lt;ref name="Expert09" /&gt; The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary ("sporadic cancers"). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A [[cancer syndrome]] or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.

Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in [[tumor suppressor genes]] that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of [[DNA repair|DNA repair genes]], [[oncogenes]] and [[Angiogenesis|genes involved in the production of blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson S | title = Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University.

==Physical and chemical agents==
{{Further|Carcinogen|Smoking and cancer|Safety of electronic cigarettes}}Particular substances, known as [[carcinogens]], have been linked to specific types of cancer. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke.

The relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries.

In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Nutri06" /&gt; Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Individuals who underwent [[bariatric surgery]] for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt;

There is an associated between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alzahrani B, Iseli TJ, Hebbard LW | title = Non-viral causes of liver cancer: does obesity led inflammation play a role? | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 345 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–9 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24007864 | doi = 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.08.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones ([[estrogens]], [[androgens]] and [[progestogens]]).&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Adipose tissue also creates an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert CA, Slingerland JM | title = Cytokines, obesity, and cancer: new insights on mechanisms linking obesity to cancer risk and progression | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–57 | date = 2013-01-14 | pmid = 23121183 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-121211-091527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on [[immune system]] and [[endocrine system]].&lt;ref name="Nutri06" /&gt;  More than half of the effect from diet is due to [[overnutrition]] rather than from eating too little healthy foods.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt;

==Hormones==
[[File:Breast cancer gross appearance.jpg|thumb|Macroscopic appearance of invasive [[ductal carcinoma]] of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.]]
Some [[hormone]]s play a role in the development of cancer by promoting [[cell growth|cell proliferation]].&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20759/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Henderson BE, Bernstein L, Ross RK|publisher=B.C.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of [[testosterone]] than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the [[selective estrogen-receptor modulator]] [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitors]], now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.

There is evidence that [[inflammation]] itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taniguchi K, Karin M|date=February 2014|title=IL-6 and related cytokines as the critical lynchpins between inflammation and cancer|journal=Seminars in Immunology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=54–74|doi=10.1016/j.smim.2014.01.001|pmid=24552665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic inflammation can lead to DNA damage over time and the accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colotta F, Allavena P, Sica A, Garlanda C, Mantovani A | title = Cancer-related inflammation, the seventh hallmark of cancer: links to genetic instability | journal = Carcinogenesis | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1073–81 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19468060 | doi = 10.1093/carcin/bgp127 | url = https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/30/7/1073/2477107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogensis and migration of cancer cells by influencing [[tumor microenvironment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mantovani A | title = Molecular pathways linking inflammation and cancer | journal = Current Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–73 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20455855 | url = http://www.eurekaselect.com/71752/article }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers.&lt;ref name="WHO_2014" /&gt;

== Radiation ==
{{main|Radiation-induced cancer}}
Up to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both [[non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] radiation and [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a [[chromosome]], it can break the chromosome, result in an [[aneuploidy|abnormal number of chromosomes]], inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause [[chromosome translocation]]s, or cause other types of [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/|title=Cancer medicine|author=Little JB|publisher=B.C. Decker|year=2000|isbn=1-55009-113-1|veditors=Kufe DW, Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast RC, Gansler TS, Holland JF, Frei E|edition= 6th|location=Hamilton, Ont|chapter=Chapter 14: Ionizing Radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if [[tumor suppressor gene]]s were damaged by the radiation.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation: morphological changes to the cell, acquiring [[cellular immortality]] (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Even if the radiation particle does not strike the DNA directly, it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

===  Non-ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Squamous cell carcinoma (3).jpg|thumb|Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.]]Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energey to break [[chemical bonds]]. Non-ionizing [[radio frequency]] radiation from [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric power transmission]], and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones|title=Cell Phones and Cancer Risk - National Cancer Institute|date=2013-05-08|publisher=Cancer.gov|access-date=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in sunlight), [[x-rays]], and [[gamma radiation]], generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name="Cleaver"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20854/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL|publisher=B.C. Decker|year=2000|isbn=1-55009-113-1|veditors=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE|edition= 5th|location=Hamilton, Ontario|chapter=15. Ultraviolet Radiation Carcinogenesis|oclc=|access-date=31 January 2011|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave [[UVB]], as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

===  Ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Meningioma.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.]]Sources of ionizing radiation include [[medical imaging]], and [[radon]] gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation-induced [[meningiomas]] are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamanaka R, Hayano A, Kanayama T | title = Radiation-Induced Meningiomas: An Exhaustive Review of the Literature | journal = World Neurosurgery | volume = 97 | pages = 635–644.e8 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27713063 | doi = 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Ionizing radiation is also used in some kinds of [[medical imaging]]. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. [[Nuclear medicine]] techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. [[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.&lt;ref name="pmid18046031"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner DJ, Hall EJ | title = Computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 22 | pages = 2277–84 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18046031 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]], are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

==Rare causes==
*

===  Organ transplantation ===
[[File:Metastatic malignant melanoma, heart.jpg|thumb|Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.]]
The development of donor-derived tumors from [[organ transplants]] is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.&lt;ref name="pmid16957717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dingli D, Nowak MA | title = Cancer biology: infectious tumour cells | journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = 7107 | pages = 35–6 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957717 | pmc = 2711443 | doi = 10.1038/443035a | bibcode = 2006Natur.443...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barozzi P, Luppi M, Facchetti F, Mecucci C, Alù M, Sarid R, Rasini V, Ravazzini L, Rossi E, Festa S, Crescenzi B, Wolf DG, Schulz TF, Torelli G | title = Post-transplant Kaposi sarcoma originates from the seeding of donor-derived progenitors | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 554–61 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12692543 | doi = 10.1038/nm862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Trauma ===
Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20784/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Gaeta JF|publisher=B.C. Decker|year=2000|isbn=1-55009-113-1|veditors=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE|edition= 5th|location=Hamilton, Ontario|chapter=Chapter 17: Trauma and Inflammation|oclc=|access-date=27 January 2011|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by [[kanger]] and kairo heaters (charcoal [[hand warmer]]s), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.

=== Maternal-fetal transmission ===
In the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of [[acute leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[melanoma]] and [[carcinoma]] from mother to fetus has been observed.&lt;ref name="Tolar"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolar J, Neglia JP | title = Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–4 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12794519 | doi = 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]]. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] [[histocompatibility|incompatibility]].&lt;ref name="Tolar" /&gt; In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1405">'''Cervical effacement''' (also called '''cervical ripening'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/effacement.html American Pregnancy Association on effacement]&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to a thinning of the cervix. It is a component of the [[Bishop score]].

It can be expressed as a percentage.&lt;ref name="pmid2047066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holcomb WL, Smeltzer JS |title=Cervical effacement: variation in belief among clinicians |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=43–5 |date=July 1991 |pmid=2047066 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to effacement, the cervix is like a long bottleneck, usually about four centimeters in length. Throughout [[pregnancy]], the cervix is tightly closed and protected by a plug of [[mucus]]. When the cervix effaces, the mucus plug is loosened and passes out of the [[vagina]]. The mucus may be tinged with [[blood]] and the passage of the mucus plug is called [[bloody show]] (or simply "show"). As effacement takes place, the cervix then shortens, or effaces, pulling up into the uterus and becoming part of the lower uterine wall. Effacement may be measured in percentages, from zero percent (not effaced at all) to 100 percent, which indicates a paper-thin cervix. Effacement is accompanied by [[cervical dilation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5389">A '''chemical accident''' is the unintentional release of one or more hazardous substances which could harm human health or the environment.  '''[[Chemical hazard]]s''' are systems where chemical accidents could occur under certain circumstances. Such events include fires, [[explosion]]s, [[leak]]ages or release of [[Toxin|toxic]] or [[hazardous material]]s that can 
cause people illness, injury, or disability. 

While chemical accidents may occur whenever toxic materials are stored, [[transport]]ed or used, the most severe accidents are [[industrial accident]]s, involving major [[chemical manufacturing]] and storage facilities. The most significant chemical accident in recorded history was the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in [[India]], in which more than 3,000 people had died after a highly toxic [[vapour]], ([[methyl isocyanate]]), was released at a [[Union Carbide]] [[Pesticide]]s factory.'''

Efforts to prevent accidents range from improved [[safety]] systems to fundamental changes in [[chemical]] use and manufacture, referred to as primary prevention or inherent safety.

In the [[United States]], concern about chemical accidents after the Bhopal disaster led to the passage of the 1986 [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]]. The EPCRA requires local [[emergency]] planning efforts throughout the country, including emergency notifications. The law also requires companies to make publicly available information about their storage of toxic chemicals. Based on such information, citizens can identify the vulnerable zones in which severe toxic releases could cause harm or death.

In 1990, the [[Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] was established by [[United States Congress|Congress]], though the CSB did not become operational until 1998. The Board's mission is to determine the root causes of chemical accidents and issue safety recommendations to prevent future Safety Performance Indicators. It also organizes workshops on a number of issues related to preparing for, preventing, and responding to chemical accidents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34369_1_1_1_1_37465,00.html Chemical Accidents: About]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531162320/http://www.oecd.org/about/0%2C3347%2Cen_2649_34369_1_1_1_1_37465%2C00.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}." OECD Environment Directorate. OECD. 19 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], incidents such as the [[Flixborough disaster]] and the [[Seveso disaster]] led to legislation such as the [[Directive 96/82/EC|Seveso Directive]] and Seveso planning and provide for safety reports to local authorities. Many countries have organisations that can assist with substance risk assessment and emergency planning that is required by a wide variety of [[legislation]], such as the [[National Chemical Emergency Centre]] in the [[UK]], [[Brandweerinformatiecentrum voor gevaarlijke stoffen]]/Fire service information centre for dangerous goods in [[Belgium]]. 

In the UK, the [[UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]] publishes reports of accidents on its [[web site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crhf.org.uk/|title=UK Chemical Reaction Hazard Forum Home |first=Dr. Ron|last=Jones|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These accidents were, at the time, minor in nature, but they could have escalated into major accidents.  It is hoped that publishing these incidents will prevent "Re-inventing the Wheel".  At present, (Dec 2008), there are over 140 articles on the web site.

'''Diseases of poverty''' (also known as '''poverty related diseases''') is the term used to describe diseases that are more prevalent in the low-income population. It includes infectious diseases as well as diseases related to malnutrition and poor health behaviors. Poverty is one of the social determinants of health. The World Health Report, 2002 states that diseases of poverty account for 45% of the disease burden in the countries with high poverty rate which are preventable or treatable with exciting interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/|title=World Health Report, 2002|last=World Health organization(WHO)|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases of poverty are often [[co-morbid]] and ubiquitous with malnutrition.&lt;ref name= primary&gt;Singh, A. R., &amp; Singh, S. A. (2008). Diseases of Poverty and Lifestyle, Well-Being and Human Development. Mens Sana Monographs, 6(1), 187-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty and diseases are a ramification of each other. Poverty increases chances of having these diseases as the deprivation of safe shelter, drinking water and food, poor sanitation, lack of knowledge and access to health services contributes towards poor health behaviors which often results into diseases of poverty. At the same time, these diseases act as a barrier for economic growth to affected people and families caring for them which in turn results into increased poverty in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, J. (2008), The end of poverty: economic possibilities for our time. European Journal of Dental Education, 12: 17-21. doi:10.1111/j.1600-0579.2007.00476.x&lt;/ref&gt;

These diseases triggered in part by poverty are in contrast to so-called "[[diseases of affluence]]", which are diseases thought to be a result of increasing wealth in a society.

==Contributing factors==
For many environmental and social factors, including poor housing conditions and poor working conditions, inadequate [[sanitation]], and disproportionate occupation as [[sex worker]]s, the poor are more likely to be exposed to [[infectious disease]]s.  Malnutrition, mental stress, overwork, inadequate knowledge, and minimal health care can hinder recovery and exacerbate the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Health and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch5/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Malnutrition]] is associated with 54% of childhood deaths from diseases of poverty, and lack of skilled attendants during childbirth is primarily responsible for the high maternal and infant death rates among the poor.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;[http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/en/ WHO | Ensuring skilled care for every birth.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206064523/http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/en/|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mdg/goals/goal4/en/index.html WHO | Goal 4: reduce child mortality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820005648/http://www.who.int/mdg/goals/goal4/en/index.html |date=August 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contaminated water===
Each year many children and adults die as a result of a lack of access to [[clean drinking water]] and poor sanitation. Many poverty related diseases such as diarrhea acquire and spread as a result of inadequate access to clean drinking water.  According to UNICEF, 3,000 children die every day, worldwide due to contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation.&lt;ref name=unicef&gt;[http://www.unicefusa.org/work/water/ UNICEF (Water).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409005419/http://www.unicefusa.org/work/water/ |date=April 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people who did not have access to clean water by 2015, was reached five years ahead of schedule in 2010, there are still 783 million people who rely on unimproved water sources.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; In 2010 the United Nations declared access to clean water a fundamental human right, integral to the achievement of other rights.  This made it enforceable and justifiable to permit governments to ensure their populations access to clean water.&lt;ref name= water1&gt;Singh, Nandita, Per Wickenberg, Karsten Åström, and Håkan Hydén. 2012. "Accessing water through a rights-based approach: problems and prospects regarding children." Water Policy 14, no. 2: 298-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Though access to water has improved for some, it continues to be especially difficult for women and children.  Women and girls bear most of the burden for accessing water and supplying it to their households.

In [[Women in India|India]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and parts of Latin America, women are required to travel long distances in order to access a clean water source and then bring some water home. This has a significant impact on girls’ educational attainment.&lt;ref name=water1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Access to Clean Water and Sanitation Pose 21st-Century Challenge for Millions" ''JAMA'' 2004;292(3) 318-320. {{DOI|10.1001/jama.292.3.318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been further efforts to improve water quality using new technology which allows water to be disinfected immediately upon collection and during the storage process.  Clean water is necessary for cooking, cleaning, and laundry because many people come into contact with disease causing pathogens through their food, or while bathing or washing.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, E., Reiff, F., &amp; Tauxe, R. (1995). Safe water treatment and storage in the home. A practical new strategy to prevent waterborne disease. JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 273(12), 948-953.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Flint water crisis|ongoing issue of contaminated water in the United States]] has been taking place in [[Flint, Michigan]]. On September 4, 2018, evidence of E Coli and other organisms that can cause disease were found in the water. The issue of contaminated water in Flint, Michigan started when the source for drinking water in Flint was  changed from the Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the very cheap Flint River.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Inadequate sanitation ===
Contaminated water and inadequate sanitation are related to diseases of poverty such as malaria, [[parasitic disease]]s, and [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common water and sanitation-related diseases |year=2005 |work= |publisher=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/index_wes_related.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infections act as cofactors that increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;

Standpipes and sanitation are provided in most developing areas, but the death rates are not significantly reduced. One of the reasons that water-related diseases are still occurring is because water supplies can be contacted by contaminated surface water. To effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality of diseases, the population should get access to water from home instead from outside. Therefore, in addition to the installation of standpipes, water supplies and sanitation should be provided within houses.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Julia A., and Kenneth S. Warren. 1980. Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part C: Medical Economics 14 (2):145-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor nutrition===
Malnutrition disproportionately affect those in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 35 percent of children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa show physical signs of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Piwoz00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PNACK673.pdf|title=HIV/AIDS and Nutrition: A Review of the Literature and Recommendations for Nutritional Care and Support in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=December 2000|publisher=Academy for Educational Development|location=Washington DC|format=PDF|id=PN-ACK-673|author1=Piwoz, Ellen G. |author2=Preble, Elizabeth A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition, the immune system, and infectious diseases operate in a cyclical manner: infectious diseases have deleterious effects on nutritional status, and nutritional deficiencies can lower the strength of the immune system which affects the body’s ability to resist infections.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt; Similarly, malnutrition of both [[macronutrients]] (such as [[protein]] and [[energy]]) and [[micronutrients]] (such as [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[vitamins]]) increase susceptibility to HIV infections by interfering with the immune system and through other biological mechanisms. Depletion of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients promotes [[viral replication]] that contributes to greater risks of HIV transmission from mother-to-child as well as those through sexual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friis H, Michaelsen KF |title=Micronutrients and HIV infection: a review |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=157–63 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9537299 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased mother-to-child transmission is related to specific deficiencies in micro-nutrients such as vitamin A.&lt;ref name=Semba94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nimmagadda A, O'Brien WA, Goetz MB |title=The significance of vitamin A and carotenoid status in persons infected by the human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Clin.

HIV infection can affect the production of hormones that interfere with the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt;

In the United States, 11.1 percent of households struggle with food insecurity.&lt;ref name=food&gt;Chilton, M. (2009). A Rights-Based Approach to Food Insecurity in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 99(7), 1203.&lt;/ref&gt;   Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to quality food for a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name= food /&gt;  The rate of hunger and malnutrition in female headed households was three times the national average at 30.2 percent. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 10 percent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean are affected by hunger and malnutrition.&lt;ref name="hunger"&gt;[http://www.fao.org Freeing Latin America and the Caribbean from hunger]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918232726/http://www.fao.org/ |date=September 18, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poor housing conditions ===
Quality and affordability of housing are one of the major concerns in public health. Poor housing conditions can be described as leaks, molds, indoor air pollutant, overcrowding, hazardous structures, affordability of home heating, and poor ergonomics. Housing insecurities are very common among the poor. It is often associated with infectious diseases, lead exposure, injuries, and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, J., &amp; Higgins, D. L. (2002). Housing and health: time again for public health action. ''American journal of public health'', ''92''(5), 758-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of access to health services ===
According to WHO, medical strategies report, approximately 30% of the global population does not have regular access to exciting medicines. In the poorest parts of Africa and Asia, this percent goes up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, Medicines Strategy Report 2002–2003&lt;/ref&gt; The population below the poverty line lacks access due to higher retail price and unavailability of the medicines. The higher cost can be due to the higher manufacturing price or due to local or regional tax and Value Added Tax. There is a significant disparity in the research conducted in the health sector. It is claimed that only 10% of the health research conducted globally focuses on 90% disease burden. However, diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases etc that traditionally were associated with the wealthier community are now becoming more prevalent in the poor communities as well. Hence, the research conducted now is relevant to poor population.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt; Political priority is also one of the contributing factors of inaccessibility. The government of poor countries may allocate less funding to public health due to the scarcity of resources.

==Diseases==
Together, diseases of poverty kill approximately 14 million people annually.{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref name="results.org"/&gt;  [[Gastroenteritis]] with its associated [[diarrhea]] results in about 1.8&amp;nbsp;million deaths in children yearly with most of these in the world's poorest nations.&lt;ref name=M93&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L.

At the global level, the three primary PRDs are tuberculosis, AIDS/HIV and malaria.&lt;ref name="wpro.who.int"&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm WHO/WPRO-Poverty Issues Dominate RCM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403044412/http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developing countries]] account for 95% of the global AIDS prevalence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=HIV/AIDS and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 98% of active tuberculosis infections.&lt;ref name="results.org"&gt;[http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 RESULTS: World Health/Diseases of Poverty.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703171704/http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 90% of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/372/RBMInfosheet_1.htm Roll Back Malaria Partnership: What is malaria?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423085034/http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/372/RBMInfosheet_1.htm |date=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these three diseases account for 10% of global [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name="wpro.who.int"/&gt;

Treatable childhood diseases are another set which have disproportionately higher rates in poor countries despite the availability of cures for decades. These include [[measles]], [[pertussis]] and [[polio]].&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf |title=Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 gap |author=Stevens, Philip |date=November 2004 |publisher=International Policy Network |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest three poverty-related diseases (PRDs)  — [[AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] — account for 18% of diseases in poor countries.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt; The disease burden of treatable childhood diseases in high-mortality, poor countries is 5.2% in terms of [[disability-adjusted life year]]s but just 0.2% in the case of advanced countries.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt;

In addition, [[infant mortality]] and [[maternal mortality]] are far more prevalent among the poor. For example, 98% of the 11,600 daily maternal and [[neonate|neonatal]] deaths occur in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Three other diseases, [[measles]], [[pneumonia]], and [[diarrheal diseases]], are also closely associated with poverty, and are often included with AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in broader definitions and discussions of diseases of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090703171704/http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 World Health/Diseases of Poverty.] Retrieved 05 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglected diseases===
{{main|Neglected tropical diseases}}
Based upon the spread of research in cures for diseases, certain diseases are identified and referred to as "[[neglected tropical diseases|neglected diseases]]". These include the following diseases:&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;
*[[African trypanosomiasis]]
*[[Chagas disease]]
*[[Leishmaniasis]]
*[[Lymphatic filariasis]]
*[[Dracunculiasis]] (“[[Guinea worm]] disease”)
*[[Onchocerciasis]]
*[[Schistosomiasis]]
*[[Trichomoniasis]]

Tropical diseases such as these tend to be neglected in research and development efforts. Of 1393 new drugs brought into use over a period of 25 years (1975–1999), only a total of thirteen, less than 1%, related to these diseases. Of 20 MNC drug companies surveyed for research on PRDs, only two had projects targeted towards these neglected PRDs. However, the combined total number of deaths due to these diseases is dwarfed by the enormous number of patients affected by PRDs such as respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea and tuberculosis, besides many others.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;
Similar to the spread of tropical neglected diseases in developing nations, these neglected infections disproportionately affect poor and minority populations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hotez PJ (2008) Neglected Infections of Poverty in the United States of America.PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2(6):e256.doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000256&lt;/ref&gt;  These diseases have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as priorities for [[public health]] action based on the number of people infected, the severity of the illnesses, and the ability to prevent and treat them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi.html Centers For Disease Control.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091447/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi.html |date=May 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trichomoniasis====
Trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. It is especially prevalent among young, poor and African American women.  This infection is also common in poor communities in Sub-Saharan Africa and impoverished parts of Asia. This neglected infection is one of special concern because it is associated with a heightened risk for contracting HIV and pre-term deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, H., Jamieson, D. J., Hogan, J. W., Anderson, J., Klein, R. S., Susan, C., &amp; Paula, S. (2002). Prevalence, Incidence, and Persistence or Recurrence of Trichomoniasis among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Positive Women and among HIV-Negative Women at High Risk for HIV Infection" ''Clinical Infectious Diseases'' 34(10), 1406-1411.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, availability of cures and recent advances in medicine have led to only three diseases being considered neglected diseases, namely, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;

===Malaria===
Africa accounts for a majority of [[malaria]] infections and deaths worldwide. Over 80 percent of the 300 to 500 million malaria infections occurring annually worldwide are in Africa.&lt;ref name= malaria&gt;Crosse, M. (2005). Global malaria control [electronic resource] : U.S. and multinational investments and implementation challenges. Washington, DC : [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]], [2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, about one million children under the age of five die from malaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/tdt/diseases/malaria/diseaseinfo.htm Malaria.

===Intestinal parasites===
[[Intestinal parasites]] are extremely prevalent in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; These include [[hookworms]], [[roundworms]], and other [[amoebas]]. They can aggravate malnutrition by depleting essential nutrients through intestinal [[blood loss]] and chronic [[diarrhea]].

===Schistosomiasis===
[[Schistosomiasis]] (bilharzia) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasitic flatworm [[trematodes]]. Moreover, more than 80 percent of the 200 million people worldwide who have schistosomiasis live in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO04Schisto&gt;[http://www.who.int/tdt/diseases/schisto/diseaseinfo.htm Schistosomiasis.

===Tuberculosis===
[[Tuberculosis]] is the leading cause of death around the world for an infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;Tuberculosis: Commentary on a Reemergent Killer. Barry R. Bloom and Christopher J. L. Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; This disease is especially prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Latin American and Caribbean region.  While the tuberculosis rate is decreasing in the rest of the world, it is increasing by rate of 6 percent per year in Sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the leading cause of death for people with HIV in Africa. Tuberculosis (TB) is closely related to lifestyles of poverty, overcrowded conditions, alcoholism, stress, drug addiction and malnutrition.   This disease spreads quickly among people who are undernourished.&lt;ref name= primary/&gt; According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, tuberculosis is more prevalent among foreign born persons, and ethnic minorities.  The rates are especially high among Hispanics, Blacks and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Morbidity and Mortality Report. March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
HIV infection and TB are also closely tied.  Being infected with HIV increases the rate of activation of latent TB infections, and having TB, increases the rate of HIV replication, therefore accelerating the progression of AIDS.&lt;ref name= primary/&gt;

Many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are ravaged with poverty and many people live on less than one United States dollar a day.&lt;ref name= Stillwaggon&gt;Elieen Stillwaggon, Aids and the Ecology of Poverty. Oxford University Press. New York&lt;/ref&gt; The poverty in these countries gives rise to many other factors that explain the high prevalence of AIDS. The poorest people in most African countries suffer from malnutrition, lack of access to clean water, and have improper sanitation.  Because of a lack of clean water many people are plagued by intestinal parasites that significantly increase their chances of contracting HIV due to compromised immune system.  Malaria, a disease still rampant in Africa also increases the risk of contracting HIV.  These parasitic diseases, affect the body’s immune response to HIV, making people more susceptible to contracting the disease once exposed.  Genital schistosomiasis, also prevalent in the topical areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and many countries worldwide, produces genital lesions and attract CD4 cells to the genital region which promotes HIV infection.  All these factors contribute to the high rate of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of the factors seen in Africa are also present in Latin America and the Caribbean and contribute to the high rates of infections seen in those regions.  In the United States, poverty is a contributing factor to HIV infections.  [[Race and health in the United States|There is also a large racial disparity]], with African Americans having a significantly higher rate of infection than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name= Stillwaggon/&gt;

===Asthma===
More than 300 million people worldwide have [[asthma]]. The rate of asthma increases as countries become more urbanized and in many parts of the world those who develop asthma do not have access to medication and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ginasthma.org/reports-global-burden-of-asthma.html "Global Burden of Asthma."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524032919/http://www.ginasthma.org/reports-global-burden-of-asthma.html |date=May 24, 2012 }} Matthew Masoli, Denise Fabian, Shaun Holt, Richard Beasley.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Though [[heart disease]] is not exclusive to the poor, there are aspects of a life of poverty that contribute to its development.  This category includes [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]].  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and there are disparities of morbidity between the rich and poor.  Studies from around the world link heart disease to poverty. Low neighborhood income and education were associated with higher risk factors.   Poor diet, lack of exercise and limited (or no) access to a specialist were all factors related to poverty, though to contribute to heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;John Yinger, Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation.  Understanding Poverty. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Both low income and low education were predictors of coronary heart disease, a subset of cardiovascular disease.  Of those admitted to hospital in the United States for heart failure, women and African Americans were more likely to reside in lower income neighborhoods.  In the developing world, there is a 10 fold increase in cardiac events in the black and urban populations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, G., &amp; Carrington, M. (2007). "Tackling heart disease and poverty."

===Obstetrical fistula===
[[Obstetric fistula]] or vaginal fistula is a medical condition in which a [[fistula]] (hole) develops between either the [[rectum]] and [[vagina]] (see [[rectovaginal fistula]]) or between the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and vagina (see [[vesicovaginal fistula]]) after severe or failed [[childbirth]], when adequate medical care is not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creanga|first=A.

===Dental decay===
Dental decay or [[dental caries]] is the gradual destruction of tooth enamel.  Poverty is a significant determinant for oral health.&lt;ref&gt;DYE, B. (2010). Trends in Oral Health by Poverty Status as Measured by Healthy People 2010 Objectives. Public Health Reports, 125(6), 817.&lt;/ref&gt; Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide.  In the United States it is the most common chronic disease of childhood.

==Consequences==
Diseases of poverty reflect the dynamic relationship between poverty and poor health; while such diseases result directly from poverty, they also perpetuate and deepen impoverishment by sapping personal and national health and financial resources. For example, malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations, and by killing tens of millions in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS alone threatens “the economies, social structures, and political stability of entire societies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm |title=Roll Back Malaria Partnership: Economic costs of malaria |publisher=Rbm.who.int |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108065231/http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/page2.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=Unfpa.org |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For women===
Women and children are often put at a high risk of being infected by schistosomiasis, which in turn puts them at a higher risk of acquiring HIV.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Since the mode of schistosomiasis transmission is usually through contaminated water in streams and lakes, women and children who do their household chores by the water are more likely to acquire the disease. Activities that women and children often do around waterfront include washing clothes, collecting water, bathing, and swimming.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO04Schisto/&gt; Women who have schistosomiasis lesions are three times more likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=Kjetland06&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kjetland EF |title=Association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV in rural Zimbabwean women |journal=AIDS |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=593–600 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16470124 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Ndhlovu PD |author3=Gomo E |display-authors=3 |last4=Mduluza |first4=Takafira |last5=Midzi |first5=Nicholas |last6=Gwanzura |first6=Lovemore |last7=Mason |first7=Peter R |last8=Sandvik |first8=Leiv |last9=Friis |first9=Henrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also have a higher risk of HIV transmission through the use of medical equipment such as needles.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Because more women than men use health services, especially during pregnancy, they are more likely to come across unsterilized needles for injections.&lt;ref name=Gisselquist03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kjetland06/&gt; Although statistics estimate that unsterilized needles only account for 5 to 10 percent of primary HIV infections, studies show this mode of HIV transmission may be higher than reported.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drucker E, Alcabes PG, Marx PA |title=The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9297 |pages=1989–92 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11747942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06967-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(01)06967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased risk of contracting HIV through non-sexual means has social consequences for women as well.

Presented April 2005 for the Consultation on Nutrition and HIV/AIDS in Africa: Evidence, lessons and recommendations for action.&lt;/ref&gt; This is crucial in parts of Africa where [[farming]] is the primary occupation and obtaining food is dependent on the agricultural outcome. Without adequate [[food production]], malnutrition becomes more prevalent. Children are often collateral damage in the AIDS crisis. As dependents, they can be burdened by the illness and eventual death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. Studies have shown that orphaned children are more likely to display physical symptoms of malnutrition than children whose parents are both alive.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt;

==Public policy proposals==

There are a number of proposals for reducing the diseases of poverty and eliminating health disparities within and between countries. The World Health Organization proposes closing the gaps by acting on social determinants.&lt;ref name= commission&gt;Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Closing the Gap in a Generation. World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Their first recommendation is to improve daily living conditions.  This area involves improving the lives of women and girls so that their children are born in healthy environments and placing an emphasis on early childhood health.  
Their second recommendation is to tackle the inequitable distribution of money, power and resources.  This would involve building stronger public sectors and changing the way in which society is organized.  
Their third recommendation is to measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action. This would involve training policy makers and healthcare practitioners to recognize problems and form policy solutions.&lt;ref name= commission/&gt; 

==== Health in All Policies ====
The 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion held in Helsinki in June 2013 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion (2014). ''Health in all policies: Helsinki statement. Framework for country action''. Helsinki, Finland: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed an approach termed Health in All Policies. Health inequalities are shaped by many powerful forces and social, political, and economic determinants. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that their people are able to live healthy lives and have equitable access to achieving a reasonable state of good health. Policies that governments craft and implement in all sectors have a significant and ongoing impact on public health, health equity, and the lives of their citizens. Increases in technology, medical innovation, and living conditions have led to the disappearance of diseases and other factors contributing to poor health. However, there are many diseases of poverty that still persist in developed and developing countries. Tackling these health inequalities and diseases of poverty requires a willingness to engage the whole government in health. The Helskinki Statement lays out a framework of action for countries and calls on governments to make a commitment to building health equity within their country. 

Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policies across all sectors of government that takes into account the health implications of all government and policy decisions to improve health equity across all populations residing within the borders of a country. This concept is built upon principles in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The United Nations Millennium Development Declaration, and principles of good governance &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: legitimacy given by national and international law, accountability of government, transparency of policy making, participation of citizens, sustainability ensuring policies meet the needs of both present and future generations, and collaboration across sectors and levels of government. 

Finally the Framework lists and expands upon six steps for implementation &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that may be undertaken by a country in taking action towards Health in All Policies. These are components of action and not a rigid checklist of steps to adhere to. The most important aspect of this policy is that governments should adapt the policy to suit the needs of their citizens, their socioeconomic situation, and their governance system.

# Establish the need and priorities for HiAP
# Frame planned action
# Identify supportive structures and processes
# Facilitate assessment and engagement
# Ensure monitoring, evaluation, and reporting
# Build capacity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS policy===
* Nutrition Supplements: Focusing on reversing the pattern of malnutrition in sub-Saharan African and other poor countries is a one possible way of decreasing susceptibility to HIV infections. Micro-nutrients such as iron and vitamin A can be delivered and provided at a very low cost. For example, vitamin A supplements cost $0.02 per capsule if provided twice a year. Iron supplements per child cost $0.02 if provided weekly or $0.08 if provided daily.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;
* Eliminating Co-factors: Tackling the very diseases that increase risk of HIV infections can help slow down the rates of HIV transmission. Co-factors such as malaria and parasitic infections can be combated in an effective and cost-efficient manner. For example, [[mosquito nets]] can be easily used to prevent malaria.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Parasites can be eliminated with medication that is cost-effective and easy to administer. Twice-yearly treatments range from $0.02 to $0.25 depending on the type of worm.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">In the [[mental health]] field, a '''dual relationship''' is a situation where multiple roles exist between a [[therapist]], or other mental health practitioner, and a client.&lt;ref name=Zur&gt;{{cite web|last=Zur|first=O.|title=Dual relationships, multiple relationships &amp; boundaries in psychotherapy, counseling &amp; mental health|url=http://www.zurinstitute.com/dualrelationships.html|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dual relationships are also referred to as '''multiple relationships''', and these two terms are used interchangeably in the research literature.&lt;ref name = Zur /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=M. B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice.|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]] (also referred to as the APA [[ethics code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Psychological Association|title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a resource that outlines ethical standards and principles to which practitioners are expected to adhere. Standard 3.05 of the APA ethics code outlines the definition of multiple relationships. Dual or multiple relationships occur when:

*a professional and personal relationship take place simultaneously between the psychologist and the client
* the psychologist has a relationship with a person closely related to or connected to their client
* the psychologist has intentions to enter into a future relationship with the client or someone closely related to the client

In addition, the standard provides a description of when to avoid multiple relationships (e.g., when the relationship causes harm to the client or impairs the psychologist's competence) and when these relationships are ''not'' considered unethical (e.g., when the relationship does not exploit the client or impair competence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=L.W.|author2=Battaglia, J. |author3=Epstein, R.S. |title=Frontier ethics: Mental health care needs and ethical dilemmas in rural communities|journal=[[Psychiatric Services]]|year=1999|volume=50|issue=4|pages=497–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=M.B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werth|first=J.L.|author2=Hastings, S.L. |author3=Riding-Malon, R. |title=Ethical challenges of practicing in rural areas|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=105–127|doi=10.1002/jclp.20681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Other Fields==
Several "helping" fields which are not strictly psychological in nature, but which still involve a therapeutic counseling environment, also have stringent policies involving dual relationships and the avoidance of such relationships. For example, the National Association of Social Workers [NASW], which regulates 132,000 social workers across the world, names multiple types of dual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics|url=http://socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers|page=Section 1.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes sexual, financial, personal or religious relationships which could become exploitative due to the differences in power between the worker and the client. Social workers are advised by the NASW to communicate with their clients when such a relationship arises or could arise, and are advised to take steps to avoid dual relationships wherever possible. The NASW recognizes, however, that dual relationships can be unavoidable in some types of communities, such as in rural communities or military installations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10059">'''Environment, health and safety''' ('''EHS''') is a discipline and specialty that studies and implements practical aspects of environmental protection and safety at work. In simple terms it is what organizations must do to make sure that their activities do not cause harm to anyone.

Regulatory requirements play an important role in EHS discipline and EHS managers must identify and understand relevant EHS regulations, the implications of which must be communicated to executive management  so the company can implement suitable measures. Organisations based in the United States are subject to EHS regulations in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], particularly CFR 29, 40, and 49. Still, EHS management is not limited to legal compliance and companies should be encouraged to do more than is required by law, if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Kavianian, Hamid R. "Occupational and Environmental Safety Engineering and Management", Van Norstrand Reinhold Company, New York (1990), {{ISBN|0-442-23822-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a '''health &amp; safety''' standpoint, it involves creating organized efforts and procedures for identifying workplace hazards and reducing accidents and exposure to harmful situations and substances. It also includes training of personnel in accident prevention, accident response, emergency preparedness, and use of protective clothing and equipment.

From an '''environmental''' standpoint, it involves creating a systematic approach to complying with environmental regulations, such as managing waste or air emissions all the way to helping site's reduce the company's carbon footprint.

Successful HSE programs also include measures to address ergonomics, [[air pollution|air quality]], and other aspects of workplace safety that could affect the health and well-being of employees and the overall community.

==History==

The [[chemical industry]] introduced the first formal [https://www.gensuite.com/ EHS management] approach in 1985 as a reaction to several catastrophic accidents (like the [[Seveso disaster]] of July 1976 and the [[Bhopal disaster]] of December 1984). This worldwide voluntary initiative, called "[[Responsible Care]]", started by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (formerly the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association - CCPA), operates in about 50 countries, with central coordination provided by the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA). It involves eight fundamental features which ensure plant and product safety, occupational health and environmental protection, but which also try to demonstrate by [[image-building]] campaigns that the chemical industry acts in a responsible manner. Being an initiative of the ICCA, it is restricted to the chemical industry.

Since the 1990s, general approaches to EHS management that may fit any type of organisation have appeared in international standards such as:

* the [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme]] (EMAS), developed by the [[European Commission]] in 1993
* [[ISO 14001]] for environmental management in 1996
* [[ISO 45001]] for occupational health and safety management in 2018, preceded by [[OHSAS 18001]] 1999

In 1998 the [[International Finance Corporation]] established EHS guidelines.

== Definition ==
For centuries, much of the flour milled for human consumption has been run through some kind of “bolting”, sifting or “extraction” process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hazen |first1=Theodore |title=Flour Bolting (Sifting) and Bolting Cloth |url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html |website=Mill Builder |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This flour is extracted from whole grains for one of two reasons; firstly, to decrease the [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|tendency for rancidity]].

Like the lower extraction white flour, higher extraction flour still creates a smoother dough more inclined to hold the gas created during fermentation. However, higher extraction flour also retains the sensory flavors and nutrition associated with the smaller bran and germ elements that are also extracted along with the endosperm.

== History ==
“White flour”, extracted from whole grains by [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller mills]] that eliminates the rancidity prone bran and germ elements of the wheat kernel was introduced in the late 19th century. By first hydrating the outer wheat kernel bran and germ elements to keep them intact, this new system then employed steel rollers instead of circulating stones to repetitively fracture the remaining starchy endosperm element into fine particles. The extracted endosperm flour came to be known as “white flour” as this element of the wheat kernel is white. This system ingeniously accomplished the extraction of most of the starchy endosperm while separating out virtually all of the bran and germ elements, extracting about 72% of the whole grain kernel. Roller milling eventually came (and continues) to dominate the world’s flour production. Well over 90% of U.S. flour production in 2017 was roller milled white enriched flour.   

Once roller milling made white flour affordable for almost everyone, public health issues arose.  As scientists learned more about the crucial health contributions of the bran and the germ, [[Enriched flour|artificial enrichment]] of white flour was introduced that restores a small part of the nutrition lost by eliminating all the bran and germ elements.

==Benefits==
There are generally two benefits from extraction:
#The highest extraction typically retains over 85% of the original volume by focusing on just improving functionality (increased loaf volume) without a significant sensory loss. A fine Whole Grain Flour is used to just remove the larger flour particles and is commonly referred to by Artisan bakers as High Extraction flour. It is primarily used to produce a variety of non-whole grain [[Bread|bread]] products.
#More aggressive sifting focuses on both functionality and reduction of the potential for rancidity by eliminating 100% of the bran and germ in the kernel.  This lower extraction (typically 72% or less) is most commonly [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller Milled White Enriched flour]] yielding a significant selection of flour types used for a variety of baking applications, the most significant of which is [[white bread]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David, ''Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War'', p. 179, Oxford University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|9780199832675}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Higher extraction flour ==
The general availability of refrigeration and even flour itself, has diminished the significance of the rancidity/shelf life/keeping quality issue of whole grain flour.   Higher extraction rates just focus on the elimination of the larger flour particles to increase loaf volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining the majority of the nutritional bran and germ elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Addendum to the Scott Mangold May 2015 Extraction Flour Baking Bench Test Comparative Flour Lab Analysis |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/comparative-flour-lab-analysis |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the endosperm.  This is accomplished by direct extraction of the fine whole grain flour output of [[Impact mill|impact or attrition mills]].  Millers have been able to match the finer particle size distribution of low extraction roller milled white flour (72% extraction) that eliminated all the bran and germ elements with a higher +88% extraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that retains most of them.

'''Foodborne illness''' (also '''foodborne disease''' and colloquially referred to as '''food poisoning''')&lt;ref&gt;
{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952820|food poisoning}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[illness]] resulting from the food spoilage of [[Food contaminant|contaminated food]], [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[parasite]]s that contaminate food,&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[toxin]]s such as [[poisonous mushrooms]] and various species of [[Bean#Toxins|beans that have not been boiled]] for at least 10 minutes.

Symptoms vary depending on the cause, and are described below in this article.  A few broad generalizations can be made, e.g.:  The [[incubation period]] ranges from hours to days, depending on the cause and on how much was consumed.  The incubation period tends to cause sufferers to not associate the symptoms with the item consumed, and so to cause sufferers to attribute the symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]] for example.

Symptoms often include vomiting, fever, and aches, and may include diarrhea. Bouts of vomiting can be repeated with an extended delay in between, because even if infected food was eliminated from the stomach in the first bout, [[microbe]]s (if applicable) can pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]] and begin to multiply. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade deeper body tissues.

==Causes==
{{see also|Pathogen}}
[[File:Foodinfridgetext.jpg|thumb|Poorly stored food in a refrigerator]]
Foodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or [[food storage]]. Good [[hygiene]] practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as [[food safety]]. Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;For foodborne illness caused by chemicals, see [[Food contaminants]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, foodborne illness can be caused by [[pesticide]]s or [[medicine]]s in food and natural toxic substances such as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]] or [[tetrodotoxin|reef fish]].

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are a common cause of foodborne illness. In the [[United Kingdom]] during 2000, the individual bacteria involved were the following: ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' 77.3%, ''[[Salmonella]]'' 20.9%, [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for [[norovirus]] and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins from bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. As a result, symptoms associated with intoxication are usually not seen until 12–72 hours or more after eating contaminated food. However, in some cases, such as Staphylococcal food poisoning, the onset of illness can be as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting contaminated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/staphylococcal.html |title=Staphylococcal Food Poisoning |accessdate=3 July 2016 |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
*''[[Campylobacter|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' which can lead to secondary [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] and [[periodontitis]]&lt;ref name=cazp&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 | pmid=17368847 | volume=117 | issue=3 | title=Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: a food production perspective |date=2007  |vauthors=Humphrey T, O'Brien S, Madsen M | pages=237–57 | journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]

Other common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:

==== Enterotoxins ====
{{see also|Botulism}}

In addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by [[enterotoxin]]s ([[exotoxin]]s targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom appearance varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, as in the case of enterotoxins of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in which symptoms appear in one to six hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-poisoning/DS00981/DSECTION=causes Food poisoning: Causes]. Mayo Clinic.&lt;/ref&gt; This causes intense [[vomiting]] including or not including diarrhea (resulting in [[staphylococcal enteritis]]), and staphylococcal enterotoxins (most commonly [[staphylococcal enterotoxin A]] but also including [[staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]) are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated.&lt;ref name=Staph&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Argudín MÁ, Mendoza MC, Rodicio MR |title=Food poisoning and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins |journal=Toxins (Basel) |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=1751–73 |date=2010 |pmid=22069659 |pmc=3153270 |doi=10.3390/toxins2071751 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs mainly in cooked and processed foods due to competition with other biota in raw foods, and humans are the main cause of contamination as a substantial percentage of humans are persistent carriers of ''S. aureus''.&lt;ref name=Staph/&gt; The CDC has estimated about 240,000 cases per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/pdf/5564.pdf Staphylococcus aureus: A Problem When Food Is Left Out Too Long]. Ohio State University Extension HYG-5564-11].&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''
*''[[Clostridium perfringens]]''
*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''

The rare but potentially deadly disease [[botulism]] occurs when the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' grows in improperly canned low-acid foods and produces [[botulin]], a powerful paralytic toxin.

''Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis'', certain species of [[Pseudomonas]] and [[Vibrio]], and some other bacteria, produce the lethal [[tetrodotoxin]], which is present in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of some living animal species rather than being a product of [[decomposition]].

====Emerging foodborne pathogens====
Many foodborne illnesses remain poorly understood.

*''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]'', ''Aeromonas caviae'', ''Aeromonas sobria''

====Preventing bacterial food poisoning====
[[File:Kingfish great south bay.jpg|thumb|Proper storage and [[refrigeration]] of [[food]] help in the prevention of food poisoning]]
Prevention is mainly the role of the state, through the definition of strict rules of [[hygiene]] and a [[public services]] of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] surveying of animal products in the food chain, from [[farming]] to the transformation industry and delivery (shops and [[restaurant]]s). This regulation includes:
* [[traceability]]: in a final product, it must be possible to know the origin of the ingredients (originating farm, identification of the harvesting or of the animal) and where and when it was processed; the origin of the illness can thus be tracked and solved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from the sale if a problem is detected;
* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as [[HACCP]] and the "[[cold chain]]";
* power of control and of law enforcement of [[veterinarian]]s.

In August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Phage therapy]] which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection. This has raised concerns, because without [[mandatory labelling]] consumers would not be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html |title=FDA Says Viruses Safe for Treating Meat |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825040502/http://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html|archivedate=August 25, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, prevention mainly consists of good [[food safety]] practices. Many forms of bacterial poisoning can be prevented by cooking it sufficiently, and either eating it quickly or refrigerating it effectively.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Many toxins, however, are not destroyed by heat treatment.

Techniques that help prevent food borne illness in the kitchen are hand washing, rinsing [[produce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2010/11/09/good-question-does-washing-fruit-do-anything/|title=Good Question: Does Washing Fruit Do Anything?|last=DeRusha|first=Jason|access-date=2016-09-18|date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing cross-contamination, proper storage, and maintaining cooking temperatures. In general, freezing or refrigerating prevents virtually all bacteria from growing, and heating food sufficiently kills parasites, viruses, and most bacteria. Bacteria grow most rapidly at the range of temperatures between {{convert|40|and|140|°F|°C}}, called the "danger zone". Storing food below or above the "danger zone" can effectively limit the production of toxins. For storing leftovers, the food must be put in shallow containers
for quick cooling and must be refrigerated within two hours. When food is reheated, it must reach an internal temperature of {{convert|165|F|C}} or until hot or steaming to kill bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/how-temperatures-affect-food/ct_index How Temperatures Affect Food]. U.D. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mycotoxins and alimentary mycotoxicoses ===
The term [[alimentary mycotoxicosis]] refers to the effect of poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s through food consumption.  The term mycotoxin is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops. Mycotoxins sometimes have important effects on human and animal health.  For example, an outbreak which occurred in the UK in 1960 caused the death of 100,000 turkeys which had consumed [[aflatoxin]]-contaminated peanut meal.  In the [[USSR]] in [[World War II]], 5,000 people died due to [[alimentary toxic aleukia]] (ALA).&lt;ref name=fam&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The common foodborne [[Mycotoxins]] include:
* [[Aflatoxin]]s – originating from ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]''. They are frequently found in tree nuts, peanuts, maize, sorghum and other oilseeds, including corn and cottonseeds. The pronounced forms of [[Aflatoxins]] are those of B1, B2, G1, and G2, amongst which Aflatoxin B1 predominantly targets the liver, which will result in [[necrosis]], [[cirrhosis]], and [[carcinoma]].&lt;ref name=afltx&gt;

===Viruses===
[[Virus|Viral]] infections make up perhaps one third of cases of food poisoning in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and [[Norwalk virus group|noroviruses]] are the most common foodborne illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004. Foodborne viral infection are usually of intermediate (1–3 days) [[incubation period]], causing illnesses which are self-limited in otherwise healthy individuals; they are similar to the bacterial forms described above.
* [[Enterovirus]]
* [[Hepatitis A]] is distinguished from other viral causes by its prolonged (2–6 week) [[incubation period]] and its ability to spread beyond the stomach and intestines into the [[liver]]. It often results in [[jaundice]], or yellowing of the skin, but rarely leads to chronic liver dysfunction. The virus has been found to cause infection due to the consumption of fresh-cut produce which has fecal contamination.&lt;ref name=ivcma&gt;

===Natural toxins===
Several foods can naturally contain [[toxins]], many of which are not produced by bacteria. Plants in particular may be toxic; animals which are naturally poisonous to eat are rare. In evolutionary terms, animals can escape being eaten by fleeing; plants can use only passive defenses such as poisons and distasteful substances, for example [[capsaicin]] in [[chili pepper]]s and pungent [[sulfur]] compounds in [[garlic]] and [[onion]]s. Most animal poisons are not synthesised by the animal, but acquired by eating poisonous plants to which the animal is immune, or by bacterial action.
* [[Alkaloid]]s
* [[Ciguatera poisoning]]
* [[Grayanotoxin]] ([[honey]] intoxication)
* [[Mushroom poisoning|Mushroom toxins]]
* [[Phytohaemagglutinin]] (red [[kidney bean]] poisoning; destroyed by boiling)
* [[Pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s
* Shellfish toxin, including [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, [[domoic acid|amnesic shellfish poisoning]] and [[ciguatera]] fish poisoning
* [[Scombrotoxin]]
* [[Tetrodotoxin]] ([[fugu fish]] poisoning)

Some plants contain substances which are toxic in large doses, but have therapeutic properties in appropriate dosages.
* [[Foxglove]] contains [[cardiac glycosides]].
* Poisonous hemlock ([[conium]]) has medicinal uses.

===Other pathogenic agents===
* [[Prion]]s, resulting in [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (CJD) and its variant (vCJD)

==="Ptomaine poisoning" {{anchor|ptomaine}}===
In 1883, the Italian, Professor Salmi, of Bologna, introduced the generic name ''{{linktext|ptomaine}}'' (from Greek ''ptōma'',  "fall, fallen body, corpse") for [[alkaloid]]s found in decaying animal and vegetable matter, especially (as reflected in their names) [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]].&lt;ref name="oed"
&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|date=1933|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|page=1557|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1892 ''Merck's Bulletin'' stated, "We name such products of bacterial origin ptomaines; and the special [[alkaloid]] produced by the [[Vibrio|comma bacillus]] is variously named Cadaverine, Putrescine, etc."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uEBYAAAAMAAJ ''Merck's Bulletin'', Volume 5], William Henry Porter, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''[[The Lancet]]'' stated, "The chemical ferments produced in the system, the... ptomaines which may exercise so disastrous an influence."&lt;ref&gt;Lancet, 3 Oct 1891, page 752&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the "disastrous... influence" is due to the direct action of [[bacteria]] and only slightly to the alkaloids. Thus, the use of the phrase "ptomaine poisoning" is now obsolete.

Tainted [[potato salad]] sickening hundreds at a [[Communist Party, USA|Communist]] political convention in [[Massillon, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/10618541/ "Report Next Week,"] ''Evening Independent'' (Massillon, OH), July 22, 1932, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and aboard a Washington DC cruise boat in separate incidents during a single week in 1932 drew national attention to the dangers of so-called "ptomaine poisoning" in the pages of the American news weekly, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].''&lt;ref&gt;"Medicine: Potato Salad," ''Time,'' August 1, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another newspaper article from 1944 told of more than 150 persons being hospitalized in Chicago with ptomaine poisoning apparently from [[rice pudding]] served by a chain of restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poisoning Hits 150 in Chicago|url=http://ken.stparchive.com/Archive/KEN/KEN05271944p01.php|work=Kenosha Evening News|date=May 27, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Incubation period===
The delay between the consumption of contaminated food and the appearance of the first [[symptom]]s of illness is called the [[incubation period]]. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely months or even years, such as in the case of [[listeriosis]] or [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.

The long incubation period of many foodborne illnesses tends to cause sufferers to attribute their symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]].

During the incubation period, [[microbe]]s pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]], attach to the [[cell (biology)|cells]] lining the intestinal walls, and begin to multiply there. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade the deeper body tissues. The symptoms produced depend on the type of microbe.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|work=US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/food/index.htm |title=Food-Related Diseases|date=2018-03-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious dose===
The [[infectious dose]] is the amount of agent that must be consumed to give rise to symptoms of foodborne illness, and varies according to the agent and the consumer's age and overall health. Pathogens vary in minimum infectious dose; for example, ''[[Shigella sonnei]]'' has a low estimated minimum dose of &lt; 500 [[colony-forming unit]]s (CFU) while ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' has a relatively high estimate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greig|first=Judy D|date=|title=Infective Doses and Pathogen Carriage|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265305465|journal=|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Salmonella]]'' a relatively large inoculum of 1 million to 1 billion organisms is necessary to produce symptoms in healthy human volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Michael D (January 2014) [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic515.htm Salmonella Infection in Emergency Medicine]. emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Salmonellae'' are very sensitive to acid. An unusually high stomach [[pH]] level (low acidity) greatly reduces the number of bacteria required to cause symptoms by a factor of between 10 and 100.

==Epidemiology==
Asymptomatic [[subclinical infection]] may help spread these diseases, particularly ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]], [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]], [[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]],'' and [[Yersinia pestis|''Yersinia'']].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, as of 1984 it was estimated that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers of ''Salmonella''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Infants===
{{Main | Infant food safety}}
Globally, infants are a population that are especially vulnerable to foodborne disease. The World Health Organization has issued recommendations for the preparation, use and storage of prepared formulas.

===United States===
In the United States, using FoodNet data from 2000–2007, the CDCP estimated there were 47.8 million foodborne illnesses per year (16,000 cases for 100,000 inhabitants)&lt;ref name=CDC11Unspec&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=16–22 | year=2011 |vauthors=Scallan E, Griffin PM, Angulo FJ, Tauxe RV, Hoekstra RM | title=Foodborne illness acquired in the United States—unspecified agents | doi = 10.3201/eid1701.P21101 | pmid=21192849 | pmc=3204615}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 9.4 million of these caused by 31 known identified pathogens.&lt;ref name=CDC11Spec /&gt;

===Australia===

A study by the Australian National University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Martyn|title=Foodborne illness in Australia: Annual incidence circa 2010 pp7-9|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-foodborne-illness-aust|website=Australia Department of Health|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=13 September 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in November 2014, found in 2010 that there were an estimated 4.1 million cases of foodborne gastroenteritis acquired in Australia on average each year, along with 5,140 cases of non-gastrointestinal illness. The study was funded by the Australian Department of Health, Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the NSW Food Authority.

The main causes were Norovirus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., although the causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates to an average of approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.

A main aim of this study was to compare if foodborne illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.

This study replaces a previous estimate of 5.4 million cases of food-borne illness in Australia every year, causing:&lt;ref&gt;

===Outbreaks===
{{Main article|Deadliest foodborne illness incidents}}
The vast majority of reported cases of foodborne illness occur as individual or sporadic cases. The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data).   An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.

Often, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to [[multiplication|multiply]] which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.

Outbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. However, more and more, outbreaks are identified by [[public health]] staff from unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1–2% of outbreaks are detected.

==Society and culture==

===United Kingdom===

In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a large-scale (&gt;400 cases) outbreak of [[typhoid]] occurred, caused by contaminated [[corned beef]] which had been imported from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;
Smith, David F.; Diack, H. Lesley and Pennington, T. Hugh (2005) ''Food Poisoning, Policy and Politics : Corned Beef and Typhoid in Britain in the 1960s''. Boydell Press. {{ISBN|1-84383-138-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the [[Río de la Plata|Plate estuary]] was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.

Serious outbreaks of foodborne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK [[food safety]] law. These included the death of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/social/stanley-royd.htm|title=Food poison deaths probe may reveal NHS flaws|date=February 24, 1985|author=Brian Deer|work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s. The death of 21 people in the [[1996 Wishaw outbreak]] of ''E. coli'' O157&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/154107.stm|title=BBC News - Health - Sheriff criticises E. coli butcher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869700/pdf/11467789.pdf|title=Epidemiological investigation of the Central Scotland outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection, November to December 1996|year=2001|volume=126|issue=3|pages= 335–341|journal=Epidemiol.

In May 2015, for the second year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. The focus was on the handling of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the ''campylobacter'' bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. She points to the examples set by [[Scandinavia]]n societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/food-poisoning-an-on-going-saga|title=Food Poisoning: An On-going Saga|last=Hardy|first=Anne|date=13 January 2016|website=History and Policy|publisher=History and Policy|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2001, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] petitioned the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to require meat packers to remove [[spinal cord]]s before processing cattle carcasses for human consumption, a measure designed to lessen the risk of infection by variant [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]. The petition was supported by the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the [[Government Accountability Project]], the [[National Consumers League]], and Safe Tables Our Priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2004/01/12/04-626/meat-produced-by-advanced-meatbone-separation-machinery-and-meat-recovery-amr-systems#footnote-10 |accessdate=3 July 2016 |title=Meat Produced by Advanced Meat/Bone Separation Machinery and Meat Recovery (AMR) Systems |website=Federal Register |publisher=U.S. National Archive and Records Administration|date=2004-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]], the National Renderers Association, the [[National Meat Association]], the Pork Producers Council, sheep raisers, milk producers, the Turkey Federation, and eight other organizations from the animal-derived food industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/madcow/stauber011503.php |accessdate=3 July 2016 |title=Livestock Industry Opposed to Stricter Laws on Mad Cow Prevention |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the US Department of Health and Human Services targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov|title=Healthy People 2010 Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding incidence of foodborne infections were reached in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preliminary FoodNet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food—10 states, 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb.

A report issued in June 2018 by NBC's Minneapolis station using research by both the CDC and the Minnesota Department of Health concluded that foodborne illness is on the rise in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kare11.com/article/news/why-are-we-seeing-so-many-food-recalls/89-564858966|title=Why are we seeing so many food recalls?|publisher=KARE 11|first1=Gordon|last1=Severson|date=June 15, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC has reported approximately four thousand cases of food poisoning annually in the last few years. Experts cite increased handling of food by humans as a major contributor, leading to outbreaks of parasites such as ''E. coli'' and cyclospora which can only come from human fecal matter.

===Organizations===

The [[World Health Organization]] Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, most of whom are children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.

===International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)===

The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is a joint program of the WHO and FAO. INFOSAN has been connecting national authorities from around the globe since 2004, with the goal of preventing the international spread of contaminated food and foodborne disease and strengthening food safety systems globally. This is done by:

# Promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events;
# Sharing information on important food safety issues of global interest;
# Promoting partnership and collaboration between countries; and
# Helping countries strengthen their capacity to manage food safety risks.

Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is restricted to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points in each of the respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the [[farm-to-table]] continuum.

===Prioritisation of food-borne pathogens===

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and The World Health Organization published have made a global ranking of food-borne parasites using a multicriteria ranking tool concluding that ''Taenia solium'' was the most relevant, followed by ''Echinococcus granulosus'', ''Echinococcus multilocularis'', and ''Toxoplasma gondii''&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=FAO, WHO |title=Multicriteria-based ranking for risk management of food-borne parasites. Microbiological Risk Assessment Series No. 23 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=324 p |date=2014 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=  |url=http://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/ee07c6ae-b86c-4d5f-915c-94c93ded7d9e/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The same method was used regionally to rank the most important food-borne parasites in Europe ranking ''Echinococcus multilocularis'' of highest relevance, followed by ''Toxoplasma gondii'' and ''Trichinella spiralis''&lt;ref name=eur&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouwknegt M, Devleesschauwer B, Graham H, Robertson LJ,  WB van der Giessen J, ((the Euro-FBP workshop participants)) |title=Prioritisation of food-borne parasites in Europe, 2016 |journal=Euro Surveill |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages= | year=2018 | pmid=29510783 |pmc= 5840924|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.9.17-00161 | url=https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.9.17-00161#r1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Regulatory steps===

Food may be contaminated during all stages of food production and retailing. In order to prevent viral contamination, regulatory authorities in Europe have enacted several measures:

* European Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of November 15, 2005
* [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN): Standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in food products (shellfish, fruits and vegetables, surfaces and bottled water)
* CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH): Guideline for the application of general principles of food hygiene for the control of viruses in food&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/standard_setting_bodies/codex/organisations/eupositions/ccfh/index_en.htm "Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH)"], European Commission, Retrieved April 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

'''Health information management''' ('''HIM''') is [[information management]] applied to [[health]] and [[health care]]. It is the practice of acquiring, analyzing and protecting digital and traditional medical information vital to providing [[health care quality|quality patient care]]. With the widespread computerization of health records, traditional (paper-based) records are being replaced with [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs). The tools of [[health informatics]] and [[health information technology]] are continually improving to bring greater [[efficiency]] to information management in the [[health care system|health care sector]]. Both [[hospital information system]]s and [[HRHIS|Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS)]] are common implementations of HIM.

'''Health information management professionals''' plan [[information system]]s, develop [[health policy]], and identify current and future information needs. In addition, they may apply the science of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] to the collection, storage, analysis, use, and transmission of information to meet legal, professional, ethical and administrative records-keeping requirements of [[health care]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2010). ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva: WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;  They work with clinical, epidemiological, demographic, financial, reference, and coded healthcare data. [[Registered Health Information Administrator|Health information administrators]] have been described to "play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare in the [[United States]] through their focus on the collection, maintenance and use of quality data to support the information-intensive and information-reliant healthcare system".&lt;ref&gt;(LaTour, Kathleen M., &amp; Maki, Shirley Eichenwald. (2010). Health information management concepts, principles, and practice. Chicago, Illinois: American Health Information Management Association.)(LaTour, &amp; Maki, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] stated that the proper collection, management and use of information within healthcare systems "will determine the system's effectiveness in detecting health problems, defining priorities, identifying innovative solutions and allocating resources to improve health outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield S. (2005). "Structuring information and incentives to improve health". ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', 83(8):562.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of HIM standards in the United States==

===HIM standards began with establishment of AHIMA===
Health information management's standards history is dated back to the introduction of the [[American Health Information Management Association]], founded in 1928 "when the [[American College of Surgeons]] established the Association of Record Librarians of North America (ARLNA) to 'elevate the standards of clinical records in hospitals and other medical institutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2010). "[http://www.ahima.org/about/history.asp AHIMA History]". AHIMA. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, AHIMA was known as American Association of Medical Record Librarians (AAMRL) and its members were known as medical record experts or [[librarian]]s who studied medical record science. The goal was to raise the standards of records keeping in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The individuals involved in this profession were promoters for the successful management of clinical records to guarantee accuracy and precision. Over time, the organization's name changed to reflect the evolving field of health information management practices, eventually becoming the American Health Information Management Association. The association's current name is meant to cover the wide variety of areas which health professionals work in today.

AHIMA members affect the quality of patient information and patient care at every touch point in the healthcare delivery cycle. They often serve in bridge roles, connecting clinical, operational, and administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahima.org/popups/partner.asp Partner in the Delivery of Quality Healthcare]. (n.d.). Retrieved November 28, 2009, from American Health Information Management Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIMSS establishment in 1961 increased industry knowledge===
The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS) was organized in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society (HMSS), an independent, [[Unincorporated entity|unincorporated]], [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]], voluntary association of individuals. It was preceded by increasing amounts of [[Management engineering (healthcare)|management engineering]] activity in healthcare during the 1950s, when teachings of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] began to attract the attention of health leaders.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS (2008). "[http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_HISTORY.pdf AHIMA History]". HIMSS Legacy Workgroup. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIMSS grew to include chapters, membership categories, publications, conventions, and continues to grow in different parts of the world via its [[Europe]], [[Asia Pacific]], and [[Middle East]]ern branches.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS. [http://www.himss.org HIMSS.org]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accredited HIM educational program development===
The [[Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education]] (CAHIIM) defines standards which [[higher education]] health information management and technology programs must meet to qualify for [[accreditation]]. Students who graduate from an accredited [[Associate's degree|associate's]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Academic certificate|certificate]] program are qualified to sit for their respective exams for certification as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) – via graduation from an accredited associate or certification program or [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA), which requires education through an accredited bachelor or certification program. Competency requirements are maintained by CAHIIM in their associate degree Entry-Level Competencies and Baccalaureate Degree Entry-Level Competencies definitions.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. 6/3/2004 [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/internalproject_bok/bok1_036792.pdf HIM Associate Degree Entry-Level Competencies]. AHIMA Education Strategy Committee. Accessed 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. 4/20/2004 [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/internalproject_bok/bok1_036793.pdf HIM Baccalaureate Degree Entry-Level Competencies].

==Modern development==

===Electronic health records===
{{Main|Electronic health record}}
&lt;!--Full information on electronic health records can be found at its own article.--&gt;
The electronic health record has been continually expressed as an evolvement of health record-keeping. Because it is electronic, this means of record keeping has been both supported and debated in the health professional community and within the public realm.

In the United States, 89% of those who responded to a recent [[Wall Street Journal]] poll described themselves as "Very/Somewhat Confident" in their health care provider who used electronic health records compared to 71% of respondents who responded positively about their providers who didn't or don't use electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal. [https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119565244262500549.html?mod=blog "Benefits of Electronic Health Records Seen as Outweighing Privacy Risks"]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, more than fifty-percent of [[Chief Information Officer]]s polled listed that they wanted ambulatory electronic health records in order to have the health information record available to move across each stage of health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himss.org/content/files/IntegrationConnectivitySurvey.pdf Healthcare Integration and Connectivity: Results of a Survey by the Enterprise Information Systems Steering Committee] page 4. HIMSS. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health information managers are charged with the protection of patient privacy and are responsible for training their employees in the proper handling and usage of the confidential information entrusted to them. With the rise of technology's importance in healthcare, health information managers must remain competent with the use of information databases that generate crucial reports for administrators and physicians.

=== Educational programs ===
{{main|List of CAHIIM-accredited HIM Programs in the United States}}

The requisites and accreditation processes for health information management education and professional activity vary across jurisdictions.

In the United States, the CAHIIM requires continued accreditation for accredited programs in health information management. The current standard is that accreditation may be maintained with periodic site visits, submission of an annual report, informing CAHIIM of adverse changes within the program and paying CAHIIM administrative fees.&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044387.pdf 2005 Interpretation of Standards: Associate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044386.pdf Interpretation of Standards: Baccalaureate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  HIM students may opt to participate in a full-time [[Bridge program (higher education)|bridge program]] called the Joint Bachelor of Science/Masters Program. With this program, students can achieve both the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management and the Master of Health Services Administration Program (BSHIM/MHSA). The full-time bridge program allows students to achieve both degrees in five years. Students pursuing the BSHIM/MHSA will be prepared to assume management and executive positions in health-related organizations such as: hospitals, managed care organizations, health information system developers and vendors, and [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] companies, and bring their knowledge in HIM to these positions.

In Canada, graduates of Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) programs are eligible to write a national certification examination to pursue a profession in HIM.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Occupational Profiles, 2011. ''Health Information Management Professional'' http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71002536&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online program availability====
There are many programs that are also available online. Online students collaborate with in-class students using internet technology. With online learning, students are allowed to go through the programs at their own pace. Online students are included in class through group lectures that are recorded and put online, discussion boards and are members of group projects with in-class students. Some online students are even allowed to attend some classes on campus and take some classes online.

The CAHIIM lists accredited online programs on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp CAHIIM.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721005333/http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp |date=2012-07-21 }}. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further education for health information professionals====
Education is an important aspect in being successful in the world of health information management. Aside from initial credentials, health information professionals may wish to pursue a Masters of Health Information Management, [[Masters of Business Administration]], [[Masters of Health Administration]], or other Masters programs in health data management, information technology and systems, and organization and management. Gaining further education advances the health professional's career and qualifies the individual for upper-management positions.

==Canada (CHIMA)==
In Canada, current HIM employees are mostly called the "Health Information Management Professionals", with the designation of "Certified Health Information Manager" (CHIM). The accrediting association here is the Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.echima.ca/home Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The following list below consists of Canadian post-secondary schools that have given full accreditation for their HIM programs from CHIMA:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.echima.ca/cchim/him-program Accredited HIM Schools in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
Healthcare quality and safety require that the right information be available at the right time to support patient care and health system management decisions. Gaining consensus on essential data content and documentation standards is a necessary prerequisite for high-quality data in the interconnected healthcare system of the future. Continuous quality management of data standards and content is key to ensuring that information is usable and actionable.&lt;ref&gt;Mervat Abdelhak et al.: “Health Information: Management of a Strategic Resource”, Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
*The '''patient health record''' is the primary legal record documenting the health care services provided to a person in any aspect of the health care system. The term includes routine clinical or office records, records of care in any health related setting, preventive care, lifestyle evaluation, research protocols and various clinical databases. This repository of information about a single patient is generated by health care professionals as a direct result of interaction with a patient or with individuals who have personal knowledge of the patient.
*The '''primary patient record''' is the record that is used by health care professionals while providing patient care services to review patient data or document their own observations, actions, or instructions.
*The '''secondary patient record''' is a record that is derived from the primary record and contains selected data elements to aid non clinical persons in supporting, evaluating and advancing patient care.  Patient care support refers to administration, regulation, and payment functions.

===Practices===

====Methods to ensure Data Quality====
The accuracy of data depends on the manual or computer information system design for collecting, recording, storing, processing, accessing and displaying data as well as the ability and follow- through of the people involved in each phase of these activities. Everyone involved with documenting or using health information is responsible for its quality. According to AHIMA’s Data Quality Management Model, there are four key processes for data:

#'''Application''': the purpose for which the data are collected.
#'''Collection''': the processes by which data elements are accumulated.
#'''Warehousing''': the processes and systems used to store and maintain data and data journals.
#'''Analysis''': the process of translating data into information utilized for an application.

Each aspect is analyzed with 10 different data characteristics:

#'''Accuracy''': Data are the correct values and are valid.
#'''Accessibility''': Data items should be easily obtainable and legal to collect.
#'''Comprehensiveness''': All required data items are included. Ensure that the entire scope of the data is collected and document intentional limitations.
#'''Consistency''': The value of the data should be reliable and the same across applications.
#'''Currency''': The data should be up to date. A datum value is up to date if it is current for a specific point in time. It is outdate if it was current at some preceding time yet incorrect at a later time.
#'''Definition''': Clear definitions should be provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element should have clear meaning and acceptable values.
#'''Granularity''': The attributes and values of data should be defined at the correct level of detail.
#'''Precision''': Data values should be just large enough to support the application or process.
#'''Relevancy''': The data are meaningful to the performance of the process or application for which they are collected.
#'''Timeliness''': Timeliness is determined by how the data are being used and their context.

==Health information professionals==
HIM is a very broad and successful field for [[health care provider|health care professionals]]. There are several career opportunities in Health Information Management and many different traditional and non-traditional settings for an HIM professional to work within.

*Traditional settings include: Managing an HIM medical records department, [[cancer registry]], [[Medical classification|coding]], trauma registry, [[Medical transcription|transcription]], [[Quality management|quality improvement]], [[Release of information department|release of information]], patient admissions, compliance auditor, physician accreditation, utilization review, physician offices and [[risk management]].
*Non-traditional settings include: consulting firms, government agencies, law firms, insurance companies, correctional facilities, extended care facilities, pharmaceutical research, information technology and [[medical software]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health information managers===
Professional health information managers manage and construct health information programs to guarantee they accommodate medical, legal, and ethical standards. They play a crucial role in the maintenance, collection, and analyzing of data that is received by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare players. In return these healthcare data contributors rely on the information to deliver quality healthcare. Managers must work with a group of information technicians to guarantee that the patient's medical records are accurate and are available when needed.

In the United States, health information managers are typically certified as a [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA) after achieving a bachelor's degree in health informatics or health information management from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) and after passing their respective certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. [http://www.ahima.org/certification/rhia/requirements.aspx Eligibility Requirements: Registered Health Information Administrator]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Certified Health Informatics Systems Professional (CHISP) certification offered by American Society of Health Informatics Managers (ASHIM)&lt;ref&gt;CHISP Healthcare IT certification. [http://ashim.org/certification/ CHISP Certification Requirement ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307012558/http://ashim.org/certification/ |date=2010-03-07 }}. Retrieved 3/2/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is to credit a working level IT or clinical professional who is able to support physician adoption of Health IT.  A CHISP professional needs to process knowledge of the health care environment, Health IT, IT, and soft skills including communication skills.

RHIAs usually assume a managerial position that interacts with all levels of an organization that use patient data in decision making and everyday operations.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago State University [http://www.csu.edu/healthsciences/healthinformationadministration/documents/profession.pdf Profession]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They may work in a broad range of settings that span the continuum of healthcare including office based physician practices, nursing homes, home health agencies, mental health facilities, and public health agencies.

Health information managers may specialize in registry management, data management, and data quality among other areas.

===Medical records and Health information technicians===
{{See also|Clinical coder}}
Medical records (MR) and Health information technicians (HIT) are described as having the following duties according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook:&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition. [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;assemble patients' health information including medical history, symptoms, examination results, diagnostic tests, treatment methods, and all other healthcare provider services. Technicians organize and manage health information data by ensuring its quality, accuracy, accessibility, and security. They regularly communicate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to clarify diagnoses or to obtain additional information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The International Labour Organization's [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]] further notes: "Occupations included in this category require knowledge of medical terminology, legal aspects of health information, health data standards, and computer- or paper-based data management as obtained through formal education and/or prolonged on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 revision: Unit Group 3252: Medical records and health information technicians. http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MRHITs usually work in hospitals. However they also work in a variety of other healthcare settings, including office based physician practices, [[nursing home]]s, [[home care|home health agencies]], [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facilities]], and public health agencies. Technicians who specialize in coding are called [[medical coder]]s or coding specialists.

In the United States, health information technicians are certified as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) after completing an associate degree in [[health information technology]] from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) before they may take their certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2008). "Eligibility Requirements". AHIMA. http://www.ahima.org/certification/rhia/requirements.aspx. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthcare in Egypt''' consists of both a public and private sector. Public health coverage is offered through Ministry of Health, which operates a series of medical facilities providing free health services. There are two main private insurers. The Health Insurance Organization covers employed persons, students, and widows through premiums deducted from employee salaries and employer payrolls. It operates its own network of medical facilities and at times contracts with private healthcare providers. The Curative Care Organization operates in specific govern orates, and contracts with other entities for provision of care. There are also private insurance options, and a network of private healthcare providers and medical facilities. Many [[mosque]]s also operate their own clinics, especially in the large cities. Many churches offer subsidized or free clinics.

Medical care offered by the public health insurance system is generally of poor quality. Government hospitals are known to be rife with negligence and generally provide minimal care. Only about 6% of Egyptians covered by the Health Insurance Organization actually utilize its services due to dissatisfaction with the level of services it funds. In 2008/2009, 72% of health expenditure in Egypt was paid out of pocket by people seeking treatment.

Egypt is currently working on an overhaul of its public healthcare system to improve its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/egypt-health-care-new-insurance-law.html|title=Egypt debates health care reform|date=24 November 2014|website=Al-monitor.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghdnews.com/index.php/global-health-partnerships-and-solutions/profiles/43-egypts-health-care-system |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104126/http://www.ghdnews.com/index.php/global-health-partnerships-and-solutions/profiles/43-egypts-health-care-system |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmaphorum.com/articles/egypt-moving-toward-integrated-healthcare-system|title=Egypt moving toward integrated healthcare system|website=Pharmaphorum.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Egypt/Egypt-Guide/Health/Introduction|title=Introduction|website=Justlanded.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft law was approved in October 2017 which would increase citizens’ contribution from the present 4% of wages to 5% , with 4% to be paid by employers and 1% by employees. The [[Egyptian Medical Syndicate]] is concerned that this may lead to privatisation of public hospitals, especially those that might not meet the quality standards set by the new law. They say only 20% of the 660 government hospitals are committed to safety and infection control standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's new health care law has medical community worried|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/egypt-new-health-care-law-concerns-public-hospitals-private.html|accessdate=19 February 2018|publisher=Al Monitor|date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors' pay in Egypt is low. Monthly salaries range from 1,218 Egyptian pounds ($69) to 6,365 Egyptian pounds ($361) per month. Of the [[Egyptian Medical Syndicate]]'s members only about a third are working in the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian doctors moonlight as chefs|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/09/egypts-doctor-by-day-chefs-by-night.html|accessdate=19 February 2018|publisher=AL Monitor|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is based on the differential in atmospheric pressure, directly correlated with the observer's frequency of and level of experience in high-altitude metabolism. As the external pressure decreases, the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher, and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater. Consistent with [[Boyle's law]], controlling for dietary variance, the amount of gas produced is constant in mass, but the volume increases as the external pressure decreases.

The feeling of fullness or need to expel brought on by this differential in atmospheric pressure has been verified by studies involving military pilots subjected to pressure changes simulating flight.&lt;ref name="pmid5765206"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AJ, Allen TH, Bancroft RW |title=Abdominal gas volume at altitude and at ground level |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=177–81 |date=February 1969 |pmid=5765206 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5765206 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This legend is the subject of the [[noh]] drama ''Sanjo Kokaji''.]]
{{nihongo|'''Inari Ōkami'''|稲荷大神|| also '''Oinari'''}} is the [[Japan]]ese ''[[kami]]'' of [[Red fox|foxes]], of [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]], [[rice]], [[tea]] and [[sake]], of [[agriculture]] and [[industry]], of general prosperity and worldly success, and one of the principal kami of [[Shinto]]. In earlier Japan, Inari was also the patron of [[swordsmith]]s and [[merchant]]s.  Represented as [[male]], [[female]], or [[Androgyny|androgynous]], Inari is sometimes seen as a collective of three or five individual ''kami''. Inari appears to have been worshipped since the founding of a shrine at Inari Mountain in 711 AD, although some scholars believe that worship started in the late 5th century.

By the 16th century Inari had become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors, and worship of Inari spread across Japan in the [[Edo period]]. Inari is a popular figure in both [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs in Japan.  More than one-third (32,000) of the Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to Inari.  Modern corporations, such as cosmetic company [[Shiseido]], continue to revere Inari as a patron kami, with shrines atop their corporate headquarters.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reader | first = Ian | title = Simple Guides: Shinto | publisher = Kuperard | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-85733-433-7 | pages=20, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari's foxes, or ''[[kitsune]]'', are pure white and act as their messengers.

==Depiction==
[[File:A man confronted with an apparition of the Fox goddess.jpg|thumb|left|Inari appears to a warrior.  This portrayal of Inari shows the influence of [[Dakiniten]] concepts from [[Buddhism]].]]
Inari has been depicted both as male and as female.  The most popular representations of Inari, according to scholar Karen Ann Smyers, are a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name="Smyers8"&gt;Smyers, Karen Ann. The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1999. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  No one view is correct; the preferred gender of depiction varies according to regional traditions and individual beliefs.&lt;ref name="Smyers8"/&gt;  Because of their close association with ''kitsune'', Inari is often believed to be a fox; though this belief is widespread, both Shinto and Buddhist priests discourage it.&lt;ref name="Smyers8"/&gt;  Inari also appears in the form of a snake or dragon, and one [[Folklore|folktale]] has Inari appear to a wicked man in the shape of a monstrous [[spider]] as a way of teaching him a lesson.

Inari is sometimes identified with other mythological figures.  Some scholars suggest that Inari is the figure known in classical [[Japanese mythology]] as [[Ukanomitama]] or the ''[[Kojiki]]'s'' [[Uke Mochi|Ōgetsu-Hime]]; others suggest Inari is the same figure as [[Toyouke-Ōmikami|Toyouke]].  Some take Inari to be identical to any grain ''kami''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 7, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael.  ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''.  Santa Barbara, California:  ABC-Clio, 2003. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari's female aspect is often identified or conflated with [[Dakiniten]], a [[Buddhist]] [[deity]] who is a Japanese transformation of the [[India]]n ''[[dakini]]'',&lt;ref name="Smyers8283"&gt;Smyers 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[Benzaiten]] of the [[Seven Lucky Gods]].&lt;ref name="Oinari"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/oinari.shtml |title=Oinari |accessdate=2007-02-17 |work=A to Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhist &amp; Shinto Deities |last=Schumacher |first=Mark |date=September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dakiniten is portrayed as a female or androgynous bodhisattva riding a flying white fox.&lt;ref name="Smyers8283"/&gt;  Inari's association with Buddhism may have begun in the 8th century, when [[Shingon]] Buddhist monk and founder, [[Kūkai]], took over administration of the temple of [[Tō-ji|Tōji]], and chose Inari as a protector of the temple.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;  Thus, Inari is still closely associated with Shingon Buddhism to this day.

Inari is often venerated as a collective of three deities (''Inari sanza''); since the [[Kamakura period]], this number has sometimes increased to five ''kami'' (''Inari goza'').  However, the identification of these ''kami'' has varied over time.  According to records of [[Fushimi Inari]], the oldest and perhaps most prominent Inari shrine, these ''kami'' have included [[Izanagi]], [[Izanami]], [[Ninigi]], and [[Wakumusubi]], in addition to the food deities previously mentioned. The five ''kami'' today identified with Inari at Fushimi Inari are Ukanomitama, [[Sarutahiko]], Omiyanome, Tanaka, and Shi.  However, at [[Takekoma Inari]], the second-oldest Inari shrine in Japan, the three enshrined deities are Ukanomitama, Ukemochi, and Wakumusubi.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 151–155&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Nijūni shaki]], the three ''kami'' are Ōmiyame no mikoto (water,) Ukanomitama no mikoto (grain,) and Sarutahiko no mikami (land.)

The fox and the wish-fulfilling jewel are prominent symbols of Inari.  Other common elements in depictions of Inari, and sometimes of their ''kitsune'', include a sickle, a sheaf or sack of rice, and a sword. Another belonging was their whip—although they were hardly known to use it, it was a powerful weapon that was used to burn people's crops of rice.

==History==
[[File:Vulpes vulpes laying in snow.jpg|thumb|right|The Hokkaido red fox]]
[[File:Kobayashi Izanami and Izanagi.jpg|thumb|left|180px|{{nihongo|''Searching the Seas with the [[Amenonuhoko|Tenkei]]''|天瓊を以て滄海を探るの図|Tenkei o motte sōkai o saguru no zu}}. Painting by Kobayashi Eitaku, 1880–90 (MFA, Boston). Izanagi to the right, Izanami to the left.]]

The origin of Inari worship is not entirely clear. The first recorded use of the present-day ''[[kanji]]'' (''characters'') of Inari's name, which mean "carrying rice", (literally "rice load") was in the ''[[Ruijū Kokushi]]'' in 892 AD. Other sets of ''kanji'' with the same phonetic readings, most of which contained a reference to rice, were in use earlier, and most scholars agree that the name ''Inari'' is derived from {{nihongo|''ine-nari'' (''growing rice'')|稲成り}}.&lt;ref name="Smyers15"&gt;Smyers 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The worship of Inari is known to have existed as of 711 AD, the official founding date of the shrine at Inari Mountain in [[Fushimi, Kyoto]].  Scholars such as Kazuo Higo believe worship was conducted for centuries before that date; they suggest that the [[Hata tribe|Hata clan]] began the formal worship of Inari as an agriculture ''kami'' in the late fifth century.&lt;ref name="Higo"&gt;Higo, Kazuo.  "Inari Shinkō no Hajime".  ''Inari Shinkō'' (ed. Hiroji Naoe).  Tokyo: Yūzankaku Shuppan, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Inari does not appear in classical [[Japanese mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 16&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Heian period]], Inari worship began to spread.  In 823 AD, after [[Emperor Saga]] presented the [[Tō-ji]] temple to [[Kūkai]], the founder of the [[Shingon]] Buddhist sect, the latter designated Inari as its resident protector ''kami''.&lt;ref name="Higo"/&gt;  In 827, the court granted Inari the lower fifth rank, which further increased the deity's popularity in the capital.  Inari's rank was subsequently increased, and by 942, [[Emperor Suzaku]] granted Inari the top rank in thanks for overcoming rebellions.  At this time, the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha]] shrine was among the twenty-two shrines chosen by the court to receive imperial patronage, a high honor.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;  The second Inari shrine, Takekoma Inari, was established in the late ninth century.

Inari's popularity continued to grow.  The Fushimi shrine, already a popular pilgrimage site, gained wide renown when it became an imperial pilgrimage site in 1072.  By 1338, the shrine's festival was said to rival the [[Gion Matsuri|Gion Festival]] in splendor.&lt;ref name="Smyers18"&gt;Smyers 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1468, during the [[Ōnin War]], the entire Fushimi shrine complex was burned.  Rebuilding took about thirty years; the new building was consecrated in 1499.  While the old complex had enshrined three ''kami'' in separate buildings, the new one enshrined five ''kami'' in a single building.  The new shrine also included a Buddhist temple building for the first time, and the hereditary priesthood was expanded to include the [[Kada clan]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inuyama inari 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of a ''[[kitsune]]'' adorned with a red votive bib in a shrine at [[Inuyama]] Castle.  Many castles in Japan contain Inari shrines.]]
During the [[Edo period]], Inari worship spread across Japan; it became especially prominent in [[Edo]].&lt;ref name="Smyers20"&gt;Smyers 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Smyers attributes this spread to the movement of ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords).  Inari had by the sixteenth century become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors—for this reason, many castle compounds in Japan contain Inari shrines—and the ''daimyōs'' took their belief in their protector ''kami'' with them when they relocated to a new domain.&lt;ref name="Smyers20"/&gt;  Inari's divine role continued to expand; on the coast, they became a protector of fishermen; in Edo, they were invoked to prevent fires.  They became the patron of actors and of prostitutes, since their shrines were often found near the pleasure quarters where these individuals lived.  They began to be worshipped as the ''Desire-Fulfilling Inari'', a deity of luck and prosperity; a common saying in [[Osaka]] was ''Byō Kōbō, yoku Inari'' (''For sickness [pray to] [[Kōbō Daishi|Kōbō]], for desires [pray to] Inari'').&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ono, Yasuhiro, ed.  ''Nihon Shūkyō Jiten''.  Tokyo: Kobundo, 1985. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Inari also began to be petitioned for good health; they are credited with curing such diverse afflictions as coughs, toothaches, broken bones, and syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 94, 137–138, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Women prayed to Inari to grant them children.

After a government decree mandated the separation of Buddhist and Shinto beliefs, many Inari shrines underwent changes.  At Fushimi Inari, for instance, structures that were obviously Buddhist were torn down.  Among the populace, however, the blended form of worship continued.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Buddhist temples, such as [[Toyokawa Inari]], maintained Inari worship by arguing that they had always been devoted to a Buddhist deity (often Dakiniten), which the common folk had mistaken as Inari.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tokugawa period]], when money replaced rice as the measure of wealth in Japan, Inari's role as a ''kami'' of worldly prosperity was expanded to include all aspects of finance, business, and industry.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, followers of Inari at the [[Ginza]] mint struck coins meant for offerings to Inari, which featured pictures of two foxes and a jewel or the characters for ''long life'' and ''good luck''.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrines and offerings==
{{main|Inari shrine}}
Inari is a popular deity with shrines and temples located throughout most of [[Japan]].  According to a 1985 survey by the National Association of Shinto Shrines, 32,000 shrines—more than one-third of Shinto shrines in Japan—are dedicated to Inari.&lt;ref&gt;Okada, Shōji.  "Reii-jin to Sūkei-kō".  ''Nihon Shūkyō Jiten'' (1985). 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;  This number includes only Shinto shrines with full-time resident priests; if small roadside or field shrines, shrines kept in a home or corporate office, smaller shrines without full-time resident priests, and Buddhist temples were included, the number would increase by at least an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Gorai, Shigeru. ''Inari Shinkō no Kenkyū.'' Okayama: Sanyō Shimbunsha, 1985. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrance to an Inari shrine is usually marked by one or more [[vermilion]] [[torii]] and some statues of ''kitsune'', which are often adorned with red ''yodarekake'' (''votive bibs'') by worshippers out of respect.  This red color has come to be identified with Inari, because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their torii.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 60, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  The main shrine is the [[Fushimi Inari]] Shrine in [[Fushimi, Kyoto|Fushimi]], [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]], Japan, where the paths up the shrine hill are marked in this fashion.  The ''kitsune'' statues are at times taken for a form of Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"&gt;Smyers 93&lt;/ref&gt;  These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw—most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common.  Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Smyers93"/&gt;  The statues are rarely realistic; they are typically stylized, portraying a seated animal with its tail in the air looking forward.  Despite these common characteristics, the statues are highly individual in nature; no two are quite the same.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 93, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Lafcadio. ''Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan''. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8130 Project Gutenberg e-text edition], 2005. 152–153. Retrieved on February 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offerings of [[rice]], [[sake]], and other food are given at the shrine to appease and please these ''kitsune'' messengers, who are then expected to plead with Inari on the worshipper's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 154&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sushi#Inarizushi|Inari-zushi]], a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering.  Fried tofu is believed to be a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Priests do not normally offer these foods to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple.  At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
Inari's traditional festival day was the first horse day (the sixth day) of the second month (''nigatsu no hatsuuma'') of the [[lunisolar calendar]].&lt;ref name="Smyers18"/&gt;

In some parts of [[Kyūshū]], a festival or praying period begins five days before the full moon in November; occasionally it is extended to a full week.  This is accompanied by bringing offerings of rice products to a shrine to Inari each day and receiving ''[[o-mamori]]'' (''[[amulet|protection charms]]''). &lt;!-- Commented out as citation can't be found: The festival is particularly popular{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} in the countryside near [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].--&gt;

An '''intelligent medical search engine''' is a [[vertical search]] engine that uses [[expert system]] technology to provide personalized medical information.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, SIGIR 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Searching for medical information on the Web is a challenging task for ordinary Internet users. Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with [[medical terminology]], and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, ICPR 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An intelligent medical [[search engine]] is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive [[questionnaire]]-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting [[symptom]]s and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic [[decision tree]]s) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, SIGIR 2008; Luo, AAAI 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections). The contents of those lists are ranked using medical knowledge and specially designed medical [[information retrieval]] techniques.

'''MUMPS''' (''Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System''), or '''M''', is a general-purpose computer [[programming language]] originally designed in 1966 for the healthcare industry. Its differentiating feature is its "built-in" database, enabling high-level access to disk storage using simple symbolic program [[variable (computer science)|variables]] and subscripted [[Array data structure|arrays]]; similar to the variables used by most languages to access main memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/mumps-the-internet-scale-database-presentation|title=Mumps the Internet scale database|first=|last=george.james|date=22 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continues to be used today by many large hospitals and banks to provide high-throughput transaction data processing.

== History ==
{{For |context |Timeline of programming languages}}

===Genesis===
MUMPS was developed by [[Neil Pappalardo]], Robert Greenes, and Curt Marble in Dr. Octo Barnett's animal lab at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) in [[Boston]] during 1966 and 1967.

The original MUMPS system was, like [[Unix]] a few years later, built on a spare [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-7]]. Octo Barnett and Neil Pappalardo were also involved with MGH's planning for a Hospital Information System, obtained a [[backward compatible]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]], and began using MUMPS in the admissions cycle and laboratory test reporting. MUMPS was then an [[interpreted language]], yet even then, incorporated a [[hierarchical database]] file system to standardize interaction with the data.

Some aspects of MUMPS can be traced from [[Rand Corporation]]'s [[JOSS]] through [[BBN Technologies|BBN]]'s [[TELCOMP]] and [[STRINGCOMP]]. The MUMPS team deliberately chose to include portability between machines as a design goal. Another feature, not widely supported for machines of the era, in [[operating system]]s or in [[computer hardware]], was [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], which was also built into the language itself.{{Citation needed|reason=What sort of multitasking are we talking about? Timesharing was already spreading rapidly by the time MUMPS was being created|date=April 2014}}

The portability was soon useful, as MUMPS was shortly adapted to a DEC [[PDP-15]], where it lived for some time. MUMPS was developed with the support of a government research grant, and so MUMPS was released to the public domain (no longer a requirement for grants), and was soon ported to a number of other systems including the popular DEC [[PDP-8]], the [[Data General Nova]] and the DEC [[PDP-11]] and the [[Artronix]] [[PC12 minicomputer]]. Word about MUMPS spread mostly through the medical community, and by the early 1970s was in widespread use, often being locally modified for their own needs.

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, there were many and varied implementations of MUMPS on a range of hardware platforms. The most widespread was DEC's MUMPS-11 on the PDP-11, and [[MEDITECH]]'s [[MIIS (programming language)|MIIS]].  In 1972, many MUMPS users attended a conference which standardized the then-fractured language, and created the '''MUMPS Users Group''' and '''MUMPS Development Committee''' (MDC) to do so. These efforts proved successful; a standard was complete by 1974, and was approved, on September 15, 1977, as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard, X11.1-1977.  At about the same time DEC launched DSM-11 (Digital Standard MUMPS) for the PDP-11.  This quickly dominated the market, and became the reference implementation of the time. Also, [[InterSystems]] sold ISM-11 for the PDP-11 (which was identical to DSM-11).

===1980s===
During the early 1980s several vendors brought MUMPS-based platforms that met the ANSI standard to market. The most significant were:
* Digital Equipment Corporation with '''DSM''' (Digital Standard MUMPS). DSM-11 was superseded by '''VAX/DSM''' for the VAX/VMS platform, and that was ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] in two variants: '''DSM for OpenVMS''', and as '''DSM for Ultrix'''.
* [[InterSystems]] with '''ISM''' (InterSystems M) on VMS (M/VX), M/11+ on the PDP-11 platform, M/PC on MS-DOS, M/DG on [[Data General]], M/VM on IBM VM/CMS, and M/UX on various Unixes.

Other companies developed important MUMPS implementations:
* Greystone Technology Corporation with a compiled version called [[GT.M]].
* DataTree Inc. with an Intel PC based product called '''DTM'''.
* Micronetics Design Corporation with a product line called '''MSM''' for UNIX and Intel PC platforms (later ported to IBM's VM [[operating system]], VAX-VMS platforms and Alpha-VMS platforms).
* Computer Consultants (later renamed MGlobal), a [[Houston]]-based company originally created '''CCSM''' on 6800, then 6809, and eventually a port to the 68000, which later became '''MacMUMPS''', a [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] based product. They also worked on the '''MGM''' MUMPS implementation. MGlobal also ported their implementation to the DOS platform. MGlobal MUMPS was the first commercial MUMPS for the IBM PC and the only implementation for the classic Mac OS. 
* [[Tandem Computers]] developed an implementation for their fault-tolerant computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/enterprise/servers/nonstop/SPML_20_January_2012_final.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw considerable MDC activity. The second revision of the ANSI standard for MUMPS (X11.1-1984) was approved on November 15, 1984.

===1990s===
* On November 11, 1990 the third revision of the ANSI standard (X11.1-1990) was approved.
* In 1992 the same standard was also adopted as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 11756-1992. Use of '''M''' as an alternative name for the language was approved around the same time.
* On December 8, 1995 the fourth revision of the standard ([[X11.1-1995]]) was approved by ANSI, and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in 1999 as [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=29268 ISO 11756:1999].  The MDC finalized a further revision to the standard in 1998 but this has not been presented to ANSI for approval.
* InterSystems' Open M for Windows/NT was released, as well as Open M for Alpha/OSF and Alpha/VMS (their first 64-bit implementations, for the 64-bit Alpha processor).
* In 1997 Unicode support was added in InterSystems’ Caché 3.0

===2000s===
* By 2000, the [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] vendor InterSystems had become the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in the early 1990s. And, on December 30, 1995, InterSystems acquired the DSM product line from DEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.mumps/msg/d4509328a7930487 |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; InterSystems consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as '''OpenM'''. In 1997, InterSystems launched a new product named [[Caché (software)|Caché]]. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation assets were also acquired by InterSystems on June 21, 1998. InterSystems remains the dominant MUMPS vendor, selling Caché to MUMPS developers who write applications for a variety of operating systems.
* Greystone Technology Corporation's GT.M implementation was sold to Sanchez Computer Associates (now part of [[Fidelity National Information Services|FIS]]) in the mid-1990s. On November 7, 2000 Sanchez made GT.M for Linux available under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |title=Sanchez to Explore New Business Opportunities for Its Database Technology |publisher=Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. |date=November 7, 2000 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040428215120/http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |archivedate=28 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 28, 2005 GT.M for [[OpenVMS]] and [[Tru64 UNIX]] were also made available under the AGPL license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/ |title=GT.M High end TP database engine - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; GT.M continues to be available on other [[UNIX]] platforms under a traditional license.
* During 2000, Ray Newman and others released MUMPS V1, an implementation of MUMPS (initially on FreeBSD) similar to DSM-11.  MUMPS V1 has since been ported to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (using cygwin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/ |title=MUMPS Database and Language - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially only for the x86 CPU, MUMPS V1 has now been ported to the Raspberry Pi.
* The newest implementation of MUMPS, released in April 2002, is an '''MSM''' derivative called '''M21''' from the Real Software Company of Rugby, [[UK]].
* There are also several open source implementations of MUMPS, including some research projects. The most notable of these is [http://www.cs.uni.edu/~okane Mumps/II], by Dr. Kevin O'Kane (Professor Emeritus, [[University of Northern Iowa]]) and students' project. Dr. O'Kane has also ported the interpreter to Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rychannel.com/mumps |title=Mumps/Mii |publisher=Rychannel.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the original creators of the MUMPS language, Neil Pappalardo, early founded a company called [[MEDITECH]]. They extended and built on the MUMPS language, naming the new language MIIS (and later, another language named MAGIC). Unlike InterSystems, MEDITECH no longer sells middleware, so MIIS and MAGIC are now only used internally at MEDITECH.
* On 6 January 2005, and later again on 25 June 2010, ISO re-affirmed its MUMPS-related standards: [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29268&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=&amp;scopelist ISO/IEC 11756:1999, language standard], [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29269&amp;printable=true ISO/IEC 15851:1999, Open MUMPS Interconnect] and [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?printable=true&amp;CSNUMBER=29270 ISO/IEC 15852:1999, MUMPS Windowing Application Programmers Interface].

==Current users of MUMPS applications==
The US Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration) was one of the earliest major adopters of the MUMPS language.  Their development work (and subsequent contributions to the free MUMPS application codebase) was an influence on many medical users worldwide. In 1995, the Veterans Affairs' patient Admission/Tracking/Discharge system, [[Decentralized Hospital Computer Program]] (DHCP) was the recipient of the Computerworld [[Smithsonian Award]] for best use of Information Technology in Medicine. In July 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) was the recipient of the Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] for its extension of DHCP into the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]). Nearly the entire VA hospital system in the United States, the [[Indian Health Service]], and major parts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[CHCS]] hospital system use MUMPS databases for clinical data tracking. In 2015 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] awarded a 10 year contract to [[Leidos]], [[Cerner]], and [[Accenture]] to replace [[CHCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/dod-names-ehr-contract-winner|title=DoD awards Cerner, Leidos, Accenture EHR contract|date=29 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) announced that it would replace [[VistA]] with [[Cerner]] by 2024 or 2025. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthexec.com/topics/health-it/cerner-ehr-implementation-va-take-%E2%80%9C7-8-years%E2%80%9D|title=Cerner EHR implementation at VA to take '7 to 8 years'|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That contract did not affect the 2015 VHA contract for an online appointment scheduling from [[Epic Systems|Epic]], so the VHA will continue to use MUMPS. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ehrintelligence.com/news/epic-keeps-va-scheduling-contract-despite-cerner-decision|title=Epic Keeps VA Scheduling Contract Despite Cerner Decision|first=|last=EHRIntelligence|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other healthcare IT companies using MUMPS include [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[MEDITECH]], [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly [[IDX Systems Corporation|IDX]] Systems and [[Centricity]]), AmeriPath (part of Quest Diagnostics), Care Centric, [[Allscripts]], [[Coventry Healthcare]], [[EMIS Health|EMIS]], and [[Sunquest Information Systems]] (formerly Misys Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sunquest-emerges-misys-shadow |title=SunQuest emerges from Misys' shadow |publisher=Healthcare IT News |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Many reference laboratories, such as DASA, [[Quest Diagnostics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/missioncritical-ajaxmaking-test-ordering-easier-and-faster-at-quest-diagnostics?type=powerpoint |title=Mission-critical Ajax: Making Test Ordering Easier and Faster at Qu |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dynacare, use MUMPS software written by or based on Antrim Corporation code. Antrim was purchased by Misys Healthcare (now [[Sunquest Information Systems]]) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sunquest+acquires+Antrim+Corp.-a018916869 |title=Sunquest acquires Antrim Corp. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUMPS is also widely used in financial applications. MUMPS gained an early following in the financial sector and is in use at many banks and credit unions. It is used by [[Ameritrade]], the largest online trading service in the US, with over 12 billion transactions per day, as well as by the [[Bank of England]] and [[Barclays Bank]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m21.uk.com/newtom.php|title=Welcome to M21 -- the database for the 21st Century|publisher=M21.uk.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intersystems.com/industry/financial/intersystems-in-financial.html|title=Caché-based Financial Systems|publisher=Intersystems.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.cz/company/references|title=IDEA Turn-Key banking and ERP applications|publisher=Idea.cz|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the use of MUMPS has been either in the form of GT.M or InterSystems Caché. The latter is being aggressively marketed by InterSystems and has had success in penetrating new markets, such as telecommunications, in addition to existing markets. The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010 that it will use the [[InterSystems Caché]] database to support the [[Gaia mission]].  This mission aims to map the [[Milky Way]] with unprecedented precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realwire.com/release_detail.asp?ReleaseID=18645|title=European Space Agency Chooses InterSystems Caché Database For Gaia Mission to Map Milky Way|publisher=Realwire.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
MUMPS is a language intended for and designed to build database applications.  Secondary language features were included to help programmers make applications using minimal computing resources.  The original implementations were [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]], though modern implementations may be fully or partially [[Compiler|compiled]]. Individual "programs" run in memory [[Memory management (operating systems)#Partitioned allocation|"partitions"]].  Early MUMPS memory partitions were limited to 2048 bytes so aggressive abbreviation greatly aided multi-programming on severely resource limited hardware, because more than one MUMPS job could fit into the very small memories extant in hardware at the time. The ability to provide multi-user systems was another language design feature. The word "'''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming" in the acronym points to this. Even the earliest machines running MUMPS supported multiple jobs running at the same time. With the change from mini-computers to micro-computers a
few years later, even a "single user PC" with a single 8-bit CPU and 16K or 64K of memory could support multiple users, who could connect to it from (non-[[GUI|graphical]]) [[Computer terminal|video display terminals]].

Since memory was tight originally, the language design for MUMPS valued very terse code. Thus, every MUMPS command or function name could be abbreviated from one to three letters in length, e.g. Quit (exit program) as Q, $P = $Piece function, R = Read command, $TR = $Translate function. Spaces and end-of-line markers are significant in MUMPS because line scope promoted the same terse language design. Thus, a single line of program code could express, with few characters, an idea for which other programming languages could require 5 to 10 times as many characters.  Abbreviation was a common feature of languages designed in this period (e.g., [[FOCAL-69]], early BASICs such as [[Tiny BASIC]], etc.).  An unfortunate side effect of this, coupled with the early need to write minimalist code, was that MUMPS programmers routinely did not comment code and used extensive abbreviations.  This meant that even an expert MUMPS programmer could not just skim through a page of code to see its function but would have to
analyze it line by line.

Database interaction is transparently built into the language. The MUMPS language provides a [[hierarchical database model|hierarchical database]] made up of [[persistence (computer science)|persistent]] [[sparse array]]s, which is implicitly "opened" for every MUMPS application.  All variable names prefixed with the caret character ("^") use permanent (instead of RAM) storage, will maintain their values after the application exits, and will be visible to (and modifiable by) other running applications.  Variables using this shared and permanent storage are called ''Globals'' in MUMPS, because the scoping of these variables is "globally available" to all jobs on the system. The more recent and more common use of the name "global variables" in other languages is a more limited scoping of names, coming from the fact that [[Variable scoping|unscoped variables]] are "globally" available to any programs running in the same process, but not shared among multiple processes. The MUMPS Storage mode (i.e. Globals
stored as persistent sparse arrays), gives the MUMPS database the characteristics of a [[document-oriented database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/extreme1.pdf|title=Extreme Database programming with MUMPS Globals|publisher=Gradvs1.mjgateway.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All variable names which are not prefixed with caret character ("^") are temporary and private. Like global variables, they also have a hierarchical storage model, but are only "locally available" to a single job, thus they are called "locals".  Both "globals" and "locals" can have child nodes (called ''subscripts'' in MUMPS terminology).  Subscripts are not limited to numerals—any [[ASCII]] character or group of characters can be a subscript identifier. While this is not uncommon for modern languages such as Perl or JavaScript, it was a highly unusual feature in the late 1970s. This capability was not universally implemented in MUMPS systems before the 1984 ANSI standard, as only canonically numeric subscripts were required by the standard to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd?Frame=Main&amp;Page=a202005&amp;Edition=1977 |title=The Annotated M[UMPS&amp;#93; Standards |publisher=71.174.62.16 |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the variable named 'Car' can have
subscripts "Door", "Steering Wheel" and "Engine", each of which can contain a value and have subscripts of their own.  The variable ^Car("Door") could have a nested variable subscript of "Color" for example. Thus, you could say

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET ^Car("Door","Color")="BLUE"
&lt;/source&gt;

to modify a nested child node of ^Car.  In MUMPS terms, "Color" is the 2nd subscript of the variable ^Car (both the names of the child-nodes and the child-nodes themselves are likewise called subscripts).  Hierarchical variables are similar to objects with properties in many [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] languages.  Additionally, the MUMPS language design requires that all subscripts of variables are automatically kept in sorted order.  Numeric subscripts (including floating-point numbers) are stored from lowest to highest.  All non-numeric subscripts are stored in alphabetical order following the numbers.  In MUMPS terminology, this is ''canonical order''.  By using only non-negative integer subscripts, the MUMPS programmer can emulate the [[Array data type|arrays]] data type from other languages.  Although MUMPS does not natively offer a full set of [[Database Management System|DBMS]] features such as mandatory schemas, several DBMS systems have been built on top of it that provide
application developers with flat-file, relational and network database features.

Additionally, there are built-in operators which treat a delimited string (e.g., [[comma-separated values]]) as an array. Early MUMPS programmers would often store a structure of related information as a delimited string, parsing it after it was read in; this saved disk access time and offered considerable speed advantages on some hardware.

MUMPS has no data types. Numbers can be treated as strings of digits, or strings can be treated as numbers by numeric operators (''coerced'', in MUMPS terminology). Coercion can have some odd side effects, however. For example, when a string is coerced, the parser turns as much of the string (starting from the left) into a number as it can, then discards the rest.  Thus the statement &lt;code&gt;IF 20&lt;"30 DUCKS"&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; in MUMPS.

Other features of the language are intended to help MUMPS applications interact with each other in a multi-user environment. Database locks, process identifiers, and [[atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]] of database update transactions are all required of standard MUMPS implementations.

In contrast to languages in the C or [[Niklaus Wirth#Programming languages|Wirth]] traditions, some space characters between MUMPS statements are significant. A single space separates a command from its argument, and a space, or newline, separates each argument from the next MUMPS token. Commands which take no arguments (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt;) require two following spaces. The concept is that one space separates the command from the (nonexistent) argument, the next separates the "argument" from the next command. Newlines are also significant; an &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt; command processes (or skips) everything else till the end-of-line. To make those statements control multiple lines, you must use the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; command to create a code block.

=="Hello, World!" example==

A simple [[Hello world program]] in MUMPS might be:
	
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello()
  write "Hello, World!",!
  quit
&lt;/source&gt;

and would be run from the MUMPS command line with the command &lt;code&gt;do ^hello&lt;/code&gt;. Since MUMPS allows commands to be strung together on the same line, and since commands can be abbreviated to a single letter, this routine could be made more compact:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello() w "Hello, World!",! q
&lt;/source&gt;

The '&lt;code&gt;,!&lt;/code&gt;' after the text generates a newline.

==Summary of key language features==
{{Main|MUMPS syntax}}
ANSI X11.1-1995 gives a complete, formal description of the language; an annotated version of this standard is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd|title=The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards|website=71.174.62.16|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data types''': There is one universal [[datatype]], which is implicitly [[Type conversion|coerced]] to string, integer, or floating-point datatypes as context requires.

'''Booleans''' (called ''truthvalues'' in MUMPS): In IF commands and other syntax that has expressions evaluated as conditions, any string value is evaluated as a numeric value, and if that is a nonzero value, then it is interpreted as True.  &lt;code&gt; a&amp;lt;b &lt;/code&gt; yields 1 if a is less than b, 0 otherwise.

'''Declarations''': None. All variables are dynamically created at the first time a value is assigned.

'''Lines''': are important syntactic entities, unlike their status in languages patterned on C or Pascal. Multiple statements per line are allowed and are common. The scope of any IF, ELSE, and FOR command is "the remainder of current line."

'''Case sensitivity''': Commands and intrinsic functions are case-insensitive. In contrast, variable names and labels are case-sensitive.  There is no special meaning for upper vs. lower-case and few widely followed conventions. The percent sign (%) is legal as first character of variables and labels.

'''Postconditionals''': execution of almost any command can be controlled by following it with a colon and a truthvalue expression. &lt;code&gt;SET:N&lt;10 A="FOO"&lt;/code&gt;  sets A to "FOO" if N is less than 10; &lt;code&gt;DO:N&gt;100 PRINTERR,&lt;/code&gt; performs PRINTERR if N is greater than 100. This construct provides a conditional whose scope is less than a full line.

'''Abbreviation''': You can abbreviate nearly all commands and native functions to one, two, or three characters.

'''Reserved words''': None.  Since MUMPS interprets source code by context, there is no need for reserved words. You may use the names of language commands as variables. There has been no contest such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] for MUMPS, despite the potential of examples such as the following, perfectly legal, MUMPS code:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       NEW SET,NEW,THEN,IF,KILL,QUIT SET IF="KILL",SET="11",KILL="l1",QUIT="RETURN",THEN="KILL"
       IF IF=THEN DO THEN
       QUIT:$QUIT QUIT QUIT ; (quit)
THEN  IF IF,SET&amp;KILL SET SET=SET+KILL QUIT
&lt;/source&gt;

MUMPS can be made more obfuscated by using the contracted operator syntax, as shown in this terse example derived from the example above:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       N S,N,T,I,K,Q S I="K",S="11",K="l1",Q="R",T="K"
       I I=T D T
       Q:$Q Q Q
T  I I,S&amp;K S S=S+K Q
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Arrays''': are created dynamically, stored as [[B-trees]], are sparse (i.e. use almost no space for missing nodes), can use any number of subscripts, and subscripts can be strings or numeric (including floating point). Arrays are always automatically stored in sorted order, so there is never any occasion to sort, pack, reorder, or otherwise reorganize the database. Built in functions such as $DATA, $ORDER, $NEXT(deprecated) and $QUERY functions provide efficient examination and traversal of the fundamental array structure, on disk or in memory.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
for i=10000:1:12345 set sqtable(i)=i*i
set address("Smith","Daniel")="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Local arrays''': variable names not beginning with caret (i.e. "^") are stored in memory by process, are private to the creating process, and expire when the creating process terminates. The available storage depends on implementation. For those implementations using partitions, it is limited to the partition size, (A small partition might be 32K). For other implementations, it may be several megabytes.

'''Global arrays''': &lt;code&gt;^abc, ^def&lt;/code&gt;. These are stored on disk, are available to all processes, and are persistent when the creating process terminates. Very large globals (for example, hundreds of gigabytes) are practical and efficient in most implementations. This is MUMPS' main "database" mechanism. It is used instead of calling on the operating system to create, write, and read files.

'''Indirection''': in many contexts, &lt;code&gt;@VBL&lt;/code&gt; can be used, and effectively substitutes the contents of VBL into another MUMPS statement. &lt;code&gt;SET XYZ="ABC" SET @XYZ=123&lt;/code&gt; sets the variable ABC to 123. &lt;code&gt;SET SUBROU="REPORT" DO @SUBROU&lt;/code&gt; performs the subroutine named REPORT. This substitution allows for [[lazy evaluation]] and late binding as well as effectively the operational equivalent of "pointers" in other languages.

'''Piece function''': This breaks variables into segmented pieces guided by a user specified separator string (sometimes called a "delimiter"). Those who know [[awk]] will find this familiar. &lt;code&gt;$PIECE(STRINGVAR,"^",3)&lt;/code&gt; means the "third caret-separated piece of STRINGVAR." The piece function can also appear as an assignment (SET command) target.

&lt;code&gt;$PIECE("world.std.com",".",2)&lt;/code&gt; yields "std".

After
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET X="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;SET $P(X,"@",1)="office"&lt;/code&gt; causes X to become "office@world.std.com" (note that $P is equivalent to $PIECE and could be written as such).

'''Order function''': This function treats its input as a structure, and finds the next index that exists which has the same structure except for the last subscript. It returns the sorted value that is ordered after the one given as input. (This treats the array reference as a content-addressable data rather than an address of a value)

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set stuff(6)="xyz",stuff(10)=26,stuff(15)=""
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(""))&lt;/code&gt; yields 6, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(6))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(8))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(10))&lt;/code&gt; yields 15, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(15))&lt;/code&gt; yields "".

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set i="" For  Set i=$O(stuff(i)) Quit:i=""  Write !,i,10,stuff(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the argument-less ''For'' repeats until stopped by a terminating ''Quit''.  This line prints a table of i and stuff(i) where i is successively 6, 10, and 15.

For iterating the database, the Order function returns the next key to use.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GTM&gt;S n=""
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" building"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" name:gd"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n="%kml:guid"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Multi-User/Multi-Tasking/Multi-Processor''': MUMPS supports multiple simultaneous users and processes even when the underlying operating system does not (e.g., MS-DOS).  Additionally, there is the ability to specify an environment for a variable, such as by specifying a machine name in a variable (as in &lt;code&gt;SET ^|"DENVER"|A(1000)="Foo"&lt;/code&gt;), which can allow you to access data on remote machines.

==Criticism==
Some aspects of MUMPS syntax differ strongly from that of more modern languages, which can cause confusion. Whitespace is not allowed within expressions, as it ends a statement: &lt;code&gt;2 + 3&lt;/code&gt; is an error, and must be written &lt;code&gt;2+3&lt;/code&gt;. All operators have the same precedence and are [[Operator associativity|left-associative]] (&lt;code&gt;2+3*10&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 50). The operators for "less than or equal to" and "greater than or equal to" are &lt;code&gt;'&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (that is, the boolean negation operator &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; plus a strict comparison operator).

MUMPS lacks a while statement; a GOTO statement can be used to simulate one. By default, the IF, ELSE, and FOR statements use the rest of the line as their block. The DO statement allows one of them to span multiple lines; periods (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) are used to indent the lines in a DO block. The ELSE statement does not need a corresponding IF, as it operates by inspecting the value in the builtin system variable &lt;code&gt;$test&lt;/code&gt;.

MUMPS [[Scope (computer science)|scoping]] rules are more permissive than other modern languages. Declared local variables are scoped using the stack. A routine can normally see all declared locals of the routines below it on the call stack, and routines cannot prevent routines they call from modifying their declared locals. By contrast, undeclared variables (variables created by using them, rather than declaration) are in scope for all routines running in the same process, and remain in scope until the program exits.

=="MUMPS" vs. "M" naming debate==
{{Cite-section|date=October 2018}}
All of the following positions can be, and have been, supported by knowledgeable people at various times:
*The language's name became M in 1993 when the M Technology Association adopted it.
*The name became M on December 8, 1995, with the approval of ANSI X11.1-1995
*Both M ''and'' MUMPS are officially accepted names.
*M is only an "alternative name" or "nickname" for the language, and MUMPS is still the official name.

Some of the contention arose in response to strong M advocacy on the part of one commercial interest, InterSystems, whose chief executive disliked the name MUMPS and felt that it represented a serious marketing obstacle. Thus, favoring M to some extent became identified as alignment with InterSystems. The dispute also reflected rivalry between organizations (the M Technology Association, the MUMPS Development Committee, the ANSI and ISO Standards Committees) as to who determines the "official" name of the language. Some writers have attempted to defuse the issue by referring to the language as ''M[UMPS]'', square brackets being the customary notation for optional syntax elements. A leading authority, and the author of an open source MUMPS implementation, Professor Kevin O'Kane, uses only 'MUMPS'.

The most recent standard (ISO/IEC 11756:1999, re-affirmed on 25 June 2010), still mentions both M and MUMPS as officially accepted names.

=== Trademark status ===
[[Massachusetts General Hospital]] registered "MUMPS" as a trademark with the USPTO on November 28, 1971, and renewed it on November 16, 1992 - but let it expired on August 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=72382020&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Pick==
MUMPS invites comparison with the [[Pick operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1980's "shootout" had Pick "still going after 30" minutes whereas MUMPS had 
finished sort 100,000 "in less than a minute."{{cite web
|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04639.html |title=BIG NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities include:

* Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;
* Both historically commingled the language and the OS;
* Both have a similar domain of applicability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">A '''maternity hospital''' specializes in caring for women during [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. It also provides care for newborn [[infant]]s, and may act as a centre for clinical training in [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]]. Formerly known as [[lying-in]] hospitals, most of them, like [[cottage hospital]]s, have been absorbed into larger [[general hospital]]s, where they operate as the maternity department.

==History==
[[File:General Lying-in Hospital ES.jpg|thumb|The premises of the former [[General Lying-In Hospital]], now a hotel]]
Maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom can be traced back to a number of 18th century establishments in London and Dublin. Prior to these foundations, childbirth was a domestic occasion. The term coined for these establishments, but now [[archaism|archaic]], is "a lying-in hospital", referring to the custom of [[lying-in]], prolonged [[bedrest]] after childbirth, better known now as [[postpartum confinement]].

The first noted lying-in hospital appears to be one founded by Sir [[Richard Manningham]] in [[Jermyn Street]], London, in 1739 and which evolved into the [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital]]. A better documented foundation is that of the [[Rotunda Hospital|Dublin Lying-In Hospital]], established in 1745 by [[Bartholomew Mosse]], and which served as a model for three subsequent London foundations: the [[British Lying-In Hospital]], a 1749 establishment in [[Holborn]]; the 1750 [[City of London Maternity Hospital|City of London Lying-In Hospital]], in [[City of London|the City]]; and the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] on [[Westminster Bridge Road]], established in 1767.&lt;ref name="AIM25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11905&amp;inst_id=118|website=AIM25 - Archives in London and the M25 area|title=Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Leaflet Number 35 Records of patients in London hospitals|website=London Metropolitan Archives|publisher=City of London|accessdate=3 September 2016|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/35-records-of-patients-in-london-hospitals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofqueench00ryan |title=The history of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital |first=Thomas |last=Ryan |date=1885|pages=ix-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other such hospitals were formed in the mid-18th century. All of these were run by male physicians, women being blocked from completing training as doctors until the 1870s. 

The first maternity hospital founded and run by a woman was [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]]'s [[New Hospital for Women]], which evolved from an existing dispensary in the 1770s, and was renamed in 1918 the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital.&lt;ref name="UCLH"&gt;[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our+hospitals/university+college+hospital+elizabeth+garrett+anderson+wing.htm UCLH - Our hospitals - University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051037/http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/Our+hospitals/University+College+Hospital+Elizabeth+Garrett+Anderson+Wing.htm |date=2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2007-10-28 | title='Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | last=Elston | first=Mary Ann | format=pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707212420/http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rodopi/clio/2001/00000061/00000001/art00007 | title = 'Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | publisher = [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] | accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3197216 | title = Elizabeth Garrett Anderson - Victorian Women's Campaigner | publisher = [[BBC]] |date=December 2004 | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work continues in the modern Elizabeth Garrett Anderson maternity wing of [[University College Hospital]], part of UCLH NHS Foundation Trust.

==Today==
The [[Portland Hospital]] in central London was created in 1983 as a [[private hospital]], i.e. not part of the [[National Health Service]]. Also in 1983, the [[Rosie Hospital]] opened in Cambridge, next to [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]].

The [[National Maternity Hospital, Dublin]] is the largest mother-and-baby hospital in Ireland.

'''Mental health inequality''' refers to the differences in quality of [[mental health]] and mental health care for different identities and populations. Mental health can be defined as well-being and/or the absence of clinically defined [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2003) Investing in mental health. Geneva, World Health Organization (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/investing_mnh.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; ).&lt;/ref&gt; There are social economic factors that influence individuals or groups of people of a certain demographic. This can be a factor to mental health care access. Inequalities may include presence of mental health, access to mental health care, quality of mental health care, and mental health outcomes between populations with different [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], sex, [[gender]], [[socioeconomic status]]es, education level, and geographic location.

Social determinants of health are factors such as economic status, education level, demographics, where you live and genetics that can influence one's health. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/hsnsw/Publications/classifications-project.pdf|title=Public Health Determinants of health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to experiences certain populations are much more susceptible to mental disorders or illnesses. Traumatic experiences can develop by the lack of resources of the determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1797101|title=Are the brown and Harris vulnerable factors for depression ?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not having employment or being from a certain area where those resources are limited trigger some of the most common mental disorders. ( Depression, anxiety, bipolar, psychological stress)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness#1|title=Types of Mental Illness|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health within itself leads to the inequality among the social determinants of health. The economic level of one's life is a factor to their life expectancy and mental health. For example lung cancer is by far the most preventable disease yet the rates of consumption of tobacco just increase. Ironically the consumers are those with mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e557702010-001|title=Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain, 2004|last=Green|first=Hazel|last2=McGinnity|first2=Ainee|date=2005|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-10-14|last3=Meltzer|first3=Howard|last4=Ford|first4=Tamsin|last5=Goodman|first5=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education disparities ===
While education and mental health seem mutually exclusive, there is a significant parallel between the inequities. Educational disparities can be defined as unjust or unfair differences in educational outcomes that can be a result of difference in treatment of certain minority groups in schools, varying socioeconomic statuses, and varying educational needs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2012|title=Ethnic and Racial Disparities in Education: Psychology's Contributions to Understanding and Reducing Disparities|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/resources/racial-disparities.pdf|journal=American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities in education can ultimately lead to issues of mental health. When this happens, less privileged groups get looped into the cascading effects of inequality.

The disparities that arise in education do not happen by chance. There are definitely predictors that factor into these inequalities. Some common ones are socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and ethnic/racial status.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Socioeconomic status plays a large role in the difference in access to educational resources. School districts are split geographically. Because the current funding for public schools comes from local property taxes, there is more incentive for high-status individuals to narrow the boundaries to not include lower income families from their school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenotebook.org/articles/2016/08/23/study-examines-how-school-district-borders-exacerbate-school-segregation|title=Study examines how district boundaries exacerbate school segregation|website=thenotebook.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each school district is then only encompassing one socioeconomic group, the programs and quality are affected. This is where we begin to see the dramatic differences between school districts. While some schools offer amazing guidance departments, advanced classes, and phenomenal facilities, other areas struggle to find qualified and motivated teachers to teach basic classes. Although public education is something that is supposed to be a right for all, an individual's socioeconomic status can greatly affect the quality of that education.

An individual's immigration status also affects the quality of education received. While there are some immigrant groups which do well after immigrating to the United States, many do not have the same level of success. There are many barriers that prevent the academic success of immigrant children. These barriers include but are not limited to the fact that most parents of immigrant children do not understand the United States educational system, inadequate English as a Second Language programs, and segregation. There are also differences in outcomes across immigrant generation, with first-generation immigrants performing better than subsequent generations. This is termed the [[immigrant paradox]]. These issues along with the psychological effects of [[acculturation]] (e.g., adapting to a whole new country, language, and culture) amplify educational inequality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Disparities in education are the insufficiency of resources that are included but limited. These disparities usually targets socially excluded communities with low income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/|title=Unequal Opportunity: Race and Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics are used when measuring grades, GPA, test scores, and dropout rates to determine the success of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/003465430303947|title=Race, School &amp;. Achievement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities as such affect somones mental health by creating a system in which a person could never succeed.

=== Spatial disparities (geographic location) ===
Further research observes that those minority races living in areas of low-poverty have more and easier access to mental health services than those in high-poverty neighborhoods. There is a pattern of people in high-poverty areas being unable escape this cycle. Due to these conditions, inequality remains and they are unable to gain access to mental health care which can be very beneficial to those who may be suffering from stress due to lack of resources and money.

Many minorities including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans inhabit these poverty filled neighborhoods due to factors being not in their favor in certain aspects of society. These neighborhoods lack resources such as offices with psychiatrists or health clinics with good doctors who are trained to help those in need of mental health care. It would also be beneficial to make specific services just for those in high-poverty neighborhoods who lack the resources so we can encourage those in need to get the help that they deserve. With adjustments made to meet these circumstances, the spatial disparities can be lowered and allow those who need the help to get it.

=== Ethnic and racial disparities ===
There is inequality in mental health care access for different races and ethnicities. It is known through much research that even poor minorities have less access to mental health care than poor non-Latino whites.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alegría|first=Margarita|last2=Canino|first2=Glorisa|last3=Ríos|first3=Ruth|last4=Vera|first4=Mildred|last5=Calderón|first5=José|last6=Rusch|first6=Dana|last7=Ortega|first7=Alexander N.|date=2002-12-01|title=Mental Health Care for Latinos: Inequalities in Use of Specialty Mental Health Services Among Latinos, African Americans, and Non-Latino Whites|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1547–1555|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is also known that blacks have even less of a chance to access to mental health services and care than those who are white.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many of these minorities may confront an issue directly resulting in the search for mental health care support, yet they don't have the same access as other people.

After surveying people of different races over years we observe that African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans gain less access to the same type of mental services that non-minority whites get access to.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Julian Chun-Chung|last2=Jaffee|first2=Kim|last3=Snowden|first3=Lonnie|date=2017-04-07|year=|title=Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Mental Health Services in Poverty Areas|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=5|pages=792–797|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1447841|pmid=12721146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this research there was a piece that stated:

"This theory postulates that Whites have a greater propensity to avoid living in poverty communities because they are more likely to enjoy social and economic advantages. Only seriously mentally ill Whites suffer from steep downward mobility and come to reside in high-poverty neighborhoods"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; (Julian Chun-Chung Chow, Kim Jaffee, and Lonnie Snowden).

This has been a problem for minority races that need the same services. It is an issue because African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans need the services more in certain areas due to how biologically certain minority races are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than whites.

=== LGBTQ disparities and predictors ===
{{See also|LGBTQ psychology}}
Sexuality plays a large role in the prediction of mental illnesses and overall mental health. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer have a higher risk of having mental health issues, most likely as a result of the continued discrimination and victimization they receive at the hands of others. Members of this population are confronted with derogatory and hateful comments, whether through face-to-face communication or through [[social media]], which affects their self-worth and confidence, leading to anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide. These mental health effects are most commonly seen among adolescents, however, they are also prevalent among adults of all ages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=U-M Weblogin|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x | volume=23|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing|pages=205–213 | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian S.|last2=Garofalo|first2=Robert|last3=Emerson|first3=Erin M.|title=Mental Health Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality in a Diverse Sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youths|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.178319|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=100|issue=12|pages=2426–2432|doi=10.2105/ajph.2009.178319|pmc=2978194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of discrimination and victimization that the [[LGBTQ]] population suffers from can be both external and internal. While parts of society today are not accepting of the LGBTQ community and make public statements to advertise their discontent, an identifying LGBTQ can also have low confidence and a lack of self-worth that furthers these negative mental health effects.

The most notable predictor of mental health illnesses among the LGBTQ population is family acceptance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Those of the LGBTQ population who receive little or no family support and acceptance are three times more likely to have thoughts of suicide than those who do have a strong family support system behind them. Oftentimes, the lack of familial support is more conducive of detrimental behaviors, such as drug and illegal substance abuse, which can cause further harm to the individual. Multiple aspects of lifestyles, including religion, can affect family support. Those who have strong family ties to religion may be less likely to seek support and help from family members due to fear of a lack of acceptance within the family, as well as within the religious community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sex and gender disparities and predictors ===
While [[Mental disorders and gender|gender differences among those with mental health disorders]] are an underdeveloped field of study, there are gender specific aspects to life that cause disparities. Gender is often a determinant of the amount of power one has over factors in their life, such as socioeconomic status and social position, and the stressors that go along with these factors. The location of genders and sex within the social construct can be a great determinant of risks and predictors of mental health disorders. These disparities in gender can correlate to the disparities in the types of mental health disorders that individuals have. While all genders and sexes are at risk of a large variety of mental health illnesses, some illnesses and disorders are more common among one sex than another. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with forms of depression, whereas men are three times more likely to be given a diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder than women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Gender and women's mental health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex can also be a determinant of other aspects of mental health as well. The time of onset of symptoms can be different dependent on one's sex. Women are more likely to show signs of mental illnesses, such as depression, earlier and at a younger age than men. Many believe this to be a correlation with the onset time of puberty. As a result of social stigmatisms and stereotypes within society, women are also more likely to be prescribed mood-altering medications, whereas men are more likely to be prescribed medications for addictions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further research on the mental health disparities among sex and gender is needed in order to gain a deeper knowledge of the predictors of mental health and the possible differences in treatments.

== Disparities in success to mental health care ==
Over the past decade, many of the disparities regarding mental health stem from differences in racial/ethnic groups. Mental illness is one of the highest health burdens for minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin Lê|last2=Trinh|first2=Nhi-Ha|last3=Li|first3=Zhihui|last4=Hou|first4=Sherry Shu-Yeu|last5=Progovac|first5=Ana M.|title=Trends in Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Access to Mental Health Care, 2004–2012|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201500453|journal=Psychiatric Services|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=9–16|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201500453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many minority groups, certain mental illnesses are under and over diagnosed. For example, schizophrenia is over diagnosed in African Americans while mood disorders, depression, and anxiety are under diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is due to a variety of reasons. The recognition of mental illness is often thought of in conjunction with stereotypes regarding African Americans. Those who present symptoms exhibiting depression and mood swings may be mistaken as stereotypically violent.

While the diagnosis of these minority groups is vastly different, the care they receive also varies between whites and minority groups. This is not only due to external factors and facilities but also the way in which these minority groups choose to proceed with treatment. African Americans generally do receive care from lower quality facilities, but they are also more likely than whites to terminate treatment prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Thomas G.|last2=Miranda|first2=Jeanne|date=2008-01-01|year=|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care: Evidence and Policy Implications|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=27|issue=2|pages=393–403|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.27.2.393|issn=0278-2715|pmc=3928067|pmid=18332495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, health care plans are also a major contributor to the inequities in mental health care access. Provider discrimination involves health care providers unfairly using stereotypes to decide how to distribute diagnoses. Physicians often rely on common stereotypes of individuals in deciding treatment, which ultimately leads to minority groups not getting the specialized treatment required to diagnose and treat mental illness.

== Disparities in quality of mental health care ==
There is a growing unmet need for mental health services and equity in the quality of these services. While these services often advertise themselves as being a support system and caregiver for any and all who need treatment or support, oftentimes certain aspects of an individual's life, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, will determine the type of care that they are given.

Due to a growing level of socioeconomic inequality among races, African Americans are less likely to have access to mental health care and are more likely to have lesser quality care when they do find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin L.|last2=McGuire|first2=Thomas|last3=Miranda|first3=Jeanne|date=2007-12-01|title=Measuring Trends in Mental Health Care Disparities, 2000–2004|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=58|issue=12|pages=1533–1540|doi=10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to be uninsured or have [[Medicaid]], limiting the amount and type of access that they have mental health outpatient sources. In one study, of all those who received mental health care, minority populations reported a higher degree of unmet needs and dissatisfaction with the services they were given (12.5% of whites, 25.4% of African Americans, and 22.6% of Hispanics reported poor care).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Kenneth|last2=Klap|first2=Ruth|last3=Koike|first3=Alan|last4=Sherbourne|first4=Cathy|date=2001-12-01|title=Ethnic Disparities in Unmet Need for Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Care|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2027–2032|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBTQ population, while still open to the same disparities as racial minority groups, is often confronted with the problem of being denied mental health treatment because of the gender they identify as or their sexual orientation. In a study conducted by The National Center for Transgender Equality and the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], 19% of the LGBTQ sample reported being denied the healthcare they needed. In addition, 28% of the sample reported being harassed or even physically assaulted during the health visit.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tab-6-Supplements-Web.pdf|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on health and health care|last=|first=|date=National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While denial of treatment and harassment during treatment are large causes of the disparities among mental health care quality, the lack of knowledge is also of concern among the LGBTQ population. As it is such a newly developing field of study, there is very little knowledge or research conducted that relate specifically to LGBTQ health and healthcare. Because of this, about 50% of the LGBTQ population report having to teach aspects of their health and treatment to the health care providers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Suggestions on how to achieve better mental health equality ==
Because mental health inequality is largely due to disparities in health insurance, ways to improve mental health equity must come from changes in healthcare policies. While much of mental health disparities comes from improving access to healthcare for the underprivileged. The biggest reason why people are not obtaining mental health care is because they cannot afford it. Also, changing the content of healthcare literature to include mental health is equally important. The United States has made massive strides to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health. Given that, mental health is still not considered to be a main part of basic health care plans. In order for individuals to receive the treatment necessary for mental illness, it must be acknowledged as an illness.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707963#vp_2|title=Disparities in Access to Mental Health Services by African Americans: An Expert Interview With Annelle B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10183">The '''National Occupational Research Agenda''' (NORA) is a partnership program developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH). The program was founded in 1996 to provide a framework for research collaborations among universities, large and small businesses, professional societies, government agencies, and worker organizations. Together these parties identify issues in the field of [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety and health]] that require immediate attention based on the number of workers affected, the seriousness of the hazard, and the likelihood that new safety information and approaches can effect a change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/NORA/ National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA)], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved on 2008-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing the first research agenda==

Dr. [[Linda Rosenstock]] was appointed director of NIOSH in 1994. At that time many saw the Institute as an agency that yielded strong scientific research, but needed stronger connections to the real-world workforce.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/magazine/winter2001.pdf "From Washington to Westwood: New Dean Brings Her Public Health Vision to UCLA"], ''UCLA School of Public Health Newsletter'' Volume 21, Number 1, Winter 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; To remedy this, Rosenstock sought to develop stronger relationships with other organizations and agencies. NIOSH moved its headquarters from [[Atlanta]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], where the Institute could enjoy closer contact with labor and industry representatives.&lt;ref name="washam"&gt;Washam, Cynthia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1469368/pdf/envhper00336-0032-color.pdf "Working Toward a New NIOSH"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' Volume 104, Number 5, May 1996. Retrieved on 2008-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;  NIOSH's effort to build partnerships inside and outside of the government culminated in the development of the National Occupational Research Agenda. 

To form the agenda, NIOSH leaders petitioned stakeholders in industry, labor, and health care for input. Organizations including [[General Motors]], [[IBM]], [[Mobil]], the [[United Auto Workers]], and the [[American Public Health Association]] joined NIOSH in developing the agenda. NIOSH sought additional aid through a series of public town meetings held in [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=washam/&gt; In total, nearly 500 organizations and individuals provided the input that resulted in the research agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstock, Linda.

==NORA in practice==

NIOSH announced NORA's 21 priority research areas in 1996. On the strength of industry support and bipartisan backing, [[United States Congress|Congress]] increased funding for NIOSH and investment in NORA grew from $15.4 million in 1996 to $72.3 million in 1999.&lt;ref name=ucla/&gt; Following Rosenstock's resignation in 2000, Dr. John Howard continued to press and expand the NORA approach as NIOSH's new director.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, James.

Retrieved on 2008-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodically, the structure of the program is evaluated and updated as needed. Since 1996, NORA's projects have covered topics such as [[slip and fall|slip, trip, and fall]] (STF) injuries; [[Green Tobacco Sickness|green tobacco sickness]]; extended work hours; [[latex allergy|latex allergies]]; vehicle and mobile equipment-related injury; [[silicon dioxide|silica]], [[lung cancer]], and [[respiratory disease]]; and biomechanical stress in drywall installation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/pastnora.html "Celebrating NORA, 1996-2006"], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

== NORA's Research Organization: Sectors and Cross-Sectors ==
Since 2006, the program has been organized by industrial sector as defined in the [[North American Industry Classification System]]. NORA sector councils, which head the research for the sectors, help to implement the national research agenda.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;"About Nora...Partnerships, Research, and Practice." [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/about.html NIOSH Website]. 10-21-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The accomplishments of the second decade of NORA are described in a [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-146/pdfs/2017-146.pdf report] published in 2017. NORA councils consists of participants from various backgrounds, affiliations and expertise, including stakeholders from universities, large and small businesses, professional associations, government agencies, and worker organizations.  Councils present the opportunity to maximize resources towards improved occupational safety and health nationwide. They help build close partnerships among members and broader collaborations between councils and other organizations. The resulting information sharing and leveraging efforts helps promote widespread adoption of improved workplace practices based on research results. The NORA industry sector councils for the 2016-2026 decade are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-118/ "The Nation's Investment in Occupational Safety and Health Research"], DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2007-118.

===NORA priorities===
To aid with goal-setting, NORA uses specific guidelines to determine which research needs are priorities, by using use concepts of burden, need, and impact criteria to write research goals that go into NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Agendas. These guidelines basically address these aspects:&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;
*number of workers at risk for illness or injury
*severity of the hazard/issue
*probability that new information will help abate the hazard

== NORA results ==
Every ten years, NIOSH reviews the activities, outcomes, and impacts of work completed over the past NORA decade and completes a report of those accomplishments. The first decade report evaluated contributions from 1996-2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2006-121/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - NORA: The Team Document (2006-121)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second decade report reviewed activities from 2006-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-146/|title=National Occupational Research Agenda: Second Decade in Review {{!}} 2006–2016|date=2017-07-18|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NORA's third decade will occur from 2016-2026.

== NORA symposiums ==
To ensure a continued focus on the practical application of the research, NIOSH cosponsored NORA Symposiums in 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2008.   The 2008 NORA Symposium—"Public Market for Ideas and Partnerships"—was the first not held in the Washington, D.C., area. Instead it was hosted in [[Denver]], reflecting NIOSH's desire to expand occupational research collaborations in the Western United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ohsonline.com/Articles/2008/07/NORA-Symposium-to-Highlight-Safety-Research-Partnerships.aspx "NORA Symposium to Highlight Safety Research Partnerships"], ''Occupational Health &amp; Safety'' Magazine 2008-07-15.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12375">'''National health insurance''' ('''NHI''') – sometimes called '''statutory health insurance''' ('''SHI''') – is a system of [[health insurance]] that insures a national population against the costs of [[health care]]. It may be administered by the public sector, the private sector, or a combination of both. Funding mechanisms vary with the particular program and country. National or Statutory health insurance does not equate to government-run or government-financed health care, but is usually established by national legislation. In some countries, such as Australia's [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system, the UK's [[National Health Service]], and the South Korea’s [[National Health Insurance Corporation]] contributions to the system are made via general taxation and therefore are not optional even though use of the health system it finances is. In practice, most people paying for NHI will join it. Where the NHI involves a choice of multiple insurance funds, the rates of contributions may vary and the person has to choose which insurance fund to belong to.

==Types of programs==
{{See also|Health care systems|Single-payer health care|Universal health care}}

National healthcare insurance programs differ both in how the money is collected, and in how the services are provided. In countries such as Canada, payment is made by the government directly from tax revenue. The collection is administered by government.  This is known in the [[United States]] as [[single-payer health care]]. The provision of services may be through either publicly or privately owned health care providers. In France a similar system of compulsory contributions is made, but the collection is administered by non-profit organisations set up for the purpose.

An alternative funding approach is where countries implement national health insurance by legislation requiring compulsory contributions to competing insurance funds. These funds (which may be run by public bodies, private for-profit companies, or private non-profit companies), must provide a minimum standard of coverage and are not allowed to discriminate between patients by charging different rates according to age, occupation, or previous health status. To protect the interest of both patients and insurance companies, the government establishes an [[equalization pool]] to spread risks between the various funds. The government may also contribute to the equalization pool as a form of health care subsidy. This is the model used in the Netherlands.

Other countries are largely funded by contributions by employers and employees to sickness funds. With these programs, funds come from neither the government nor direct private payments. This system operates in countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]]. These funds are usually not for profit institutions run solely for the benefit of their members. Usually characterization is a matter of degree: systems are mixes of these three sources of funds (private, employer-employee contributions, and national/sub-national taxes).

In addition to direct medical costs, some national insurance plans also provide compensation for loss of work due to ill-health, or may be part of wider [[social insurance]] plans covering things such as pensions, unemployment, occupational retraining, and financial support for students.

National schemes have the advantage that the pool or pools tend to be very very large and reflective of the national population. Health care costs, which tend to be high at certain stages in life such as during pregnancy and childbirth and especially in the last few years of life can be paid into the pool over a lifetime and be higher when earnings capacity is greatest to meet costs incurred at times when earnings capacity is low or non existent.  This differs from the private insurance schemes that operate in some countries which tend to price insurance year on year according to health risks such as age, family history, previous illnesses, and height/weight ratios. Thus some people tend to have to pay more for their health insurance when they are sick and/or are least able to afford it. These factors are not taken into consideration in NHI schemes. In private schemes in competitive insurance markets, these activities by insurance companies tend to act against the basic principles of insurance which is group solidarity.

'''Occupational burnout''' is thought to result from long-term, unresolvable, job stress. In 1974, [[Herbert Freudenberger]] became the first researcher to publish in a ''psychology''-related journal a paper that used the term ''burnout''. The paper was based on his observations of the volunteer staff (including himself) at a free clinic for drug addicts.&lt;ref name="staffburnout1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freudenberger, H.J.|year=1974|title=Staff burnout|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume= 30|pages=159–165|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1974.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized burnout by a set of symptoms that includes exhaustion resulting from work's excessive demands as well as physical symptoms such as headaches and sleeplessness, "quickness to anger" and closed thinking. He observed that the burned-out worker "looks, acts, and seems depressed". After the publication of Freudenberger's original paper, interest in occupational burnout grew. Because the phrase "burnt-out" was part of the title of a 1961 Graham Greene novel, ''A Burnt-Out Case'', which dealt with a doctor working in the Belgian Congo with patients who had leprosy, the phrase may have been in use outside the psychology literature before Freudenberger employed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Burnt-Out Case|last=Greene|first=Graham|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|year=1961|isbn=978-0140185393|pages=cover title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to study burnout, a number of researchers developed more focused conceptualizations of burnout. In one conceptualization, job-related burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (treating clients/students and colleagues in a cynical way), and reduced feelings of work-related personal accomplishment.&lt;ref name = "Maslach"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maslach, C., Jackson, S.E, &amp; Leiter, M.P. |title=MBI: The Maslach Burnout Inventory: Manual|publisher= Consulting Psychologists Press|location=Palo Alto|year= 1996|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277816643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruotsalainen|first1=JH|last2=Verbeek|first2=JH|last3=Mariné|first3=A|last4=Serra|first4=C|title=Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 April 2015|issue=4|pages=CD002892|pmid=25847433|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another conceptualization, burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Shirom, A., &amp; Melamed, S.|year=2006|title=A comparison of the construct validity of two burnout measures in two groups of professionals|journal=International Journal of Stress Management|volume=13|issue=2|pages=176–200|doi=10.1037/1072-5245.13.2.176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third conceptualization holds that burnout consists of exhaustion and disengagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Vardakou | first3 = I. | last4 = Kantas | first4 = A. | year = 2002 | title = The convergent validity of two burnout instruments: A multitrait-multimethod analysis | url = | journal = European Journal of Psychological Assessment | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 296–307 | doi = 10.1037/a0037726 | pmid = 25151460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the three conceptualizations, as well as Freudenberger's, is exhaustion. Long limited to these dimensions, burnout is now known to involve the full array of depressive symptoms (e.g., low mood, cognitive alterations, sleep disturbance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bianchi, R., Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Laurent, E.|year=2015|title=Burnout-depression overlap: A review|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=36|pages=28–41|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.01.004|pmid=25638755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Schonfeld | first2 = I.

Originally, Maslach and her colleagues focused on burnout within human service professions (e.g., teachers, social workers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = S. | last2 = Schwab | first2 = R. | last3 = Schuler | first3 = R. | year = 1986 | title = Toward an understanding of the burnout phenomenon | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 630–640 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.71.4.630}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later expanded the application of burnout to include individuals in many other occupations.&lt;ref name = "Maslach"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Burnout is not recognized as a distinct disorder in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-5]].&lt;ref name="sciammind2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ulrich Kraft|publisher=Scientific American|title=Burned Out|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/burned-out/|date=June 2006|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the [[ICD-10]], but not as a disorder.&lt;ref&gt;ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in the ICD under problems related to life-management difficulty (Z73).

In 1981, [[Christina Maslach]] and Susan Jackson developed the first widely used instrument for assessing burnout, namely, the [[Maslach Burnout Inventory]] (MBI).&lt;ref name = "Maslach2"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maslach, C., &amp; Jackson, S.E.|year=1981|title=The measurement of experienced burnout|journal=Journal of Occupational Behaviour|volume= 2|issue=2|pages=99–113|doi=10.1002/job.4030020205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with Maslach's conceptualization, the MBI operationalizes burnout as a three-dimensional syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.&lt;ref name = "Maslach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maslach"/&gt; Other researchers have argued that burnout should be limited to fatigue and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kristensen|first1 = T.S.|last2 = Borritz|first2 = M.|last3 = Villadsen|first3 = E.|last4 = Christensen|first4 = K.B.|year = 2005|title = The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory: A new tool for the assessment of burnout|url = |journal = Work &amp; Stress|volume = 19|issue = 3|pages = 192–207|doi = 10.1080/02678370500297720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing body of evidence suggests that burnout is etiologically, clinically, and [[nosology|nosologically]] similar to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, E., Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Laurent, E.

==Risk factors==
Evidence suggests that the etiology of burnout is multifactorial, with dispositional factors playing an important, long-overlooked role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Alarcon|first1 = G.|last2 = Eschleman|first2 = K. J.|last3 = Bowling|first3 = N. A.|year = 2009|title = Relationships between personality variables and burnout: A meta-analysis|url = |journal = Work &amp; Stress|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 244–263|doi = 10.1080/02678370903282600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Swider|first1 = B.

Occupational burnout often develops slowly and may not be recognized until it has become severe. When one's expectations about a job and its reality differ, burnout can begin.

Burnout is thought to occur when a mismatch is present between the nature of the job and the person doing the job. A common indication of this mismatch is work overload, which sometimes involves a worker who survives a round of layoffs, but after the layoffs the worker finds that he or she is doing too much with too few resources. Overload may occur in the context of downsizing, which often does not narrow an organization's goals, but requires fewer employees to meet those goals.&lt;ref name="Maslach972"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Maslach, C. &amp; Leiter, M.P.|title=The Truth About Burnout: How Organizations Cause Personal Stress and What to Do About It|location=New York|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[job demands-resources model]] has implications for burnout, as measured by the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Physical and psychological job demands were concurrently associated with the exhaustion, as measured by the OLBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demerouti|first1=Evangelia|last2=Bakker|first2=Arnold B.|last3=Nachreiner|first3=Friedhelm|last4=Schaufeli|first4=Wilmar B.|title=The job demands-resources model of burnout.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=499–512|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of job resources was associated with the disengagement component of the OLBI.

Maslach, Schaufeli and Leiter identified six risk factors for burnout: mismatch in workload, mismatch in control, lack of appropriate awards, loss of a sense of positive connection with others in the workplace, perceived lack of fairness, and conflict between values.&lt;ref name="Maslach01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Maslach|first1 = C.|last2 = Schaufeli|first2 = W. B.|last3 = Leiter|first3 = M. P.|editor = S. T. Fiske |editor2=D. L. Schacter |editor3=C. Zahn-Waxler|year = 2001|title = Job burnout|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 52|pages = 397–422|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.397|pmid = 11148311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnout is supposed to be a work-specific syndrome. However, this restrictive view of burnout's scope has been shown to be groundless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Truchot | first2 = D. | last3 = Laurent | first3 = E. | last4 = Brisson | first4 = R. | last5 = Schonfeld | first5 = I. S. | year = 2014 | title = Is burnout solely job-related? A critical comment | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 357–361 | doi=10.1111/sjop.12119| pmid = 24749783 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, burnout could apply to nonwork roles such as that of caregiver or student.

==Effects==
Some research indicates that burnout is associated with reduced [[job performance]], coronary [[heart disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Toker, S., Melamed, S., Berliner, S., Zeltser, D., &amp; Shapira, I.|year=2012|title=Burnout and risk of coronary heart disease: a prospective study of 8838 employees|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume= 74|issue=8|pages=840–847|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e31826c3174|pmid=23006431}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mental health]] problems (although note the abovementioned research that suggests it is a depressive syndrome, e.g., Ahola et al., 2005&lt;ref name = "Ahola"/&gt;). Chronic burnout is also associated with cognitive impairments such as [[memory]] and [[attention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Sandstrom|first = A|author2 = Rhodin IN|author3 = Lundberg M|author4 = Olsson T|author5 = Nyberg L.|title = Impaired cognitive performance in patients with chronic burnout sysndrome.|journal = Biological Psychology|year = 2005|volume = 69|issue = 3|pages = 271–279|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051104001553|accessdate = December 5, 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.08.003|pmid = 15925030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational burnout is also associated with absences, time missed from work, and thoughts of quitting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = T. | last2 = Shewchuk | first2 = R. | last3 = Hagglund | first3 = K. | last4 = Rybarczyk | first4 = B. | last5 = Harkins | first5 = S. | year = 1996 | title = Occupational burnout, tolerance for stress, and coping among nurses in rehabilitation units | url = | journal = Rehabilitation Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 267–284 | doi=10.1037/0090-5550.41.4.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==

=== At the individual level ===
It is difficult to treat the three symptoms of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, as they react to the same preventive or treatment activities in different ways.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hätinen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kinnunen | first2 = U. | last3 = Pekkonen | first3 = M. | last4 = Kalimo | first4 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Comparing two burnout interventions: Perceived job control mediates decreases in burnout | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 227–248 | doi=10.1037/1072-5245.14.3.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exhaustion is more easily treated than cynicism and professional inefficacy, which tend to be more resistant to treatment. Research shows that intervention actually may worsen the professional efficacy of one who originally had low professional efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Dierendonck | first1 = D. | last2 = Schaufeli | first2 = W. B. | last3 = Buunk | first3 = B. P. | year = 1998 | title = The evaluation of an individual burnout intervention program: The role of inequity and social support | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 392–407 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.83.3.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of preventing occupational burnout, various stress management interventions have been shown to help improve employee health and well-being in the workplace and lower stress levels. Training employees in ways to manage stress in the workplace have also proven effective in prevention of burnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. McLaurine|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uRU3tG29VfUC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=job%20burnout%20prevention&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= A correlational study of job burnout and organizational commitment among correctional officers|publisher= Capella University. School of Psychology|page= 92|isbn=9780549438144}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggest that social-cognitive processes such as [[organizational commitment|commitment]] to work, [[self-efficacy]], learned resourcefulness and [[hope]] may insulate individuals from experiencing occupational burnout.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Increased [[Job control (workplace)|job control]] is another intervention shown to help counteract exhaustion and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007" /&gt;

Burnout prevention programs have traditionally focused on [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[cognitive restructuring]], didactic [[stress management]], and relaxation. CBT, [[relaxation technique]]s (including physical techniques and mental techniques), and schedule changes are the best-supported techniques for reducing and preventing burnout in a health-care specific setting. Combining both organizational and individual level activities may be the most beneficial approach to reduce symptoms. A Cochrane review reported that evidence for the efficacy of CBT in healthcare workers is of low quality, indicating that it is no better than alternative interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruotsalainen|first1=JH|last2=Verbeek|first2=JH|last3=Mariné|first3=A|last4=Serra|first4=C|title=Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 April 2015|issue=4|pages=CD002892|pmid=25847433|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee rehabilitation is a tertiary preventive intervention which means the strategies used in rehabilitation are meant to alleviate, as well as prevent, burnout symptoms.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007" /&gt; Such rehabilitation of the working population includes multidisciplinary activities with the intent of maintaining and improving employees' working ability and ensuring a supply of skilled and capable labor in society.

Additional prevention methods include: starting the day with a relaxing ritual; adopting healthy eating, exercising, and sleeping habits; setting boundaries; taking breaks from technology; nourishing one's creative side, and learning how to manage stress.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Smith, M., Segal, R., &amp; Segal, J.|year=2014|title=Stress Symptoms, Signs, &amp; Causes: The Effects of Stress Overload and What You Can Do About It|accessdate=31 March 2014|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/stress_signs.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927114835/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/stress_signs.htm|archivedate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the organizational level ===
While individuals can [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with the symptoms of burnout, the only way to truly prevent burnout is through a combination of organizational change and education for the individual.&lt;ref name="Maslach972"/&gt;

Maslach and Leiter postulated that burnout occurs when there is a disconnection between the organization and the individual with regard to what they called the six areas of work life: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values.&lt;ref name="Maslach01"/&gt; Resolving these discrepancies requires integrated action on the part of both the individual and the organization.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on workload means assuring adequate resources to meet demands as well as [[Work–life balance|work/life balances]] that encourage employees to revitalize their energy.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on values means clear organizational values to which employees can feel committed.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on community means supportive leadership and relationships with colleagues rather than discord.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt;

One approach for addressing these discrepancies focuses specifically on the fairness area. In one study employees met weekly to discuss and attempt to resolve perceived inequities in their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = van Dierendonck|first1 = D.|last2 = Schaufeli|first2 = W. B.|last3 = Buunk|first3 = B. P.|year = 1998|title = The evaluation of an individual burnout intervention program: the role of in- equity and social support|url = |journal = J. Appl. Psychol.|volume = 83|issue = 3|pages = 392–407|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.83.3.392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention was associated with decreases in exhaustion over time but not cynicism or inefficacy, suggesting that a broader approach is required.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt;

The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The [[hymen]] is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva maneuve]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r is performed by the woman while in the dorsal lithotomy position.&lt;ref name="medscape"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814321_2?pa=B35LncSjNvX/jiw6dzfOYAIGa/Lq1tRP5XyOfPcs7ZqgM3E57VzsrmFFvo8kusb356MI7dGTgNawPfsOtJla9Q==|title=Urogynecological Risk Assessment in Postmenopausal Women|last1=Sengupta|first1=Niladri|last2=Hilliard|first2=Timothy|date=2013|website=www.medscape.com|accessdate=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harr" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, [[cervix]], hymen, [[Perineum|perineal body]], total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and [[Vaginal fornix|posterior fornix]].&lt;ref name =racgp&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/july/pelvic-organ-prolapse-%E2%80%93-a-review/|title=RACGP – Pelvic organ prolapse – a review|last=Practitioners|first=The Royal Australian College of General|website=www.racgp.org.au|language=English|accessdate=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three by three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers.

This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is currently used widely in China and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yi-ting|last2=Jiang|first2=Jun-ying|last3=Han|first3=Jin-song|date=2016-02-01|title=A review of the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in China|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2830-6|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=287–290|doi=10.1007/s00192-015-2830-6|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other assessments ==
Other assessment tools are also used to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ),The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20.&lt;ref name="medscape" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be:&lt;ref name="harr" /&gt;
* voiding [[cystometry]]
* [[ultrasound]]
* defecating [[proctography]]
* [[anorectal manometry|anal manometry]]
* [[electromyography]]
* [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]

In the US, greater than 200,000 [[surgery|surgeries]] are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are [[cystocele]], [[rectocele]], [[urethrocele]], [[enterocele]] and [[sigmoidocele]]. Cystocele is the most common.&lt;ref name="umek"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern-Elenskaia|first=Ksenia|last2=Umek|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Bodner-Adler|first3=Barbara|last4=Hanzal|first4=Engelbert|date=2017-12-06|title=Anterior colporrhaphy: a standard operation?

Other assessments have been developed. The Porges or Severity prolapse assessment system was proposed in 1963. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5cYRhGJsOsC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=rugae+vaginal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_aB0zfSH_H&amp;sig=4bxHBjHfuWtdR361qDUs0m--GNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAwZmh5KfZAhVNhq0KHf6WCX04ChDoAQhVMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=rugae%20vaginal&amp;f=false|title=Vaginal Surgery for Incontinence and Prolapse|last=Zimmern|first=Philippe E.|last2=Haab|first2=Francois|last3=Chapple|first3=Christopher R.|date=2007-12-09|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781846283468|location=|pages=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[the Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System]] was developed and is the second most used system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="persu" /&gt; In 1980, the Beecham system was developed.

''Gravidus'' and ''gravid'' come from the [[Latin]] for "heavy" and a pregnant female is sometimes referred to as a ''[[Gravidity|gravida]]''.&lt;ref name = 'MFD'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gravida |title=definition of gravida |access-date=17 January 2008 |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gravidity and parity|Gravidity]] is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant.  Similarly, the term ''[[Parity (medicine)|parity]]'' is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a [[fetal viability|viable stage]].&lt;ref name="Patient"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravidity and Parity Definitions (Implications in Risk Assessment)|url=https://patient.info/doctor/gravidity-and-parity-definitions-and-their-implications-in-risk-assessment|website=patient.info|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212152618/http://patient.info/doctor/gravidity-and-parity-definitions-and-their-implications-in-risk-assessment|archive-date=12 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth.  A woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a ''nulligravida.''  A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a ''primigravida'',&lt;ref name=TMHP&gt;{{cite-TMHP|Primipara}}, page 596.&lt;/ref&gt; and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a ''[[multigravida]]'' or as ''multiparous.''&lt;ref name = 'MFD' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of nulligravida|url=http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/nulligravida|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster, Incorporated]]|access-date=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908010608/http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/nulligravida|archive-date=8 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as ''gravida 2, para 1'' and upon live delivery as ''gravida 2, para 2.'' In-progress pregnancies, [[abortion]]s, [[miscarriage]]s and/or [[stillbirth]]s account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a [[multiple birth]] the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as ''nulliparous''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15259 |title=Nulliparous definition |date=18 November 2000 |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709225422/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15259 |archive-date=9 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''preterm'' and ''postterm''  have largely replaced earlier terms of ''premature'' and ''postmature''. ''Preterm'' and ''postterm'' are defined above, whereas ''premature'' and ''postmature'' have historical meaning and relate more to the infant's size and state of development rather than to the stage of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11895 |title=Definition of Premature birth |access-date=16 January 2008 |publisher=Medicine.net |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709225826/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11895 |archive-date=9 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.discovery.com/encyclopedias/illnesses.html?article=2728 |title=Premature Infant |access-date=16 January 2008 |author=Lama Rimawi, MD |date=22 September 2006 |work=Disease &amp; Conditions Encyclopedia |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC. |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119213709/http://health.discovery.com/encyclopedias/illnesses.html?article=2728 |archive-date=19 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melasmablemish.jpg|thumb|[[Melasma]] pigment changes to the face due to pregnancy]]
The usual [[symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy]] do not significantly interfere with [[activities of daily living]] or pose a health-threat to the mother or baby. However, [[Pregnancy#Complications|pregnancy complications]] can cause other more severe symptoms, such as those associated with [[anemia]].

Common symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy include:
*[[Fatigue (medicine)|Tiredness]]
*[[Morning sickness]]
*[[Constipation]]
*[[Pelvic girdle pain]]
*[[Back pain#Pregnancy|Back pain]]
*[[Braxton Hicks contractions]]. Occasional, irregular, and often painless contractions that occur several times per day.
*[[Peripheral edema]] swelling of the lower limbs. Common complaint in advancing pregnancy. Can be caused by [[inferior vena cava syndrome]] resulting from compression of the [[inferior vena cava]] and pelvic veins by the [[uterus]] leading to increased [[Hydrostatic pressure#Medicine|hydrostatic pressure]] in lower extremities.
*[[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]] often caused by compression of both the inferior vena cava and the [[abdominal aorta]] ([[aortocaval compression syndrome]]).
*[[Increased urinary frequency]]. A common complaint, caused by increased intravascular volume, elevated [[glomerular filtration rate]], and compression of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] by the expanding uterus.
*[[Urinary tract infection#Pregnancy|Urinary tract infection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Urinary tract infections during pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_complicated_by_disease/urinary_tract_infections_during_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110140608/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_complicated_by_disease/urinary_tract_infections_during_pregnancy.html|archive-date=10 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Varicose veins]]. Common complaint caused by relaxation of the venous [[smooth muscle]] and increased intravascular pressure.
*[[Hemorrhoids]] (piles). Swollen [[Rectal venous plexus|veins at or inside the anal area]]. Caused by impaired venous return, straining associated with constipation, or increased intra-abdominal pressure in later pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CE-Vazquez&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vazquez JC | title = Constipation, haemorrhoids, and heartburn in pregnancy | journal = BMJ Clinical Evidence | volume = 2010 | pages = 1411 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 21418682 | pmc = 3217736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated by: David C. Dugdale, Susan Storck. Also reviewed by David Zieve.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
The chronology of pregnancy is, unless otherwise specified, generally given as [[gestational age]], where the starting point is the woman's [[last menstrual period]] (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Sometimes, timing may also use the [[fertilization age]] which is the age of the embryo.

===Start of gestational age===
{{Main|Gestational age}}
According to [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the main methods to calculate gestational age are:&lt;ref name=acog2012&gt;[http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/ACOG_Departments/Patient_Safety_and_Quality_Improvement/~/media/Departments/Patient%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20Improvement/201213IssuesandRationale-GestationalAgeTerm.pdf Obstetric Data Definitions Issues and Rationale for Change - Gestational Age &amp; Term] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106111500/http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/ACOG_Departments/Patient_Safety_and_Quality_Improvement/~/media/Departments/Patient%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20Improvement/201213IssuesandRationale-GestationalAgeTerm.pdf |date=6 November 2013 }} from Patient Safety and Quality Improvement at [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]. Created November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the [[Menstrual cycle|last menstrual period]].
*Early [[obstetric ultrasound]], comparing the size of an [[human embryo|embryo]] or [[fetus]] to that of a [[reference group]] of pregnancies of known gestational age (such as calculated from last menstrual periods), and using the mean gestational age of other embryos or fetuses of the same size. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=acog2012/&gt;
*In case of [[in vitro fertilization]], calculating days since [[oocyte retrieval]] or [[co-incubation]] and adding 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tunón K, Eik-Nes SH, Grøttum P, Von Düring V, Kahn JA | title = Gestational age in pregnancies conceived after in vitro fertilization: a comparison between age assessed from oocyte retrieval, crown-rump length and biparietal diameter | journal = Ultrasound in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–6 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10776011 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-0705.2000.00004.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estimation of due date===
[[File:Distribution of gestational age at childbirth.jpg|thumb|Distribution of gestational age at childbirth among singleton live births, given both when [[gestational age]] is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and directly by last menstrual period.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffman CS, Messer LC, Mendola P, Savitz DA, Herring AH, Hartmann KE | title = Comparison of gestational age at birth based on last menstrual period and ultrasound during the first trimester | journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 587–96 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19000297 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00965.x | author5-link = Amy H. Herring }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 80% of births occur between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age.]]
{{Main|Estimated date of confinement}}
Due date estimation basically follows two steps:
*Determination of which time point is to be used as [[Origin (number)|origin]] for [[gestational age]], as described in section above.
*Adding the estimated gestational age at childbirth to the above time point. Childbirth on average occurs at a gestational age of 280 days (40 weeks), which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Healthline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/your-due-date.html|title=Calculating Your Due Date|publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc.|access-date=13 January 2010|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221092403/http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/your-due-date.html|archive-date=21 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternative durations as well as more individualized methods have also been suggested.
''Naegele's rule'' is a standard way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. Alternatively there are [[mobile app]]s, which essentially always give consistent estimations compared to each other and correct for [[leap year]], while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year.&lt;ref name="pmid24036402"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambliss LR, Clark SL | title = Paper gestational age wheels are generally inaccurate | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 210 | issue = 2 | pages = 145.e1-4 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24036402 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2013.09.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, actual childbirth has only a certain probability of occurring within the limits of the estimated due date. A study of singleton live births came to the result that childbirth has a [[standard deviation]] of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008/&gt;

[[File:Pregnancy timeline.png|center|thumb|700px|Timeline of pregnancy by [[gestational age]]]]

===Initiation===
{{See also|Human fertilization}}
[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|Fertilization and implantation in humans]]
Through an interplay of hormones that includes [[follicle stimulating hormone]] that stimulates [[folliculogenesis]] and [[oogenesis]] creates a mature [[egg cell]], the female [[gamete]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilization]] is the event where the egg cell fuses with the male gamete, [[spermatozoon]].  After the point of fertilization, the fused product of the female and male gamete is referred to as a [[zygote]] or fertilized egg. The fusion of male and female gametes usually occurs following the act of [[sexual intercourse]]. [[Pregnancy rate#Pregnancy rate for sexual intercourse|Pregnancy rates for sexual intercourse]] are highest during the [[menstrual cycle]] time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility|last=Weschler|first=Toni| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=0-06-093764-5|edition=Revised|location=New York|pages=242, 374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilization can also occur by [[assisted reproductive technology]] such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[in vitro fertilisation]].

Fertilization (conception) is sometimes used as the initiation of pregnancy, with the derived age being termed [[fertilization age]]. Fertilization usually occurs about two weeks before the ''next'' expected menstrual period.

A third point in time is also considered by some people to be the true beginning of a pregnancy:  This is time of implantation, when the future fetus attaches to the lining of the uterus.  This is about a week to ten days after fertilization.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Developing Person Through the Life Span|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mC_LNMy2rbkC|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2011-02-18|isbn = 9781429232050|first = Kathleen Stassen|last = Berger | name-list-format = vanc |page = 90|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160425172707/https://books.google.com/books?id=mC_LNMy2rbkC|archive-date = 25 April 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, during the time between conception and implantation, the future fetus exists, but the woman is not considered pregnant.

===Development of embryo and fetus===
{{Main|Prenatal development|Human embryogenesis|Fetus}}
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]]]]
The sperm and the egg cell, which has been released from one of the female's two [[ovaries]], unite in one of the two [[fallopian tubes]]. The fertilized egg, known as a [[zygote]], then moves toward the uterus, a journey that can take up to a week to complete. Cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the male and female cells unite. Cell division continues at a rapid rate and the cells then develop into what is known as a [[blastocyst]]. The blastocyst arrives at the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall, a process known as [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

The development of the mass of cells that will become the infant is called [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]] during the first approximately ten weeks of gestation. During this time, cells begin to differentiate into the various body systems. The basic outlines of the organ, body, and nervous systems are established. By the end of the embryonic stage, the beginnings of features such as fingers, eyes, mouth, and ears become visible. Also during this time, there is development of structures important to the support of the embryo, including the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]]. The [[placenta]] connects the developing embryo to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply. The [[umbilical cord]] is the connecting cord from the embryo or fetus to the placenta.

After about ten weeks of gestational age, the embryo becomes known as a [[fetus]]. At the beginning of the fetal stage, the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply.&lt;ref name=sharply&gt;
*[[Lennart Nilsson]], [[A Child Is Born (book)|A Child is Born]] 91 (1990): at eight weeks, "the danger of a miscarriage ... diminishes sharply."

Retrieved 2007-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, a fetus is about 30&amp;nbsp;mm (1.2&amp;nbsp;inches) in length, the heartbeat is seen via ultrasound, and the fetus makes involuntary motions.&lt;ref name="Prechtl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalverboer|first1=Alex Fedde|last2=Gramsbergen|first2=Albertus Arend| name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Brain and Behaviour in Human Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzyPozUyKPkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA416|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-6943-1|pages=1–|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919073812/https://books.google.com/books?id=FzyPozUyKPkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA416|archive-date=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During continued fetal development, the early body systems, and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop. Sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation. The fetus continues to grow in both weight and length, although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy.

Electrical [[brain activity]] is first detected between the fifth and sixth week of gestation.  It is considered primitive neural activity rather than the beginning of conscious thought. Synapses begin forming at 17 weeks, and begin to multiply quickly at week 28 until 3 to 4 months after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Illes|editor-first=Judy| name-list-format = vanc |title=Neuroethics : defining the issues in theory, practice, and policy|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198567219|pages=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7USFu5Z0lQC&amp;pg=PA142|edition=Repr.|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919015206/https://books.google.com/books?id=m7USFu5Z0lQC&amp;pg=PA142|archive-date=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal changes===
{{Main|Maternal physiological changes in pregnancy}}
[[File:Breast changes during pregnancy 1.png|thumb|Breast changes as seen during pregnancy. The areolae are larger and darker.]]
During pregnancy, the woman undergoes many [[physiology|physiological]] changes, which are entirely normal, including [[Parental brain|behavioral]], [[cardiovascular]], [[hematology|hematologic]], [[metabolism|metabolic]], [[renal]], and [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] changes. Increases in blood sugar, breathing, and cardiac output are all required. Levels of progesterone and oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and therefore also the menstrual cycle.

The fetus is genetically different from the woman and can be viewed as an unusually successful [[allograft]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite book |title=Immunology of pregnancy |doi=10.1007/0-387-34944-8 |publisher=Landes Bioscience/Eurekah.com ; Springer Science+Business Media |date=2006-01-01 |location=Georgetown, Tex. : New York |isbn=978-0-387-34944-2 |series=Medical intelligence unit |editor-first=Gil |editor-last=Mor | name-list-format = vanc |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this success is increased [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|immune tolerance]] during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams Z | title = Inducing tolerance to pregnancy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 12 | pages = 1159–61 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22992082 | pmc = 3644969 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcibr1207279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune tolerance is the concept that the body is able to not mount an immune system response against certain triggers.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Pregnancy is typically broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trimester trimester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627130638/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trimester |date=27 June 2012 }}.

&lt;/ref&gt; Each trimester is defined as 14 weeks, for a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, et al., (2010). Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no hard and fast rules, these distinctions are useful in describing the changes that take place over time.

====Second trimester====
[[File:Pregnancy 26 weeks 1.jpg|upright|thumb|By the end of the second trimester, the expanding uterus has created a visible "baby bump". Although the breasts have been developing internally since the beginning of the pregnancy, most of the visible changes appear after this point.]]
Weeks 13 to 28 of the pregnancy are called the second trimester. Most women feel more energized in this period, and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away. The uterus, the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus, can expand up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy.

Although the fetus begins to move during the first trimester, it is not until the second trimester that movement, known as [[quickening]], can be felt. This typically happens in the fourth month, more specifically in the 20th to 21st week, or by the 19th week if the woman has been pregnant before. It is common for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later. During the second trimester, most women begin to wear [[maternity clothes]].

====Third trimester====
[[File:Pregnant woman (third trimester of pregnancy).jpg|thumb|left|Pregnant woman in third trimester of pregnancy (last month)]]
[[Image:Bumm 123 lg.jpg|thumb|left|The [[uterus]] expands making up a larger and larger portion of the woman's abdomen. At left anterior view with months labeled, at right lateral view labeling the last 4 weeks. During the final stages of gestation before childbirth the fetus and uterus will drop to a lower position.]]

Final weight gain takes place, which is the most weight gain throughout the pregnancy. The woman's abdomen will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen would have been upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low. The fetus moves regularly, and is felt by the woman. Fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's [[navel]] will sometimes become convex, "popping" out, due to the expanding [[abdomen]].

[[Head engagement]], where the fetal head descends into [[cephalic presentation]], relieves pressure on the upper abdomen with renewed ease in breathing. It also severely reduces bladder capacity, and increases pressure on the pelvic floor and the rectum.

It is also during the third trimester that maternal activity and sleep positions may affect fetal development due to restricted blood flow. For instance, the enlarged uterus may impede blood flow by compressing the [[vena cava]] when lying flat, which is relieved by lying on the left side.&lt;ref name="pmid21673002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stacey T, Thompson JM, Mitchell EA, Ekeroma AJ, Zuccollo JM, McCowan LM | title = Association between maternal sleep practices and risk of late stillbirth: a case-control study | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3403 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21673002 | pmc = 3114953 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childbirth===
{{Main|Childbirth}}
Childbirth, referred to as labor and delivery in the medical field, is the process whereby an infant is born.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A woman is considered to be in labour when she begins experiencing regular uterine contractions, accompanied by changes of her cervix – primarily effacement and dilation. While childbirth is widely experienced as painful, some women do report painless labours, while others find that concentrating on the birth helps to quicken labour and lessen the sensations. Most births are successful vaginal births, but sometimes complications arise and a woman may undergo a [[cesarean section]].

During the time immediately after birth, both the mother and the baby are hormonally cued to bond, the mother through the release of [[oxytocin]], a hormone also released during [[breastfeeding]].  Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both the mother and baby.  A review done by the [[World Health Organization]] found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother–infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully.  They recommend that [[neonates]] be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html|title=RHL|website=apps.who.int|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227074038/http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html|archive-date=27 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ideal [[childbirth]] labor begins on its own when a woman is "at term".&lt;ref name="ACOGfive-2"/&gt;
Events before completion of 37 weeks are considered preterm.&lt;ref name="preterm definition"/&gt; [[Preterm birth]] is associated with a range of complications and should be avoided if possible.&lt;ref name="SaigalDoyle2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saigal S, Doyle LW | title = An overview of mortality and sequelae of preterm birth from infancy to adulthood | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608 | pages = 261–9 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18207020 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60136-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes if a woman's [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]] or she has [[Uterine contraction|contractions]] before 39 weeks, birth is unavoidable.&lt;ref name="term definition" /&gt; However, spontaneous birth after 37 weeks is considered term and is not associated with the same risks of a pre-term birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |edition = 24th|title = Williams obstetrics|url = http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b2124757~S0|publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|date = 2014-01-01|location = New York|editor-first = F.

===Postnatal period===
{{Main|Postnatal}}
The postnatal period, also referred to as the ''puerperium'', begins immediately after delivery and extends for about six weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this period, the mother's body begins the return to pre-pregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The beginning of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms by the woman herself, or by using [[pregnancy test]]s. However, an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the [[denial of pregnancy]] by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500.&lt;ref name="pmid21725094"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenkins A, Millar S, Robins J | title = Denial of pregnancy: a literature review and discussion of ethical and legal issues | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 104 | issue = 7 | pages = 286–91 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21725094 | pmc = 3128877 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.100376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some non-pregnant women have a very strong belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gabbe2012&gt; --&gt; This condition is known as a [[false pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Gabbe2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabbe|first=Steven| name-list-format = vanc |title=Obstetrics : normal and problem pregnancies|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781437719352|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-3ufSTqeb6cC&amp;pg=PA1184 1184]|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports that in the past, the main concerns of exercise in pregnancy were focused on the fetus and any potential maternal benefit was thought to be offset by potential risks to the fetus. However, they write that more recent information suggests that in the uncomplicated pregnancy, fetal injuries are highly unlikely.&lt;ref name="pmid12547738" /&gt;  They do, however, list several circumstances when a woman should contact her health care provider before continuing with an exercise program: vaginal bleeding, [[dyspnea]] before exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, preterm labor, decreased fetal movement, amniotic fluid leakage, and calf pain or swelling (to rule out [[thrombophlebitis]]).&lt;ref name="pmid12547738" /&gt;

===Sleep===
It has been suggested that [[shift work]] and exposure to bright light at night should be avoided at least during the last trimester of pregnancy to decrease the risk of psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn.&lt;ref name="ReiterTan2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reiter RJ, Tan DX, Korkmaz A, Rosales-Corral SA | title = Melatonin and stable circadian rhythms optimize maternal, placental and fetal physiology | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–307 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24132226 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intercurrent diseases==
{{Main|Intercurrent disease in pregnancy}}
A pregnant woman may have [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy|intercurrent diseases]], defined as disease not directly caused by the pregnancy, but that may become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy.

*[[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy]] deals with the interactions of [[diabetes mellitus]] (not restricted to [[gestational diabetes]]) and pregnancy. Risks for the child include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, [[large for gestational age]] (macrosomia), [[polyhydramnios]] (too much [[amniotic fluid]]), and birth defects.
*[[Thyroid disease in pregnancy]] can, if uncorrected, cause adverse effects on fetal and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect [[Developmental milestone|neurointellectual development]] in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy, which may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen.
* Untreated [[celiac disease]] can cause [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage), [[intrauterine growth restriction]], [[small for gestational age]], [[low birthweight]] and [[preterm birth]]. Often [[Reproductive system disease|reproductive disorders]] are the only manifestation of undiagnosed celiac disease and most cases are not recognized. Complications or failures of pregnancy cannot be explained simply by [[malabsorption]], but by the [[Autoimmmune response|autoimmune response]] elicited by the exposure to [[gluten]], which causes damage to the [[placenta]].

Compared to the rate in countries where abortion is legal, at 69%.&lt;ref name=Bea2018/&gt;

Of pregnancies in 2012, 120 million occurred in Asia, 54 million in Africa, 19 million in Europe, 18 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 7 million in North America, and 1 million in [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name=Sed2014/&gt; Pregnancy rates are 140 per 1000 women of childbearing age in the developing world and 94 per 1000 in the developed world.&lt;ref name=Sed2014/&gt;

The rate of pregnancy, as well as the ages at which it occurs, differ by country and region. It is influenced by a number of factors, such as cultural, social and religious norms; access to contraception; and rates of education. The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) in 2013 was estimated to be highest in [[Niger]] (7.03 children/woman) and lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.79 children/woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028133713/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|archive-date=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the average childbearing age has been rising continuously for some time. In Western, Northern, and Southern Europe, first-time mothers are on average 26 to 29 years old, up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s. In a number of European countries (Spain), the mean age of women at first childbirth has crossed the 30-year threshold.

This process is not restricted to Europe. Asia, Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the developing world like China, Turkey and Iran. In the US, the average age of first childbirth was 25.4 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf National Vital  Statistics Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720102442/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf |date=20 July 2017 }} from [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] National Center for Health Statistics.

In the United States and United Kingdom, 40% of pregnancies are [[Unintended pregnancy|unplanned]], and between a quarter and half of those unplanned pregnancies were [[unwanted pregnancies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40% of pregnancies 'unplanned'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3515400.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=16 March 2004|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730160553/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3515400.stm|archive-date=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon| name-list-format = vanc |title=Unplanned pregnancies in U.S. at 40 percent|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-unplanned-pregnancies-percent.html|newspaper=[[PhysOrg.com]]|date=20 May 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105113426/http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-unplanned-pregnancies-percent.html|archive-date=5 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
&lt;!-- This section has no references because it is mostly based on the German Wikipedia article. Most information here is common sense or should be easy to source. The section is intended to kickstart a more in-depth treatment. --&gt;
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -16- - Visitation.jpg|thumb|[[Giotto di Bondone]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], circa 1305]]

In most cultures, pregnant women have a special status in society and receive particularly gentle care.&lt;ref name=isbn_9780759110441 /&gt; At the same time, they are subject to expectations that may exert great psychological pressure, such as having to produce a son and heir. In many traditional societies, pregnancy must be preceded by marriage, on pain of ostracism of mother and [[Legitimacy (family law)|(illegitimate) child]].

Overall, pregnancy is accompanied by numerous customs that are often subject to ethnological research, often rooted in [[traditional medicine]] or religion. The [[baby shower]] is an example of a modern custom.

Pregnancy is an important topic in [[sociology of the family]]. The prospective child may preliminarily be placed into numerous [[social role]]s. The parents' relationship and the relation between parents and their surroundings are also affected.

A [[belly cast]] may be made during pregnancy as a keepsake.

===Arts===
{{Main|Pregnancy in art}}
Images of pregnant women, especially small [[figurine]]s, were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods, though it is rarely one of the most common types  of image.  These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with [[fertility in art|fertility]].  Identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem, as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned.

Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric [[figurines]] found across much of [[Eurasia]] and collectively known as [[Venus figurines]].  Some of these appear to be pregnant.

Due to the important role of the [[Mother of God]] in [[Christianity]], the Western visual arts have a long tradition of depictions of pregnancy, especially in the biblical scene of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], and devotional images called a ''[[Madonna del Parto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Timothy Verdon | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mary in western art|year=2005|publisher=In Association with Hudson Hills Press|location=New York|isbn=0-9712981-9-X|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=097129819X+pregnancy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unhappy scene usually called ''Diana and Callisto'', showing the moment of discovery of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s forbidden pregnancy, is sometimes painted from the Renaissance onwards.  Gradually, portraits of pregnant women began to appear, with a particular fashion for "pregnancy portraits" in elite portraiture of the years around 1600.

Pregnancy, and especially pregnancy of unmarried women, is also an important motif in literature. Notable examples include Hardy's ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' and Goethe's ''[[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Faust]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Infertility===
{{main|Infertility}}
Modern reproductive medicine offers many forms of [[assisted reproductive technology]] for couples who stay childless against their will, such as [[fertility medication]], [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] and [[surrogacy]].

===Abortion===
{{main|Abortion}}
An abortion is the termination of an embryo or fetus, either naturally or via medical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abortion|title=Abortion - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com|access-date=2015-07-19|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428075715/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abortion|archive-date=28 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When done electively, it is more often done within the first trimester than the second, and rarely in the third.&lt;ref name=sharply /&gt;  Not using contraception, contraceptive failure, poor family planning or rape can lead to [[unintended pregnancy|undesired pregnancies]]. Legality of socially indicated abortions varies widely both internationally and through time. In most countries of Western Europe, abortions during the first trimester were a criminal offense a few decades ago{{when|date=January 2014}} but have since been legalized, sometimes subject to mandatory consultations. In Germany, for example, as of 2009 less than 3% of abortions had a medical indication.

===Legal protection===
Many countries have various legal regulations in place to protect pregnant women and their children. [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000|Maternity Protection Convention]] ensures that pregnant women are exempt from activities such as night shifts or carrying heavy stocks. [[Maternity leave]] typically provides paid leave from work during roughly the last trimester of pregnancy and for some time after birth. Notable extreme cases include Norway (8 months with full pay) and the United States (no paid leave at all except in some states). Moreover, many countries have laws against [[pregnancy discrimination]].

In 2014, the American state of [[Tennessee]] passed a law which allows prosecutors to charge a woman with criminal assault if she uses illegal drugs during her pregnancy and her fetus or newborn is considered harmed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/30/tennessee_just_became_the_first_state_that_will_jail_women_for_their_pregnancy_outcomes/ |title=Tennessee just became the first state that will jail women for their pregnancy outcomes |author=Katie Mcdonough |date=April 30, 2014 |work=Salon |access-date=May 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505061404/http://www.salon.com/2014/04/30/tennessee_just_became_the_first_state_that_will_jail_women_for_their_pregnancy_outcomes/ |archive-date=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, laws make some actions that result in miscarriage or stillbirth crimes.  One such law is the federal [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]].

'''Primary Care Progress (PCP)''' is a national [[non-profit organization]] advocating for and facilitating the revitalization of [[primary care]] in the United States [[health care]] system. It trains and organizes an interprofessional network of care providers and trainees - doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physician assistants and others - and is inspired by what a 2009 report by the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation ([[NEHI]]) described as a crisis in primary care delivery: an increased demand on primary care by older, sicker patients and decreased supply of primary care practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remaking Primary Care: From Crisis to Opportunity|url=http://www.nehi.net/writable/publication_files/file/primary_care_from_crisis_to_opportunity_background_paper.pdf|publisher=Network for Excellence in Health Innovation|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence shows primary care provides better care at lower cost, yet when compared to medical specialty disciplines it is funded less in the United States than any other developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary care providers are generally overworked and underpaid compared to specialists, and many are disillusioned. This has resulted in fewer and fewer students choosing primary care training, and many providers retiring early or switching careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, PCP offers a community for primary care providers, trainees and faculty to connect and support each other. It provides relational [[leadership development]] training and coaching for building health care teams, improving primary care delivery and organizing for change. PCP focuses on students and trainees through its network of over 50 chapters at health professions institutions around the country. Chapters initiatives range from launching student-run free clinics, to changing curriculums, to organizing their local primary care community.

PCP partners with [[Jeffrey Brenner]]’s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] on the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Hotspotting Mini-Grant Project|url=https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/hotspotter/|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative providing teams of health professions students with the knowledge and opportunity to work with high-risk patients to improve their care.

== Media coverage ==
In 2010, PCP president and co-founder Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer discussed on CNN the crisis in primary care and what is being done to address it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress on CNN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXqe6w9r8Ss|publisher=CNN|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP’s role in the creation of [[Harvard Medical School]]’s Center for Primary Care - which included a series of town hall meetings with hundreds of attendees - was described in a ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, PCP was featured in the [[American College of Physicians]]’ IMpact Newsletter as a “new national organization dedicated to engaging local communities to promote primary care, innovate in care delivery and prepare the next generation of leaders in primary care” by “building a grassroots network of advocates who share the vision of a health care system built on a robust foundation of primary care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress Engages Trainees in Transformation of Primary Care|url=https://www.acponline.org/medical_students/impact/archives/2011/02/feature/|publisher=American College of Physicians|date=Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, President Morris-Singer wrote a blog post for KevinMD.com calling for a primary care “workforce surge,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s time for a primary care workforce surge|url=http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/03/time-primary-care-workforce-surge.html|publisher=KevinMD.com|date=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another for the Health Care Blog on revitalizing the primary care training “pipeline” through a multifaceted approach to overcome the financial, academic, cultural and political challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviving the Pipeline: A Call to Action For All|url=http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/08/11/reviving-the-pipeline-a-call-to-action-for-all/|publisher=The Health Care Blog|date=Aug 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured in a ''New York Times'' article on initiatives encouraging students to consider primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luring Students Into Family Medicine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/us/10iht-educlede10.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Sep 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing PCP, in 2013 Dr. Morris-Singer was a panelist for a Congressional briefing on primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why We Need Robust Primary Care in the US, and What Congress Can Do to Help|url=http://www.primarycareprogress.org/connect/events/item/14/161|date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP was also featured in 2013 articles on the primary care crisis by the Associated Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newly insured to deepen primary care doctor gap|url=https://news.yahoo.com/newly-insured-deepen-primary-care-doctor-gap-141711587.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Health Care Journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of primary care: Who will take care of you?|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2013/05/future-of-primary-care-who-will-take-care-of-you/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, MedPage Today published a piece about Primary Care Progress’ [[grassroots]] efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots Group Aims to Renew Primary Care|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/GeneralPrimaryCare/45977|publisher=MedPage Today|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Atlantic’s story “Why I’m Becoming a Primary Care Doctor” included insight from President Morris-Singer on the stigmatization of primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I'm Becoming a Primary-Care Doctor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/why-im-becoming-a-primary-care-doctor/379231/|magazine=The Atlantic|date=Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New England Public Radio highlighted the work of PCP in two 2015 pieces about the future of primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Path To Primary Care: Who Will Be The Next Generation Of Frontline Doctors|url=http://nepr.net/news/2014/12/31/the-path-to-primary-care-who-will-be-the-next-generation-of-frontline-doctors//379231/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising The Stakes For Primary Care: Advocates Try To Make Field More Attractive|url=http://nepr.net/news/2015/01/23/raising-the-stakes-for-primary-care-advocates-try-to-make-field-more-attractive/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Gaia''' is a U.S. [[non-governmental]], [[non-profit]] organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in Ethiopia and other countries in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="ceihd"&gt;[http://ceihd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=50&amp;ItemId=1 "Impact of Improved Stoves and Fuels on IAP"], CEIHD Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages, environmental damage, and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world. Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and [[Madagascar]], and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.

== Current cooking methods in energy poor communities: the problem ==

=== Biomass fuels and associated risks ===
[[File:Indoor Woodfire Stove.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A traditional Nigerian wood-fired stove|A small boy sits by his mother's traditional wood fuel stove. Because of the inefficient heat production of wood-fired stoves such as this one, women cook indoors for hours each day in poorly ventilated dwellings.]]

More than 3 billion people cook with wood fire worldwide. Approximately 60% of African families cook with traditional biomass, a percentage that increases to 90% for Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Smoke and gaseous emissions pour out of burning wood, animal dung, or crop residues, leading to lung disease and respiratory illnesses in women and children. Traditional biomass fuels release emissions that contain pollutants dangerous to health, such as small particles, [[carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[butadiene]], [[formaldehyde]], and carcinogens such as [[benzopyrene]] and [[benzene]]. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that more than 4 million people die each year from household air pollution generated by cooking with solid fuels in poorly ventilated spaces. 500,000 of these deaths are from childhood pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancet.com/themed/global-burden-of-disease|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution is especially deadly for children; it is responsible for nearly 50% of pneumonia deaths in children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indoor air pollution ====
Because of their constant exposure to cook fires, women and children are particularly at risk. [[Indoor air pollution in developing nations|Indoor air pollution]] causes 56% of deaths and 80% of the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] for children under the age of five.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Indoor air pollution also increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and is associated with tuberculosis, [[perinatal mortality]], low birth weight, asthma, [[otitis media]], cancer of the upper airway, and [[cataract]]s. Respiratory disease in children is the leading cause of death for children, though [[malaria]] and diarrheal diseases are better known.&lt;ref name="changemakers"&gt;[http://proxied.changemakers.net/journal/300603/displayhealth.cfm-ID=208 "Removing Smoke from the Kitchen: An Alcohol Fueled Global Clean Cooking Initiative"], Changemakers.net, an initiative of Ashoka. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution also disproportionately effects refugee, poor urban, and HIV/AIDs populations living in crowded and poorly ventilated conditions, and already carrying the burden of disease.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Fuel collection ====
[[File:Woman Carrying Bundle of Wood, Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|alt=Ethiopian woman carrying large bundle of firewood outside of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|In Entoto, on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, thousands of women and girls collect firewood. They carry heavy loads for many miles which they will use or sell as woodfuel. In Ethiopia 90% of energy comes from biomass like wood and charcoal.]]

===== Personal safety =====
Meanwhile, collecting wood involves risk to personal safety. Women and older children usually collect wood, often facing gender-based harassment and disputes with landowners who accuse them of trespassing. Women in Ethiopia's [[UNHCR]] refugee camps say that they fear assault, rape, and violence while searching for wood.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Refugee Commission. [http://womensrefugeecommission.org/search?q=working+women+at+risk "Working Women At Risk: The Links Between Making a Living and Sexual Violence for Refugees in Ethiopia."]. 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Deforestation and desertification =====
Beyond these public health issues, cooking with wood fires is also unsustainable and contributes to rapid deforestation in the developing world.  Where wood is already limited, its collection leads to desertification. In Africa, collection of wood for cooking and charcoal production is the primary reason for the disappearance of the forests.&lt;ref name="poet"&gt;Flannery-Allen, Julie. [http://www.poet.com/vital/2010/2/stoves-that-save.asp "Vital, Ethanol brings an energy revolution to households in the developing world"]. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the burning of hydrocarbon fuels, coal, charcoal, and even dung contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Smoky cooking fires and stoves contribute to the soot that is estimated to cause approximately 16% of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD). [http://www.hedon.info/docs/COP14_IGSD_INECE_BlackCarbonBriefingNote.pdf "Reducing Black Carbon May Be the Fastest Strategy for Slowing Climate Change. IGSD/INECE Climate Briefing Note"]. Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon|Black carbon particles]] in the atmosphere are considered one of the most dangerous pollutants after carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Furthermore, higher rates of deforestation and desertification force women to travel further and further to gather fuelwood, increasing their vulnerability to the dangers of fuelwood collection.

=== Alternatives to biomass fuels ===
The available alternatives to biomass fuels do not offer much improvement. [[Kerosene]] is imported at significant expense, and is burnt with a wick stove that does not combust the fuel efficiently and tips or spills easily. The projected retail cost of ethanol is lower than that of government-subsidized kerosene in Ethiopia today.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene stoves are also prone to flare ups and explosions; accidental kerosene fires cause many injuries and deaths each year.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene releases carcinogenic emissions and is often poorly refined or [[Adulterant|adulterated]] by the time it is acquired for domestic use.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; [[Liquified petroleum gas|Liquified petroleum gas (LPG)]] burns cleanly but is expensive and cannot be produced locally. Charcoal, a processed biomass fuel, burns with less smoke, but emits carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Meanwhile, coal produces all of the dangerous emissions of traditional biomass fuels and depending on its quality, also produces [[sulfur oxides]] and toxic elements such as [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[fluorine]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Niger Delta Gas-Flares.jpg|thumb|alt=Gas flares in the Niger delta.|The Niger delta flares an estimated 17 billion cubic meters of gases—enough fuel to provide the combined annual natural gas consumption of Germany and France (World Bank). The numerous oil spills and the gas flaring (100 sites burning consecutively for 40 years) in much of the delta have taken a toll on the environment. [[Pollution]] has affected the air, water, soils, vegetation and even physical structures (UNDP, Nigeria 2006). If this natural gas were converted to methanol (a simple alcohol), there would be enough alcohol produced to provide cooking fuel for every home in Africa.]]

=== Aid and energy ===
Aid initiatives and emergency response projects rarely provide energy for cooking, focusing instead on food rations and necessary cookware.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Occasionally the UNHCR purchases and provides biomass and transports it to communities where it is desperately needed.  When aid projects do involve stoves, many undertake the dissemination of improved biomass stoves. These burn biomass fuel more efficiently but do not eliminate the household need for biomass nor eliminate indoor air pollution.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== The solution: alcohol fuels and clean cookstoves ==
[[File:USI bioethanol plant.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the USI bioethanol plant in Brazil|In a continuous process, this USI bioethanol plant produces 95°GL ethanol from starch and sucrose at a rate of 10 liters per hour.]]

=== Alcohol fuels ===

Alcohol fuels have a [[Flammability limit|low-flammability limit (LFL)]] that is higher than [[Fossil fuel|hydrocarbon fuels]], which means they do not catch fire easily, even when spilled. They are extinguishable by water and are not prone to explosion like LPG (propane and butane). Alcohol burns cleanly, producing only [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor, and none of the [[soot]] or toxic chemicals produced by solid fuels and kerosene.
Alcohol fuels are clean (with particle emissions far below the WHO levels).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/exposure/en/index.html "Pollution and Exposure Levels." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; When paired with an efficient stove, alcohol fuels can drastically improve indoor air quality, and thus improve respiratory health and quality of life by reducing the global burden of disease."  &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/burden_global/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is beginning to gain wider recognition as a source of fuel.  Because of initiatives like Project Gaia, the UNDP has placed the previously absent ethanol and methanol near the top of its “energy ladder,” a progression of fuels that range from dirty and inefficient (e.g. biomass) to clean and efficient (e.g. biogas, LPG, ethanol, methanol).&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Project Gaia believes in gradual introduction of ethanol-burning appliances into both the private household market and the small or large institutional market, to ensure widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As the alcohol fuel market increases, and acceptance of clean cookstoves grows, Project Gaia sees the potential for the use of other high-performing alcohol appliances that provide lighting, refrigeration and air-tempering, and generation.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Ethanol ====
[[Ethanol]] can be produced locally from byproducts that would otherwise cause environmental damage. It can be produced from [[biomass]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], and even [[landfill gas]]—resources plentiful in many developing countries.  The [[Renewable energy in Africa|use of alcohol fuel for household fuel]], therefore, is efficient resource management—transforming waste products to a highly valuable resource.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  This transformation can lead to a cleaner environment, the forming of new jobs in industry, agriculture, manufacturing, and the service sector, and a decreased need for imported fuels.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;

=== Clean cookstoves ===

==== The CleanCook Stove ====
[[File:Clean Cook with Ethiopian Cookware.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two-burner CleanCook stove with round-based Ethiopian pots.|The two-burner CleanCook is pictured with traditional, round-based, Ethiopian pots. The stove has been tested and modified to meet the needs of the local culture.]]
[[File:CleanCook One-Burner with flame.jpg|thumb|left|alt=CleanCook One-Burner Stove with Flame|The CleanCook one-burner stove. The canister is the same as the two-burner stove, holding 1.2 liters and cooking for 4.5 hours—enough for one day of cooking for a typical family.]]

===== Origins =====
Project Gaia's team currently works with the alcohol-based CleanCook stove, a stable, stainless steel, one or two-burner stove adapted from the Origo stove invented by Bengt Ebbeson in 1979 and manufactured by Swedish company Dometic AB, the leading manufacturer of alcohol stoves and appliances worldwide. The Origo stove, recognized as the best alcohol stove available, is popular in the leisure markets in the U.S. and Europe, commonly for boating and camping use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"&gt;[http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/gaia08 “Clean, safe ethanol stoves for refugee homes”], The Ashden Awards for sustainable energy. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The stove's working life is to projected to be 5–10 years for daily use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia works to adapt the stove to local cooking needs and habits. Some of the adaptations made to the CleanCook include the slight raising and redesign of the pot-stand to allow for larger pots and for more oxygen to reach the flame, and the addition of handles to make transport and refill of the stove easier.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Dometic =====
Dometic seeks to address the developing world market because alcohol fuel technologies are particularly appropriate for it.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  The CleanCook contains a non-pressurized, no-spill fuel tank that can hold [[methanol]] or [[ethanol]]. The CleanCook stove was designed with several specific safety measures.  The CleanCook stove's fuel canister holds an absorbent mineral fiber covered by a protective metal mesh, preventing fuel from spilling from the canister even when the stove is inverted.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The design of this fuel tank eliminates risk of explosion, flare-up, or leakage, and other safety features built into the stove make the CleanCook less likely to cause burns than other cooking methods.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  Meanwhile, the CleanCook is a high-performing stove, equivalent in power (1.5 to 2[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) and temperature to an LPG stove.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Spill Proof Fuel Canisters.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Demonstration of the spill-proof canisters of the CleanCook stove|At the Dom Orione pilot study in rural Brazil, Harry Stokes of the Stokes Consulting Group demonstrates the CleanCook's spill-proof canister to Sanyogita Seksaria of the Shell Foundation as Regina Couto, Director of Projeto Gaia Brasil, looks on.]]

===== Operation of the Stove =====
To operate the stove, its fuel canister must be filled with one liter of ethanol. If pouring the fuel results in drops around the hole, these must be wiped away. The canister must be clipped onto the base of the stove, the regulator opened, and the ethanol vapor lit with a match or lighter.  After cooking, the canister should be left in position to limit further evaporation of remaining ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Emissions vs. performance =====
The US-based [[Aprovecho|Aprovecho Research Center]] has conducted tests comparing the emissions and energy performance of the CleanCook in comparison with conventional LPG and kerosene stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  When compared with kerosene, the CleanCook used less energy, produced lower emissions, and was quicker than to bring water to a boil.  Compared with LPG, the CleanCook produced the same level of particulate emissions, but LPG released lower emissions of CO and was quicker to boil water.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  The [[UNDP]] in Malawi compared the CleanCook with wood and charcoal stoves and found that the CleanCook cut wood stoves’ CO emission in half, particulate emission by 99%, and energy use by 71%. The findings in comparison with charcoal showed similar results, with the energy use decreased by 55% and the emission and particulate reduction even greater than for wood stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

== Local production and sustainability ==
Project Gaia believes that [[sustainable business]] is the best way to accomplish the goal of providing clean and safe cooking technology, and is supported by the [http://www.undp.org/partners/business/gsb/whatcangsbdo.shtml UNDP Growing Sustainable Business (GSB)] in its initiatives to bring the private and public sectors together.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia's business model involves the merging of stove manufacture and sale with fuel production and sale, thereby giving consumers confidence that they will receive fuel after purchasing stoves, and also allowing part of the stoves’ costs to transfer to the fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  This financing mechanism is the model used for mobile phones and airtime – the initial cost of the stove would be cheaper to ensure its affordability, and this discount would be recovered over the course of several years in a very small mark-up in fuel cost.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Another benefit of this system is that it allows for ownership of the right to produce the stove or parts of the stove in Ethiopia.  The CleanCook is currently manufactured in Slovakia, but the possibility of local production in Ethiopia is currently being explored.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Local production is in its early stages in Addis Ababa, with a starting goal of 18,000 stoves to be produced yearly.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia's business goals also include  certification through the [[CDM Gold Standard]] for dissemination of CleanCook stoves and promotion of alcohol fuels.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== Impact through education ==

Education about indoor air pollution is a fundamental element of Project Gaia's mission, which it has pursued by spreading awareness about the impact of IAP through workshops, seminars, media coverage, and engagement with local, state, and federal government, and organizations such as the [[WHO]] in Ethiopia, and the [[FDRE]]’s Ministry of Health.  The danger of IAP and its effects on populations is often neglected, with malaria, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases receiving the majority of attention.

Project Gaia is also working to educate the public about alcohol fuels and their potential for use in the developing world, and specifically, in the context of household energy.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The market for families throughout the developing world that could benefit from the use of alcohol fuels for cooking and household energy is in the range of 600 million.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; As stated by the UNDP World Energy Assessment (2000), supplying modern energy services to the two billion people who still cook with traditional solid fuels and lack access to electricity is one of the most pressing problems facing humanity today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html "World Energy Assessment: Energy and the Challenge of Sustainability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609101755/http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html |date=2007-06-09 }}, UNDP.

==== The Gaia Association ====
The Ethiopian counterpart of Project Gaia, Inc. is the Ethiopian non-governmental organization, the Gaia Association, which is a UNHCR implementing partner. Ethiopia possesses all of the necessary factors for successful technology transfer of alcohol fuel: the quantity of ethanol produced by its sugar industry, the fact that it depends on imported petroleum fuels and biomass, and its need for improved fuels and safer stoves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedon.info/ProjectGaiaEthiopia “Project Gaia Ethiopia”], HEDON Household Energy Network. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ethiopia was producing approximately 8 million liters of ethanol annually.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Molasses and other byproducts of the industry were being dumped in Ethiopia's rivers until about a decade ago when one of Ethiopia's five mills, Finchaa Sugar Company, solved the waste problem by acquiring a distillery and producing ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; Gaia answered an early query that Finchaa Sugar opened, proposing a household energy market for the ethanol, as no gasoline blending or export market was being successfully developed.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Ethiopia's other mills have also become interested in producing ethanol, as a way to balance the fluctuations of sugar pricing.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's government is developing plans to build ethanol-producing distilleries at all sugar mills, creating an ethanol supply that could fuel over 200,000 stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

Gaia is now planning to build its own micro distillery in Ethiopia as a demonstration project for what can be achieved with small and micro scale distillation plants. Gaia is working with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection authority, the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture to build this distillery.  A range of feedstocks are being considered, including more conventional feedstocks such as molasses, and sugar cane or sweet sorghum juice, or unconventional feedstocks such as fruit waste from the markets in Addis Ababa or sugary materials from plants growing wild such as cactus, the bean pods from the mesquite tree (Prosopis), a noxious invasive species in Ethiopia,  or the Giant Milkweed plant (Calotropis procera).  Gaia is hoping to encourage  very small scale distilleries owned by farmer groups or co-ops and small to medium-sized local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.esmap.org/beia/BEIA_call_for_proposals_pilot_projects_English.pdf “African Renewable Energy Access Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa”], Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fuel blending ====
The domestic fuel blending market and the export market for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic companies such as National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the fuel supply system is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes [[adulterated]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote [[phase separation]] and worsened contamination.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As for the export market, Ethiopia's ethanol production is too small to attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's landlocked location also makes export difficult.  The local selling of Finchaa's ethanol, therefore, provides a sustainable opportunity for Ethiopia, with prices that are affordable but also competitive with the potential export market.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Awbarre Deforestation.jpg|thumb|left|View from the road, between Jijiga and the Awbarre camp; the land is desolate as a result of the heavy deforestation, making it difficult to grow crops or collect firewood. Refugees often must resort to digging up roots for fuel.]]

==== Deforestation ====
Ethiopia is energy-poor and 95-98% deforested, although most of its population still depends on biomass fuels.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Before beginning its pilot studies, Gaia found that refugee families use approximately 3.7 tons of fuel wood a year, and spend up to eight hours every two or three days collecting this wood.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

==== Pilot testing and stove placement ====
CleanCook stoves have now been tested in and placed in three UNHCR refugee camps, HIV/AIDS orphanages run by [[Mother Teresa#Missionaries of Charity|Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity]], in a rural village in [[Somali Region|Ethiopia's Somali State]], and in lower and middle-income private homes in Addis Ababa. Pilot studies conducted by the Gaia Association have yielded positive results and acceptance and widespread approval among households both in the refugee camps and in Addis Ababa. Project Gaia is also working to bring stove manufacturing to Addis Ababa by linking the Ethiopian business Makobu Enterprises PLC and Dometic AB, and encouraging government support for the designation of ethanol for household fuel purposes.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Refugee camps in Ethiopia ====

===== Environmental impact =====
Refugee camps in Eastern Ethiopia that house refugees of Somali conflict have placed heavy pressure on the environment and resources of Ethiopia for the past two decades, reaching a combined population of 600,000 refugees in the early 1990s. The UNHCR and its partner NGOs supply these camps with basic needs but have not provided cooking fuel until recently. Fuel wood gathering, the responsibility of refugee women, has resulted in the almost complete deforestation of the regions around the refugee camps, and Ethiopia's government has banned all cutting of live trees around the camps.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The UNHCR must provide alternatives to wood fuel at any new refugee camps.

===== Active projects =====
Project Gaia is currently active in Awbarre refugee camp (formerly known as Teferi Ber) and [[Kebri Beyah|Kebribeyah]] refugee camp, where all of the camp's approximately 1780 families have CleanCook stoves and a daily ration of ethanol, funded cooperatively by the UNHCR and the Gaia Association. The combined population of Kebribeyah and Awbarre camps is approximately 27,000 people, and the UNHCR is planning to re-open at least two more camps to make room for past refugees who have fled to Ethiopia again after returning to Somalia and experiencing worsening conditions since July 2007.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

In 2012, Gaia Association received a grant from the Nordic Climate Fund (NCF) to demonstrate the feasibility of locally produced ethanol for cooking. The grant provided funds to build a community owned and operated ethanol microdistillery. The distillery, which is currently under construction in the Kolfe-Keranio community on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, will be run by a local women's cooperative, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association.

Also in 2012, in an effort to address the environmental and social problems associated with the overreliance on traditional biomass for household cooking, Gaia Association, together with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority, is piloting a project to demonstrate small-scale, community owned and driven ethanol production from sugarcane (in the form of ethanol microdistilleries) in Amhara, Oromya &amp; Gambella regional states. Partial installation of the EMDs has been completed in two of the three regional states.

==== Partnerships ====
Project Gaia works in collaboration with many organizations that help support pilot studies, encourage government involvement, and provide local or regional support. Gaia's lead business partners are members of the [[United Nations Global Compact]], and many members of the Gaia team have joined the Partners for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaonline.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; which developed out of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in Johannesburg with the goal of cleaning up indoor air.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia is also a member of the HEDON Household Energy Network which unites key actors and stakeholders in the movement for a cleaner, more efficient, and affordable household energy sector.

In Ethiopia, Gaia has created partnerships with organizations that serve poor communities and refugee camps.  Gaia's Ethiopia partners include the UNHCR-RLO and the UNDP, the Good Shepherd Sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers’ Association, Finchaa Sugar Company, the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, and the Ogaden Welfare and Development Association. Under its Breathe Easy Program, the Shell Foundation is a technical and a funding partner for Gaia's Ethiopia and Brazil projects. These partners have supported Gaia's pilot studies and helped to strengthen the relationships between Ethiopian businesses and European and American businesses, with the goal of facilitating the sustainable transfer of technology, goods, and services to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
[[File:Lucy with stove in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove|A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove]]

By 2050 Nigeria is expected to outgrow the population of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/10-projections-for-the-global-population-in-2050/|title=10 projections for the global population in 2050|date=3 February 2014|work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cookstoves- and more importantly, cooking fuels- is huge. Spurring both ethanol and methanol production will create local jobs, help give farmers new markets, and be locally sourced.

Nigeria, like Ethiopia has high potential for large-scale ethanol production from starchy cassava and sugarcane molasses.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Nigeria also possesses an excess of natural gas in the form of gas flares; it is responsible for 40% of worldwide flaring. This natural gas can be easily converted to methanol and Nigeria's flared gas alone could fuel CleanCook stoves in every household in West Africa. Nigeria, like other West African countries, is energy poor and depends on fuelwood for cooking.  In Nigeria, Project Gaia depends on the local support of the Centre of Household Energy and Health, based in the Niger Delta. Gaia's main sponsor in Delta State is the U.S. EPA in partnership with the Delta State Government.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Gaia's technical partner for Nigeria, HydroChem, which is part of the Linde Group, is the leading provider of small-scale hydrogen, CO, and CO2 plants. These plants are easily adapted to manufacture methanol, by converting natural gas into liquid form, and thereby creating a fuel that can be used in the household energy market.  In gas or electric form, it is not feasible for the developing world market because of the investment, infrastructure, and maintenance necessary and subsidies that are required to make it affordable.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  HydroChem's plants are ideal for local, small-scale production at low expense in countries like Nigeria, where gas flares could be converted into household fuel.

Currently, Project Gaia is working with local commercial partners to begin a 10,000 stove pilot study.

=== Brazil ===
Project Gaia studied the acceptance of the CleanCook ethanol stove in different urban and rural households in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil between 2006-2007. Because LPG was too costly for low-income families, most households in the study had been using firewood for cooking. In some areas, woodfuel collection is banned. Participating families could get fuel for cooking easily and cheaply at the gas pump. Households found ethanol easy, safe and affordable to use. The ability to buy ethanol in small quantities, rather than being forced to purchase large canisters of LPG, was most beneficial to low-income households.

Brazil's strong social policies have helped to lift families out of poverty and increase access to energy. As Brazil develops, Project Gaia is working to replicate the Brazilian model in other project sites. Project Gaia's work continues in partnership with [http://www.prolenha.org.br/ Prolenha].

=== Madagascar ===

Project Gaia began work in Madagascar beginning in 2008 at the request of the Government of Madagascar. Project Gaia's work is commissioned with the objective of multifaceted contribution to the goals of the Africa Action Plan (AAP) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to the goals of several initiatives related to the development of alternative household energy sources. Gaia's work with household or indoor air pollution will address other MDGs such as the promotion of gender equality, improving maternal health, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) is one initiative that is working to promote alternative sources of energy that will decrease the burden on Madagascar's forests and to reduce child mortality, a large factor of which is the household use of solid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalactionconsulting.org/consulting/capabilities_energy?id=200806 “Assessment of Ethanol as a Household Fuel”], Practical Action Consulting. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Project Gaia's involvement also contributes to goals in several specific sectors including those of the Ministère de l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts et du Tourisme, the Ministère de l’Energie et des Mines, the Ministère de la Santé, du Planning Familial et de la Protection, the Ministère de l’Agriculture, Elevage et la Pêche, and the [http://www.tanymeva.org.mg/ Foundation Tany Meva] - piloting community-based use of ethanol for household cooking.

=== Haiti ===
Project Gaia launched operations in Haiti, in response to the increased need for relief after the [[Hurricane Tomas|2010 hurricane]] and in the hopes of contribution to the “Build Back Better” strategy being developed by Haiti's government and other engaged nations and organizations. That Haiti is more than 98% deforested makes transition away from wood fuels essential, especially since 70% of Haiti's population continues to rely on charcoal and firewood for fuel. Since the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]], Haitian families have been spending at least 40% of their income on charcoal and all fuel prices have surged.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/30042996/PGI-Haiti-Handout-3-10-10 “Project Gaia &amp; Haiti”], Project Gaia, Inc. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Haiti has great potential for local, sustainable production of ethanol because of its past status as a significant sugar cane producer and the capacity for revival of this industry. One million tons of sugar cane is produced annually – a decrease from 3 million in 1987 – and sugar mills and distilleries are already in place.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Ethanol, even before it is produced locally, can still be sold locally for a lower price than Haitian charcoal.

For this project, Gaia is receiving donations of ethanol fuel for CleanCook stoves from the Brazilian government and the Brazilian ethanol industry. Gaia's approach in Haiti involves three phases: 1) small-scale emergency intervention through donation of 500–5000 stoves, and work with local mills and distilleries to scale up domestic production of ethanol 2) larger-scale scale-up of 20,000–50,000 stoves and ethanol to IDP camps and large communities, partnership with other organizations and 3) sustainability work and local development, cooperation with government to encourage the passage of a [[biofuel]]s plan, assessment of the state of local mills and distilleries that are closed, and of the possibility for micro distillery.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt;

Gaia's collaborators for its Haiti Project include the Government of Haiti Ministry of Women's Affairs, Government of Brazil Ministry of External Relations, UNICA, COSAN, Dometic Group, Viva Rio Haiti, Marin Biological Lab (Woods Hole), CODEP, Terra Endeavors, Inc., J&amp;J Import, BDP International, Trees Water People, [[Public-Private Alliance Foundation]] (PPAF).

== Pilot studies and financial sustainability ==
[[File:Low Income Housing, Location of Pilot Stoves.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ethiopian woman involved in PGI's pilot testing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, standing outside of her low income housing complex|During the pilot study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Gaia Association placed two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. 150 of the stoves were tested in very low-income homes like that of Senedu, pictured above, a resident of a low-income condominium in Addis Ababa. One goal of the study was to find a price for ethanol that would be affordable for the average household, but also partially subsidize the fuel for use in poorer households.]]
Gaia Association conducted thorough pilot studies on the use of different household fuels in Addis Ababa, their varying prices, and the rates of their consumption.  In 2004, Gaia began testing two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. Before and after the 850 stoves were placed, Gaia's field staff conducted household energy audits, consumer satisfaction studies and fuel price elasticity studies. In 50 homes, Gaia monitored IAP, recording levels of CO and particulate matter.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Approximately 150 of the stoves that were tested in Addis Ababa were placed in very low-income homes. This part of the study helped Gaia determine the ideal price level for ethanol so that it would be affordable to the average household and also reach the poorer households.

=== Pilot studies and business model ===
Throughout the process of pilot studies in each of its project sites, Gaia's team documented progress and compiled reports that charted the study results.  Project Gaia used the study results to develop its business plan and to answer questions such as: Who is interested in the stove? Who can produce it? How should it be adapted to better suit its use? Who can distribute it? Who can supply the fuel? How will stove and fuel be linked?&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

=== Simulation of future market conditions and local purchasing power ===
To simulate reality and ensure affordability of the stove, Gaia charged for ethanol during the Pilot studies.  After a month of free fuel, during which families could get used to cooking with the stove, each household paid for its fuel, allowing fuel use and rationing to be accurately documented. After the first month of purchasing fuel, its price was increased to reflect the cost of ethanol once the local market is fully developed. Price Elasticity studies documented the impact of the price increase on the family and their capacity and willingness to pay. Pilot study data showed that these households demonstrated the necessary purchasing power to afford CleanCook stoves and their fuel, if the purchasing price of the stove was subsidized.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Even the poorest urban communities pay for cooking fuels because they cannot gather their fuel, as many refugees do in rural areas of Ethiopia. Wood and charcoal prices have risen because of the need to travel further and further outside of the city to gather them.  Poor families are often forced to pay more for fuel because they buy small quantities of low-quality fuel when they can afford to – sometimes before each meal. Even the lowest grade of fuel is often expensive when purchased this way.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:FWFCA financial security.jpg|thumb|alt=An Ethiopian woman, a member of FWFCA, working at a loom|The Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association (FWFCA) offers women an alternative to carrying fuelwood into Ethiopian cities. It was one of several instances in which, once relieved of firewood collection duties, women are able to work towards financial security. Instead of gathering firewood, women receive training on weaving and together produce scarves and other fabrics using looms. This offers women an alternative source of income.]]

=== Government subsidization of petroleum-based fuels and long-term financial impact ===
Domestically produced ethanol would not require as much subsidization as petroleum-based fuels like kerosene because it can be sold for a lower price. Its domestic production, meanwhile, benefits the economy, and the subsidy that is contributed for its purchase does not leave the country as it does for imported fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

In the context of the refugee camps, ethanol was not sold because of the lack of purchasing power among refugees. When fuel gathering exhausts the little remaining biomass, energy provisions will have to be donor-supplied. Providing stoves and improved fuel, however, can save long-term costs by increasing productivity and well-being among refugees, increasing industry, and reducing health care costs.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Response to the stoves was very positive, both in households where families had experience with modern stoves and improved fuels, and in households without previous experience.  The dominant response included appreciation for the cleanliness and safety of the stove and fuel and a positive evaluation of the stove's power and efficiency. In the refugee camps, CleanCook stoves allowed more women to cook inside their homes, and diminished the need for fuel wood gathering and allowed women more time to pursue income-generating activities, take care of personal health, provide childcare, and seek education. A reduced amount of fuel wood gathering also eased tensions between refugees and local landowners who do not welcome the gathering of wood from their land.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt;

Many groups supported Gaia in its pilot studies, including the UNHCR management and logistical staff for the refugee camps, by the Refugee Care Netherlands (ZOA) staff and FDRE Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA) staff, field survey staff from the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, an Ethiopian government agency under the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the UNDP Growing Sustainable Businesses Program, Winrock International's Clean Energy Group, Makobu Enterprises management personnel, Dometic AB representatives from Research &amp; Development, the Stove Division and Marketing, the Stokes Consulting Group, UNDP-GSB consultants, Finchaa Sugar, consultants from the Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development at the University of California at Berkeley, and Shell Foundation advisors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14043">'''Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score''' ('''PDCAAS''') is a method of evaluating the [[protein quality|quality of a protein]] based on both the [[amino acid]] requirements of humans and their ability to digest it.

The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the [[US FDA]] and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] quality.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Methodology==
Using the PDCAAS method, the protein quality rankings are determined by comparing the amino acid profile of the specific food protein against a standard amino acid profile with the highest possible score being a 1.0. This score means, after [[digestion]] of the protein, it provides per unit of protein 100% or more of the [[Essential amino acid|indispensable amino acids]] required.

The formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is: (mg of [[limiting amino acid]] in 1 g of test protein / mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein) x fecal true digestibility percentage.&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt;

The PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the [[Protein efficiency ratio|protein efficiency ratio (PER)]] and the [[biological value]] (BV) methods.&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jay R.|last2=Falvo|first2=Michael J.|year=2004|title=Protein – Which is Best|url=http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=118–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably differ from those of humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Srikantia, S. G., University of Mysore, Mysore:  "The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements", ''Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements EPR 81 29'', Rome, Aug 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993: 1) PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements, which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals. 2) The Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes.

==Limitations==
===Digestion===
Amino acids that move beyond the terminal [[ileum]] in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in [[protein synthesis]]. They may pass out of the body, or may be absorbed by [[bacteria]], thus will not be present in the feces, and will appear to have been digested. The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested.

Similarly, amino acids that are lost due to [[antinutritional factor]]s present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS.

Due to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/food-technology/daily-news/2013/march/07/fao-proposes-new-protein-quality-measurement.aspx FAO proposes new protein quality measurement. March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on single proteins===
The PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete, since human diets, except in times of [[famine]], almost never contain only one kind of [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. However, calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible, because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing, in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents. To arrive at the final result, all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account, though, so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless.

For example, grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 0.4 to 0.5, limited by [[lysine]]. On the other hand, it contains more than enough [[methionine]]. [[Bean|White bean]] protein (and that of many other [[pulses]]) has a PDCAAS of 0.6 to 0.7, limited by methionine, and contains more than enough lysine. When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet, the PDCAAS of the [[protein combining|combined constituent]] is 1.0, because each constituent's protein is complemented by the other.

A more extreme example would be the combination of [[gelatine]] (which contains virtually no [[tryptophan]] and thus has a PDCAAS of 0) with isolated tryptophan (which, lacking all other essential amino acids, also has a PDCAAS of 0). Despite individual scores of 0, the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS, with the limiting amino acids [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]]. Further, according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma, "The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal&lt;!-- not an error, adj of ileum --&gt; digestibility correction, as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets."&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt; Also, the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS (the validity of the preschool-age child amino acid scoring pattern, the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Impact of amino acid availability on the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score|journal=Bulletin|publisher=International Dairy Federation|volume=336|pages=46–50|issn=0259-8434|vauthors=Darragh AJ, Schaafsma G, Moughan PJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Dairy Foundation on Nutrition and Health Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nutritional Aspects of Milk Proteins in Comparison with Other Proteins, organized by the Dutch Foundation on Nutrition and Health, Utrecht, the Netherlands, March 13–14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capped score===
In addition, the fact that four proteins, all with different amino acid profiles, receive identical scores of 1.0 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool. Since they have different compositions, it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores. In short, this method, however, gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other, because after they pass a certain point, they are all capped at 1.0 and receive an identical rating.&lt;ref name="Best" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarwar G|date=May 1997|title=The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method overestimates quality of proteins containing antinutritional factors and of poorly digestible proteins supplemented with limiting amino acids in rats|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9164998|journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=127|issue=5|pages=758–64 |pmid=9164998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schaafsma G|year=2005 |title=The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)--a concept for describing protein quality in foods and food ingredients: a critical review|journal=Journal of AOAC International |volume=88|issue=3|pages=988–94|pmid=16001875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in 1990 at a FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or "leveled down" to 1.0 as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.&lt;ref name="FAOWHO1990"&gt;FAO/WHO [1990].

[[File:Salk headlines.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headlines from around the world about [[polio vaccine]] tests (13 April 1955)]]

'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human [[health]] through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory]]|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |pages=183–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing the health of a population and the threats is the basis for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "public" in question can be as small as a handful of people, an entire village or it can be as large as several continents, in the case of a [[pandemic]]. "Health" takes into account physical, mental and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Public health is [[interdisciplinary]]. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]] are all relevant. [[Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]] and [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], gender issues in health, sexual and reproductive health are other important subfields.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting [[hand washing|handwashing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]] and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[medical assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists and data managers.]]  Depending on the need [[environmental health officer]]s or [[public health inspector]]s, [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], and even [[veterinarian]]s, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists might be called on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery &amp; Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health &amp; Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example, in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When foreign aid is funnelled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Uy Hoang, Stella B, May CI van S|title=What’s in the ‘Public Health Toolbox’|journal=JOJ Pub Health|year=2018|volume=3|issue=2|page=555607|url=https://juniperpublishers.com/jojph/pdf/JOJPH.MS.ID.555607.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger. "Motivational mismatch: evolved motives as the source of—and solution to—global public health problems". In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for [[health care]] services, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solorzana, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.  Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics.  Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A.

The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|issn=0094-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives - around two-thirds - were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community).  Only about one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

=== Public Health 2.0 ===
''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and [[health blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=13 June 2011 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=DMKD&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Yom-Tov |first2=Elad |last3=Pebody |first3=Richard| last4=Cox |first4=Ingemar J. |date=2 July 2015 |title=Assessing the impact of a health intervention via user-generated Internet content |journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | doi=10.1007/s10618-015-0427-9 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the collection and sharing of information about [[environmental radiation]] levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 13 June 2011 |author = D. Parvaz |date=26 April 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from [[Web 2.0]], such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[information sharing]], and [[user-centred design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hardey, Michael |date=July 2008 | title = Public health and Web 2.0 | journal = Perspectives in Public Health | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 181–189 | doi=10.1177/1466424008092228}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to "Public Health 2.0" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Developing countries==
[[File:MRT Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Emergency Response Team in [[Burma]] after [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008]]
There is a great disparity in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers,]] monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=D T|last2=Mosley|first2=W H|date=January 1991|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries: health policy responses to epidemiological change.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.2105/ajph.81.1.15|pmid=1983911|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1404931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases.  In addition to this however, many [[developing countries]] are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases with, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"/&gt; Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty.  The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Each day brings new front-page headlines about public health: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health effects of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20policy%20interventions%20-%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;f=false|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor=Richard G. Wilkinson |editor2=Michael G. Marmot |publisher=WHO |year=2003 |oclc=54966941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
{{Main|Aid}}Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jay|year=2014|title=The Relationship of Health Aid to Population Health Improvements |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=6|pages=881–887|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.292 |pmc=4777302|pmid=24756557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twumasi|first=Patrick|date=1 April 1981|title=Colonialism and international health: A study in social change in Ghana|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160798781900375|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Proponents of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, a 2014-2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Sustainable development goals ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 - United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1-6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries.&lt;ref name=UN2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals - United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|global public health]]: [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and women's empowerment, and water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN2015/&gt; Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to better public health outcome. 
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrhoel diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015/&gt;

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|last=|first=|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]]  (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition and [[environmental and occupational health]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. (1999). ''Achievements in Public Health, 1900–1999'' - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health Agency of Canada. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php-psp/mphpg-mhplg/mphp-mhpp04-eng.php Canadian Public Health Workforce Core Competencies], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]], among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of public health: a US perspective===
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=William H.|last2=Rose|first2=Wickliffe|year=1915|title=Institute of Hygiene: Being a report by Dr. William H.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182530966|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933-2013,|first=Burrow, Gerard N.,|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHP/&gt;

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911051643/http://www.asph.org/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltaomega.org/ Delta Omega website] (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The primitive nature of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] medicine rendered Europe helpless to the onslaught of the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century. Miniature from "The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis" (1272-1352). Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]]
Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. [[leadership|Leaders]] were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability, [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medical doctors]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion.

In 1485 the [[Republic of Venice]] established a permanent [[Venetian Magistrate for Health]] comprising supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad. The three supervisors were initially appointed by the Venetian Senate. In 1537 it was assumed by the Grand Council, and in 1556 added two judges, with the task of control, on behalf of the Republic, the efforts of the supervisors.

However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").

===Modern public health===
The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/History-Britains-Hospitals-Barry-Carruthers/dp/1857769058/ Carruthers, G. Barry. ''History of Britain's Hospitals'' (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482384/public-health/35547/National-developments-in-the-18th-and-19th-centuries|title=public health|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|1802 caricature of [[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Vale, Brian. "The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: A Challenge to Current Orthodoxy". ''[[The Mariners' Mirror]]'', volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]] published ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the [[military]] [[barracks]] and the provision of [[latrine]]s for the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | pmid=5330009 | last=Selwyn | first=S | publication-date=July 1966| year=1966 | title=Sir John Pringle: hospital reformer, moral philosopher and pioneer of antiseptics | volume=10 | issue=3 | periodical=Medical History | pages=266–74 | pmc=1033606 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300011133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda J. Thomas|title=The Lambeth cholera outbreak of 1848-1849: the setting, causes, course and aftermath of an epidemic in London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGLd5hQ1-8UC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=5 April 2012|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3989-8|pages=55–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith advised the government on the importance of [[quarantine]] and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Stacey|title=The Sociology of Health and Healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IAUjCaEtCoC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-0-203-38004-8|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Samuel Edward Finer]]|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Methuen|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5|pages=424–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871-1948 : a Medical Conundrum|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epidemiology====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s dot map, showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854.]]
The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter,  ''et al.'' (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898.]]
With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital - A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]].

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&amp;site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country examples ===
====France====
[[French Third Republic|France 1871-1914]]  followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252-75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888-1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890-1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902."

====United States====

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Visiting_Nurse_Service_of_New_York_Logo.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]], founded by nursing pioneer [[Lillian Wald]] in 1893]] --&gt;
In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The federal Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) operated a large-scale field nursing program. Field nurses targeted native women for health education, emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hancock Christin L | year = 2001 | title = Healthy Vocatoons:  Field Nursing and the Religious Overtones of Public Health | url = | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 113–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====

[[File:IMSS.jpg|thumb|right|Logo for the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]], a governmental agency dealing with public health.]]
Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761-1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, Mexico was in the process of modernization, and public health issues were again tackled from a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga and Claudia Agostoni, "Science and Public Health in the Century of Revolution," in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H. Beezley, ed. Blackwell Publishing 2011, pp. 561-574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Agostoni, ''Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876-1910''.

Winter 2002, pp. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ana María Carrillo, "Economía, Política, y Saludo Pública en el México Porfiriana, 1876-1910", ''Historia, Ciencias, Saúde - Maginguinhos'' 9, suplemento 2002, pp. 67-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patience A. Schell. "Nationalizing children through schools and hypgiene: Porfirian and Revolutionary Mexico City".  ''The Americas'' 60:4, April 2004, pp. 559-587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Rose Alexander, ''City on Fire: Technology, Social Change, and the Hazards of Progress in Mexico City, 1860-1910''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), public health was an important concern, with a text on hygiene published in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto J. Pani, ''La higiene en México''. Mexico: Imprenta de J. Ballescá 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mexican Revolution, feminist and trained nurse [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] founded the [[Neutral White Cross]], treating wounded soldiers no matter for what faction they fought.

In the post-revolutionary period after 1920, improved public health was a revolutionary goal of the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Elaine Bliss, "The Science of Redemption: Syphilis, Sexual Promiscuity, and Reformism in Revolutionary Mexico City" ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 79:1 1999, pp. 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Aréchiga Córdoba, "Educación, propaganda o 'Dictadura sanitaria'. Estrategias discursivas de higiene y salubridad pública en el México posrevolucionario, 1917-1934". Dynamis 25, 2005, pp. 117-143.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mexican state promoted the health of the Mexican population, with most resources going to cities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Mazzaferri, "Public Health and Social Revolution in Mexico." PhD dissertation, Kent State University 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sowell, ''Medicine on the Periphery: Public Health in Yucatán, 1870-1960''. Lanham: Lexington Books 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern about disease conditions and social impediments to the improvement of Mexicans' health were important in the formation of the [[Eugenics in Mexico|Mexican Society for Eugenics]]. The movement flourished from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Minna Stern, "Responsible Mother and Normal Children: Eugenics, Nationalism, and Welfare in Post-revolutionary Mexico, 1920-1940." ''Journal of Historical Sociology'' vol. 12, no. 4, December 1999, pp. 369-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico was not alone in Latin America or the world in promoting [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Leys Stepan, ''The Hour of Eugenics: Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Government campaigns against disease and alcoholism were also seen as promoting public health.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Pierce, "Fighting Bacteria, the Bible, and the Bottle: Projects to Create New Men, Women, and Children, 1910-1940" in ''Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H. Beezley, ed. Wiley-Blackwell Publishers, pp. 505-517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Mitchell, ''Intoxicated Identities: Alcohol's Power in Mexican History and Culture''. Routledge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] was established in 1943, during the administration of President [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] to deal with public health, pensions, and social security.

====Cuba====
{{see also|Timeline of healthcare in Cuba}}
Since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] the [[Cuban government]] has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of [[Healthcare in Cuba|health conditions]] for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Pineo, “Public Health”, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuban medical internationalism]] as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially [[Mission Barrio Adentro|Venezuela]], as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

====Colombia and Bolivia====
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state.  In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Hanni Jalil, "Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930-1940." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Pacino, "Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952-1964." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ghana ====
Though curable and preventative, malaria remains a huge public health problem and is the third leading cause of death in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/ghana/|title=CDC Global Health - Ghana|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a vaccine, mosquito control, or access to anti-malaria medication, public health methods become the main strategy for reducing the prevalence and severity of malaria.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agyepong|first=Irene Akua|last2=Manderson|first2=Lenore|date=1999/01|title=MOSQUITO AVOIDANCE AND BED NET USE IN THE GREATER ACCRA REGION, GHANA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/mosquito-avoidance-and-bed-net-use-in-the-greater-accra-region-ghana/BAFF83CEC86B78FFF4E942CCC6A4ED8F|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–92|issn=1469-7599|pmid=10081239}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods include reducing breeding sites, screening doors and windows, insecticide sprays, prompt treatment following infection, and usage of insecticide treated mosquito nets.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Distribution and sale of insecticide-treated mosquito nets is a common, cost-effective anti-malaria public health intervention; however, barriers to use exist including cost, hosehold and family organization, access to resources, and social and behavioral determinants which have not only been shown to affect malaria prevalence rates but also mosquito net use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr307/fr307.pdf|title=Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

After irrigation projects diverted water from the [[Aral Sea]] it began to dry up and left behind salts, other minerals and toxins in the soil.  These not only contaminated the soil but also were picked up by winds and storms, and traveled to other areas, including over crop lands.  This has led to increased health problems like respiratory diseases and cancers, among others.  The change in the size of the Aral has also affected the local climate and resulted in increased occurrence and worsening of storms.&lt;ref name=micklin &gt;Micklin, P. P. (1988).  Disiccation of the Aral Sea: A Water Management Disaster in the Soviet Union.  Science.  241(4870), 1172 &amp; 1175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
There is no doubt that the shrinking of the Aral Sea has resulted in health problems for the local community.  However, there is debate as to what extent of these problems can be sourced to this environmental situation. The full effects could take a generation to fully materialize and patterns of health problems to show up. 
Some of the main reasons why the Aral sea area suffered greatly were from "over irrigation and water mismanagement."  Environmental impacts resulting from the changes in the Aral Sea region that could affect human health are "the [[Salinity|salinization]] of the water table, [[pesticide]]s in the environment and [[food chain]], dust storms and air quality."&lt;ref name=small&gt;Small, I., Van Der Meer, J., &amp; Upshur, R. E. G. (2001).  Acting on an Environmental Health Disaster: The Case of the Aral Sea.  Environmental Health Perspectives.  109(6), 547 &amp; 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Uzbek region years of monoculture agriculture of cotton fields left soils depleted of naturally occurring minerals and nutrients.  This eventually led to an increased use of pesticides and fertilizers to try and counter these new soil deficiencies.  However, these increased chemicals found their way into the soils, water, and finally the Aral sea.&lt;ref name=precoda &gt;Precoda, N. (1991). Requiem for the Aral Sea.  Ambio.  20(3/4), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of agricultural activities have also "resulted in widespread soil erosion, chemical pollution, and poor water quality and quantity." &lt;ref&gt;Franz, J. S. &amp; FitzRoy, F. (2006). Child Mortality and Environment in Developing Countries. Population and Environment. 27(3), 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on Infant Mortality Rates==
As the sea dries up the contaminants become exposed on the surface and enter into the soil while also being blown into the air.  These environmental impacts have had wide-ranging effects on health of local residents.  Increases in the occurrence of many diseases and conditions have been noted and linked to the shrinking of the Aral.  Facing the highest risk from exposure to contaminants and toxins are infants and children.  This has contributed to an increasing infant mortality rate in the area.  According to Newbold the infant mortality rate is defined as "the number of deaths of infants younger than one year of age per one thousand births." &lt;ref&gt;Newbold, K.B. (2007). Six Billion Plus: World Population in the Twenty-First Century. 2nd Edition. Lanham:  Rowman &amp; Littlefield.  2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant mortality rates have been increasing in this region since the 1970s, while elsewhere in the world they have generally been going down.&lt;ref&gt;Zhiming, B. , Norio, I., Yoshiaki, K., Ariyoshi, K.,  Kunio, M., Tomokazu, O. &amp; Otsuka Kenji. (2006). Inner Asia: Balancing the Environment with Socioeconomic Development.  The State of the Environment in Asia 2005/2006. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  For residents of the Aral sea region living there has led to high "exposure to industrial pollutants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) [[organic compound|compound]]s and heavy metals but also to pesticides."&lt;ref name=kiess562 &gt;Kiessling, K. L. (1998).  Conference on the Aral Sea: Women, Children, Health and Environment.  Ambio.  27(7). 562.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon leading to increased infant mortality rates has been reported as high as 70 in Kazakhstan as of 1993.&lt;ref name=kiess562 /&gt;  Toxins can come from all sources including breathing them in from the air, drinking water, and food.  However, a young baby does not have much choice about what to eat or drink.  It has been found that these contaminants can be passed down through breast feeding and "in a number of areas the physicians recommend against breast feeding babies, as the nursing mothers milk is toxic." &lt;ref name=precoda /&gt;

As seen in Table 1, other surrounding countries and areas have also experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.  Although there are many other factors that contribute to infant mortality rates, the environmental state in the area has a definite influence on increasing rates.  When compared with developed countries these rates can illustrate differences in health care and access to health care between the areas.

==List of Adverse Health Effects==
In [[Turkmenistan]] alone, 50% of all reported illnesses in children are related to respiratory system difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggs, G.F.S., O'Hara, S. L., Wegerdt, J., Van Der Meer, J., Small, I., &amp; Hubbard, R.  (2003). The Dynamics and Characteristics of Aeolian Dust in Dryland Central Asia: Possible Impacts on Human Exposure and Respiratory Health in the Aral Sea Basin. The Geographical Journal.  169(2), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of this situation are far reaching and affect people in a wide range of ailments.  Following is a list of health problems contributing to high infant mortality, death, and lower standard of living in the Aral Sea area:

* [[diarrhea]]l diseases
* [[vaccine]] preventable diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]
* [[Malnutrition|nutritional deficiencies]]
* [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s&lt;ref name=kiess562 /&gt;
* [[teratogenesis]]
* [[endocrine]] disruption
* neurodevelopmental effects
* behavioral effects&lt;ref name=small /&gt;
* [[gastro-enteritis]]&lt;ref name=precoda /&gt;
* [[typhoid fever]]
* [[hepatitis]]
* [[esophageal cancer]]
* various other cancers
* [[hypertension]]
* [[heart disease]]
* [[anemia]]
* kidney disease&lt;ref name=small /&gt;
* eye disease

==Solutions==
A large concern of remediation of the area is the reduction of the blowing salt and minerals from the exposed  sea bed.  Some solutions include constructing dikes to control water flows and restricting the water amounts diverted for irrigation.  However, the health effects have already been felt and will continue to be present for a long time even if the situation is turned around in the very near future.&lt;ref name=micklin /&gt;

The first natural sensation of quickening may feel like a light tapping, or the fluttering of a butterfly.  These sensations eventually become stronger and more regular as the pregnancy progresses.  Sometimes, the first movements are mis-attributed to gas or hunger pangs.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, Roger. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060746378&amp;id=s-7d20ulE8UC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;ots=cLn4PQ44f0&amp;dq=%22Mayo+Clinic%22+and+quickening&amp;sig=KJyaqcmu-BeNXCMHhrdzIGkwzWc Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy]'', page 480 (HarperCollins 2004).

A woman's [[uterus|uterine]] muscles, rather than her [[abdomen|abdominal]] muscles, are first to sense fetal motion.  Therefore, a woman's body weight usually does not have a substantial effect on when movements are initially perceived.  Women who have already given birth have more relaxed uterine muscles that are consequently more sensitive to fetal motion, and for them fetal motion can sometimes be felt as early as 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Ziel, Cornelia &amp; Tourville, Jacqueline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1569243190&amp;id=jciZAfJWoqsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA70&amp;lpg=RA1-PA70&amp;ots=RD_hiLptXz&amp;dq=quickening+and+%22plus-size%22&amp;sig=S9lPp8zEcLGW3cyEnCouefDFZxI Big, Beautiful &amp; Pregnant: Expert Advice And Comforting Wisdom for the Expecting Plus-size Woman]'' (Marlowe 2006). Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, quickening occurs naturally at about the middle of a pregnancy. A woman pregnant for the first time (i.e., a [[Glossary of terms associated with gravidity|primigravida]] woman) typically feels fetal movements at about 18–20 weeks, whereas a woman who has been pregnant more than once (i.e., a multipara woman) will typically feel movements around 15–17 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Malcolm et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0632051639&amp;id=FHXtDkLzOHEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA8&amp;lpg=RA2-PA8&amp;ots=fkQG1qvn5i&amp;dq=%22quickening%22+and+obese&amp;num=100&amp;sig=-Xgmp3WR71poUh1qJ3oke-5XTOM#PRA2-PA8,M1 Essentials of Neonatal Medicine]'' (Blackwell 2000), page 8.

==Legal history==
{{see also|History of abortion law debate}}

The word "quick" [[wiktionary:quick#Adjective|originally meant]] "alive".  Historically, quickening has sometimes been considered to be the beginning of the possession of "individual life" by the fetus.  British legal scholar [[William Blackstone]] explained the subject of quickening in the eighteenth century, relative to [[feticide]] and [[abortion]]:

{{quote|Life... begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb. For if a woman is ''quick'' with child, and by a potion, or otherwise, killeth it in her womb; or if any one beat her, whereby the child dieth in her body, and she is delivered of a dead child; this, though not murder, was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter. But at present it is not looked upon in quite so atrocious a light, though it remains a very heinous misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Blackstone |authorlink=William Blackstone |chapter=Amendment IX, Document 1 |chapterurl=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs1.html |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] |origyear=1765 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |volume=5 |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, quickening was only one of several standards that were used historically to determine when the [[right to life]] attaches to a fetus.  According to the "ancient law" mentioned by Blackstone, another standard was [[formation of the fetus]], which occurs weeks before quickening.  [[Henry de Bracton]] explained the ancient law, about five hundred years before Blackstone:

{{quote|If one strikes a pregnant woman or gives her poison in order to procure an abortion, if the fetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened, he commits homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Henry de Bracton]] |chapter=The crime of homicide and the divisions into which it falls |editor=George E. Woodbine ed.; Samuel Edmund Thorne trans. |title=On the Laws and Customs of England |origyear=c. 1250 |year=1968 |volume=2 |page=[http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/bracton/Unframed/English/v2/341.htm 341] |oclc=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a woman convicted of a capital crime could claim a delay in her execution if she were pregnant; a woman who did so was said to "[[plead the belly]]". In Ireland on 16 March 1831 Baron Pennefather in Limerick stated that pregnancy was not alone sufficient for a delay but there had to be quickening.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Evening Post'' and ''Clare Sentinel'', 18 March 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC "Religion and Ethics"] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014915/http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html |date=2011-10-05 }} Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
Abortion, for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, and permanent sterilization are generally forbidden to [[Bahá'ís]] unless there is some medical reason for it. At present, Bahá'ís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Bahá'í writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Bahá'u'lláh | author2 =Abdu'l-Bahá |author3=Shoghi Effendi |author4=Universal House of Justice |editor-last =Hornby| editor-first = Helen| title =Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File | publisher =New Delhi: Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year =1983 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==

There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism]." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional sources, including some Buddhist monastic codes, hold that life begins at conception, and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, Peter. Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311–20&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that "life is a continuum with no discernible starting point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html Buddhism and Abortion on Patheos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301172029/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html |date=2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is no official or preferred viewpoint regarding abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Buddhism and abortion on BBC Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative", but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&amp;nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&amp;nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the "Old Testament" or "New Testament" books of the [[Christian Bible]].

==Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." The BBC goes on to state, "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] "Hinduism and abortion"&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S.

==Islam==

September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools of [[Sharia|Muslim law]] permit abortion in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow it in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The Qur'an does not specifically mention abortion, but it skirts the issue by condemning intentional murder. All schools accept abortion as a means to save the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Islam: Abortion|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the case-by-case decisions of [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]], and other rabbinic literature. Generally speaking, Orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Yevomot 69a states that prior to the 40th day, a foetus is "considered to be mere water"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grodzenski, Achiezer Vol. 3, 65:14&lt;/ref&gt; with health-related exceptions, and reform Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published by the [[Schlesinger institute]] on [[Judaism and abortion|abortion in Judaism]]: articles [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/jmeResults.asp?title=abortion&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in English] and [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/AsiaResults.asp?title=&amp;keywords=20&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in Hebrew], and the [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/tora/subject18.asp entry on abortion] from the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter.

The Hebrew Bible has a few references to abortion; Exodus 21:22-25 addresses [[miscarriage]] by way of another's actions, which it describes as a non-capital offense punishable through a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|21:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isser, Stanley.

==Sikhism==
Although the [[Sikh]] code of conduct does not deal directly with abortion (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female foetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, "...&lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904064958/http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml |date=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that should be free from interference by the state or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4707">'''Retail therapy''' is [[shopping]] with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or disposition. Often seen in people during periods of [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[stress (psychological)|stress]], it is normally a short-lived habit. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as "comfort buys" (compare [[comfort food]]).

The name ''retail therapy'' is [[irony#Verbal irony|ironic]] and [[wikt:semifacetious#Adjective|semifacetious]], acknowledging that shopping hardly qualifies as true [[therapy]] in the medical or [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] sense. It was first used in the 1980s, with the first reference being this sentence in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' of Christmas Eve 1986: "We've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-12-24/features/8604060073_1_shopping-shaky-ground-festive-hat |title=A Stopwatch On Shopping |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |last2= |first2= |date=24 December 1986 |work= |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that shopping may provide a short time of comfort (relief from [[dysphoria]]), but also imposes costs and is subject to [[comedown (drugs)|comedown]] and [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], make it, like [[opioid]] use, either a therapy or an [[addiction]], depending on whether each person uses it [[adaptive behavior|adaptively]] or [[maladaptation|maladaptively]]. Retail therapy thus exists on a spectrum with shopping addiction ([[compulsive buying disorder]]). In 2001, the European Union conducted a study finding that 33% of shoppers surveyed had "high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4181822,00.html |title=Shopping can make you depressed |date=6 May 2001 |last=Summerskill |first=Ben |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This habit was causing debt problems for many. The same study also found that young Scottish people had the highest susceptibility to binge purchasing. A 2013 survey of 1000 American adults found that slightly more than half had engaged in retail therapy, with the practice being more common among women (63.9% of women and 39.8% of men); women were most likely to buy clothing while men were most likely to buy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130402005600/en/Ebates-Survey-51.8-Americans-Engage-Retail-Therapy%E2%80%94 |title=Ebates Survey: More Than Half (51.8%) of Americans Engage in Retail Therapy - 63.9% of Women and 39.8% of Men Shop to Improve Their Mood |date=2 April 2013 |website=Business Wire |publisher=Business Wire, Inc. |access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research from professors at Youngstown State University found similar results (64% of women vs. 40% of men), with relief from anxiety being the most common reason for retail therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafcs.org/res/15_AC/presentations/RetailTherapy_Poster_Gitimu.pdf |title=Retail Therapy: Its relationship to Gender, Life Engagement, and Subjective Happiness |last=Njeri Gitimu |first=Priscilla |last2=Gitmu Waithaka |first2=Abel |publisher=Youngstown State University |access-date=10 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Melbourne University]] have advocated its classification as a psychological disorder called [[oniomania]] or compulsive shopping disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Editorial/Investigating-retail-therapy/2004/12/04/1101923382566.html |title=Investigating retail therapy |date=5 December 2004 |website=The Age |access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Window shopping]] can offer some of the comforts of shopping. The advantage is that many items and many stores can be enjoyed without cost{{snd}} far more than spending would allow. The disadvantage is that one cannot acquire or keep the items.

[[File:Spermatozoa-human-1000x.jpg|thumb|right|287px|[[spermatozoon|Spermatozoa]], in this case human, are a primary component in normal semen, and the agents of fertilization of female [[ovum|ova]].]]

'''Semen''', also known as '''seminal fluid''', is an organic [[fluid]] that may contain [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]. It is secreted by the [[gonad]]s (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of [[male]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[animal]]s and can [[fertilization|fertilize]] [[female]] [[ovum|ova]]. In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa, and provide a medium through which they can move or "swim". Semen is produced and originates from the [[seminal vesicle]], which is located in the pelvis. The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ''[[ejaculation]]''. Semen is also a form of genetic material. In animals, semen has been collected for cryoconservation. [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] is a practice that calls for the collection of genetic material in efforts for conservation of a particular breed.

==Physiology==
===Fertilization===
Depending on the [[species]], spermatozoa can fertilize ova externally or internally. In [[external fertilization]], the spermatozoa fertilize the ova directly, outside of the female's sexual organs. Female [[fish]], for example, [[spawn (biology)|spawn]] ova into their aquatic environment, where they are fertilized by the semen of the male fish.

During [[internal fertilization]], however, fertilization occurs inside the female's sexual organs. Internal fertilization takes place after [[insemination]] of a female by a male through [[copulation]]. In most [[vertebrate]]s, including [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[monotreme]] mammals, copulation is achieved through the physical mating of the [[cloaca]] of the male and female.&lt;ref name="Lombardi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Lombardi|title=Comparative Vertebrate Reproduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXvjBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=copulation&amp;f=false|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4615-4937-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[marsupial]] and [[Placentalia|placental mammal]]s, copulation occurs through the [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;Dewsbury, Donald A. "[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/407097 Patterns of copulatory behavior in male mammals]." The quarterly review of biology 47.1 (1972): 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human semen===
====Composition====
During the process of [[ejaculation]], sperm passes through the [[ejaculatory duct]]s and mixes with fluids from the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]]s to form the semen.  The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70% of human semen.&lt;ref name=Mann1954&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1954 |author=Mann, T |title=The Biochemistry of Semen |publisher=London: Methuen &amp; Co; New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons |url= https://archive.org/stream/biochemistryofse00mann#page/n5/mode/2up |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostatic secretion, influenced by dihydrotestosterone, is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes, citric acid, acid phosphatase and lipids.&lt;ref name=Mann1954/&gt; The bulbourethral glands secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the [[urethra]] to lubricate it.&lt;ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |authorlink=Arthur Guyton |year=1991|edition=8th|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|pages=890–891|isbn=0-7216-3994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sertoli cell]]s, which nurture and support developing [[spermatocyte]]s, secrete a fluid into seminiferous tubules that helps transport sperm to the genital ducts. The ductuli efferentes possess cuboidal cells with [[microvillus|microvilli]] and [[lysosome|lysosomal]] granules that modify the ductal fluid by reabsorbing some fluid. Once the semen enters the ductus epididymis the principal cells, which contain [[pinocytotic vessel]]s indicating fluid reabsorption, secrete glycerophosphocholine which most likely inhibits premature [[capacitation]]. The accessory genital ducts, the [[seminal vesicle]], [[prostate gland]]s, and the [[bulbourethral gland]]s, produce most of the seminal fluid.

Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] constituents.

The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract. The normal environment of the [[vagina]] is a hostile one (c.f. [[sexual conflict]]) for [[sperm]] cells, as it is very [[acidic]] (from the native microflora producing [[lactic acid]]), viscous, and patrolled by immune cells. The components in the seminal plasma attempt to compensate for this hostile environment. Basic [[amines]] such as [[putrescine]], [[spermine]], [[spermidine]] and [[cadaverine]] are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen. These alkaline bases counteract and buffer the acidic environment of the vaginal canal, and protect [[DNA]] inside the [[sperm]] from acidic denaturation.

The components and contributions of semen are as follows:

====Appearance and consistency====
[[File:Human semen in a petri dish.jpg|thumbnail|Human semen in a petri dish]]
Semen is typically translucent with white, grey or even yellowish tint. Blood in the semen can cause a pink or reddish colour, known as ''[[hematospermia]]'', and may indicate a medical problem which should be evaluated by a doctor if the symptom persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcentral.com/prostate/question-answer-27466-63.html|title=HealthCentral.com - Trusted, Reliable and Up To Date Health Information|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ejaculation, the latter part of the ejaculated semen [[Coagulation|coagulates]] immediately,&lt;ref name="Gallup, Gordon G; Burch, Rebecca L 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Gallup, Gordon G |author2=Burch, Rebecca L |title=[Semen Displacement as a Sperm Competition Strategy in Humans] |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=12–23 |year=2004 |url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/2/1/147470490400200105.full.pdf+html |accessdate=January 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming globules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2005 review found that the average reported viscosity of human semen in the literature was 3–7 cP.&lt;ref name="Owen2005" /&gt;

===Quality===
{{Main|Semen quality}}
Semen quality is a measure of the ability of semen to accomplish fertilization. Thus, it is a measure of fertility in a man. It is the sperm in the semen that is the fertile component, and therefore semen quality involves both sperm quantity and sperm quality.

===Quantity===
The volume of semen ejaculate varies but is generally about 1 teaspoonful or less. A review of 30 studies concluded that the average was around 3.4 milliliters (ml), with some studies finding amounts as high as 5.0 ml or as low as 2.3 ml.&lt;ref name="Owen2005" /&gt; In a study with Swedish and Danish men, a prolonged interval between [[ejaculations]] caused an increase of the sperm count in the semen but not an increase of its amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humrep/17.9.2468 |title=Higher sperm counts in Southern Sweden compared with Denmark |year=2002 |last1=Richthoff |first1=J. |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=2468–73 |pmid=12202443 |last2=Rylander |first2=L |last3=Hagmar |first3=L |last4=Malm |first4=J |last5=Giwercman |first5=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increasing semen volume====
Some [[dietary supplement]]s have been marketed with claims to increase seminal volume. Like other supplements, including so-called [[herbal viagra]], these are not approved or regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (as licensed medications would be), and none of the claims have been scientifically verified.  Similar claims are made about traditional [[aphrodisiac]] foods, with an equal lack of verification.

===Storage===
Semen can be stored in diluents such as the ''Illini Variable Temperature'' (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of semen for over seven days.&lt;ref name=Watson1993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/RD9930691 |title=The potential impact of sperm encapsulation technology on the importance of timing of artificial insemination: A perspective in the light of published work |year=1993 |last1=Watson |first1=PF |journal=Reproduction, Fertility and Development |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=691–9 |pmid=9627729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVT diluent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Watson1993/&gt;

[[Semen cryopreservation]] can be used for far longer storage durations. For human sperm, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Child born after 21 year semen storage using Planer controlled rate freezer |publisher=Planer |url=http://www.planer.com/company/news/older-news-stories/335-child-born-after-21-year-semen-storage-using-planer-controlled-rate-freezer-.html |accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

===Disease transmission===
Semen can transmit many [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and [[pathogen]]s, including viruses like [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="Aldo "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poiani, Aldo |date= July 2006 |title=Complexity of Seminal Fluid: A Review |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages= 295–296|jstor=25063816 |doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ebola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Doctors-sweat-over-whether-Ebola-positive-man-spread-virus/articleshow/45210667.cms|title=Doctors sweat over whether Ebola positive man spread virus|work=Times of India|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swallowing semen carries no additional risk other than those inherent in [[fellatio]]. This includes transmission risk for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) or [[herpes]], especially for people with bleeding gums, gingivitis or open sores.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Sara.

===Blood in semen (hematospermia)===
{{Main|Hematospermia}}

The presence of blood in semen or [[hematospermia]] may be undetectable (it only can be seen microscopically) or visible in the fluid. Its cause could be the result of [[inflammation]], [[infection]], blockage, or injury of the male reproductive tract or a problem within the [[urethra]], [[testicles]], [[epididymis]] or [[prostate]]. It usually clears up without treatment, or with [[antibiotics]], but if persistent further [[semen analysis]] and other [[urogenital|urogenital system]] tests might be needed to find out the cause.

===Semen allergy===
In rare circumstances, humans can develop an allergy to semen, called human seminal plasma sensitivity. It appears as a typical localized or systemic [[allergic response]] upon contact with seminal fluid. There is no one protein in semen responsible for the reaction. Symptoms can appear after first intercourse or after subsequent intercourse. A semen allergy can be distinguished from a latex allergy by determining if the symptoms disappear with use of a [[condom]]. Desensitization treatments are often very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3810/pgm.2011.01.2253 |journal = Postgraduate Medicine |title = Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity: An Under-Recognized Women's Health Issue |first = Jonathan A. |last = Bernstein |date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity Reactions: An Updated Review |first1 = J. Wesley |last1 = Sublett |first2 = Jonathan A. |last2 = Bernstein |date = 2011 |journal = Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine |doi = 10.1002/msj.20283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits to females===
Females may benefit from absorbing seminal fluid. Such benefits include male insects transferring nutrients to females via their ejaculate; in both humans and bovines, the fluid has antiviral and antibacterial properties; and useful bacteria such as [[Lactobacillus]] have been detected in fluid transferred from birds and mammals.&lt;ref name="Aldo "/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Qigong===

[[Qigong]] and [[Chinese medicine]] place huge emphasis on a form of energy called 精 ([[pinyin]]: jīng, also a morpheme denoting "essence" or "spirit")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chikung.com/wp-content/files/chikungbible.pdf Qigong Bible, Chapter #8], by Gary J. Clyman. Contribution To Clyman's Book by Frank Ranz, January 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunyuantaijiacademy.com/Articles/On%20Qigong.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930101010/http://www.hunyuantaijiacademy.com/Articles/On%20Qigong.aspx |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Home |publisher=hunyuantaijiacademy.com |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – which one attempts to develop and accumulate. "Jing" is sexual energy and is considered to dissipate with ejaculation so [[masturbation]] is considered "energy suicide" amongst those who practice this art. According to Qigong theory, energy from many pathways/meridians becomes diverted and transfers itself to the sexual organs during sexual excitement. The ensuing orgasm and ejaculation will then finally expel the energy from the system completely. The Chinese proverb 一滴精，十滴血 (pinyin: yì dī jīng, shí dī xuè, literally: a drop of semen is equal to ten drops of blood) illustrates this point.

The scientific term for semen in Chinese is 精液 (pinyin: jīng yè, literally: fluid of essence/jing) and the term for [[spermatozoon|sperm]] is 精子 (pinyin: jīng zǐ, literally: basic element of essence/jing), two modern terms with classical referents.

===Greek philosophy===
In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] remarked on the importance of semen: "For Aristotle, semen is the residue derived from nourishment, that is of blood, that has been highly concocted to the optimum temperature and substance. This can only be emitted by the male as only the male, by nature of his very being, has the requisite heat to concoct blood into semen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The connection between food and physical growth, on the one hand, and semen, on the other, allows Aristotle to warn against "engag[ing] in sexual activity at too early an age ... [since] this will affect the growth of their bodies. Nourishment that would otherwise make the body grow is diverted to the production of semen. Aristotle is saying that at this stage the ''body'' is still growing; it is best for sexual activity to begin when its growth is 'no longer abundant', for when the body is more or less at full height, the transformation of nourishment into semen does not drain the body of needed material."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Additionally, "Aristotle tells us that the region round the eyes was the region of the head most fruitful of seed ("most seedy" σπερματικώτατος), pointing to generally recognised effects upon the eyes of sexual indulgence and to practices which imply that seed comes from liquid in the region of the eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Onians|first=R. B.|title=The Origins of European Thought|publisher=Cambridge|year=1951|page=203|isbn=0-405-04853-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by the belief of the [[Pythagoreans]] that "semen is a drop of the brain [τὸ δε σπέρμα εἶναι σταγόνα ἐγκέφαλου]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fxylib.znufe.edu.cn/wgfljd/%B9%C5%B5%E4%D0%DE%B4%C7%D1%A7/pw/diogenes/dlpythagoras.htm Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Pythagoras'', 19.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406133611/http://fxylib.znufe.edu.cn/wgfljd/%EF%BF%BD%C5%B5%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%DE%B4%EF%BF%BD%D1%A7/pw/diogenes/dlpythagoras.htm |date=2016-04-06 }} {{Cite book|first=Justin E.

Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy conceived of the ''[[Logos]] spermatikos'' ("seminal word") as the principle of active reason that fecundated passive [[matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tripolitis|first=Antonia|year=2002|title=Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age|pages=37–38|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4913-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] similarly spoke in sexual terms of the Logos as the masculine principle of reason that sowed seeds of virtue in the feminine soul.&lt;ref&gt;"And when she (intelligence) lives as a comely wife with comely Reason (Logos), that is with virtuous Reason, this self-same Reason himself undertakes the care of her, sowing, like a husband, the most excellent concepts in her." Philo, ''De Spec. Leg.'', § 7. {{Cite book| authorlink = G.R.S.

The Christian Platonist [[Clement of Alexandria]] likened the Logos to physical blood&lt;ref&gt;"And that the blood is the Word, is testified by the blood of Abel, the righteous interceding with God." [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02091.htm Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 47.]&lt;/ref&gt; as the "substance of the soul",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:14}}; Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that some held "that the animal semen is substantially foam of its blood".&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Clement reflected an early Christian view that "the seed ought not be wasted nor scattered thoughtlessly nor sown in a way it cannot grow."&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 2, 91. See also: [[Onan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were believed to have their own version, which was stored in the womb and released during climax. Retention was believed to cause [[female hysteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roach|first=Mary|title=Bonk: the curious coupling of science and sex|year=2009|publisher=W.W.

In [[ancient Greek religion]] as a whole, semen is considered a form of [[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]], and [[ritual purification]] was to be practised after its discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Robert. 1996. Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred semen===
In some [[pre-industrial]] societies, semen and other body fluids were revered because they were believed to be magical. [[Blood]] is an example of such a fluid, but semen was also widely believed to be of supernatural origin and effect and was, as a result, considered holy or sacred. The ancient [[Sumer]]ians believed that semen was "a divine substance, endowed on humanity by [[Enki]]", the god of water.&lt;ref name="Leick2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen of a god was believed to have magical generative powers.&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt;{{rp|49}} In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], when Enki's seed was planted in the ground, it caused the spontaneous growth of eight previously-nonexistent plants.&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Thorkild|date=1987|title=The Harps that Once--: Sumerian Poetry in Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-BI0h41yCEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Uttu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivxKmTy7fYAhWBQ98KHWxSBNkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Uttu&amp;f=false|location=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07278-3|page=184|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enki was believed to have created the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty [[Stream bed|riverbeds]].&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt;{{rp|32, 49}} The Sumerians believed that rain was the semen of the sky-god [[Anu|An]],&lt;ref name="NemetNajat1996"&gt;{{citation|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=182|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fell from the heavens to inseminate his consort, the earth-goddess [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]],&lt;ref name="NemetNajat1996"/&gt; causing her to give birth to all the plants of the earth.&lt;ref name="NemetNajat1996"/&gt;

[[Dew]] was once thought to be a sort of rain that fertilized the earth and, in time, became a metaphor for semen. The [[Bible]] employs the term "dew" in this sense in such verses as [[Song of Solomon]] 5:2&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+Solomon+5%3A2&amp;version=KJV Song of Solomon 5:2 KJV - I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the] Bible Gateway&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Psalm]] 110:3, declaring, in the latter verse, for example, that the people should follow only a king who was virile enough to be full of the "dew" of youth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+110%3A3&amp;version=KJV Psalm 110:3 KJV - Thy people shall be willing in the day] Bible Gateway&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[orchid]]'s twin bulbs were thought to resemble the [[testicles]], which is the etymology of the disease [[orchiditis]]. There was an ancient Roman belief that the flower sprang from the spilled semen of copulating [[satyr]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In a number of mythologies around the world, semen is often considered analogous to [[breast milk]]. In the traditions of Bali, it is considered to be the returning or refunding of the milk of the mother in an alimentary metaphor. The wife feeds her husband who returns to her his semen, the milk of human kindness, as it were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bellows |first1=Laura J. |year=2003 |title=Personhood, procreative fluids, and power: re-thinking hierarchy in Bali |oclc=224223971}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Borborites]], also known as the Phibionites, were an early Christian [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sect during the late fourth century AD whose alleged practices involving sacred semen are described by the early Christian heretic-hunter [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in his ''[[Panarion]]''.&lt;ref name="Ehrman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|date=2006|title=Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tlvgp7WggvEC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=Ehrman+%22to+you+as+apostles%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehrman%20%22to%20you%20as%20apostles%22&amp;f=false|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530013-0|pages=234–235|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epiphanius"&gt;[https://archive.is/20151013103634/http://www.masseiana.org/panarion_bk1.htm%23First Epiphanius of Salamis 26.8.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Young Richard|title=Epiphanius of Cyprus: Imagining an Orthodox World|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|isbn=978-0-472-11954-7|pages=37–39|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rrR0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}

Ehrman]], a scholar of early Christianity, casts doubt on the accuracy of Epiphanius's summary, commenting that "the details of Epiphanius's description sound very much like what you can find in the ancient rumor mill about secret societies in the ancient world".&lt;ref name="Ehrman2006"/&gt;

In some cultures, semen is considered to have special properties associated with [[masculinity]]. Several tribes of [[Papua New Guinea]], including the [[Sambia people|Sambia]] and the [[Etoro people|Etoro]], believe that semen promotes sexual maturation among the younger men of their tribe. To them, semen possesses the manly nature of the tribal elders, and in order to pass down their authority and powers, younger men of their next generation must  [[fellatio|fellate]] their elders and ingest their semen. Prepubescent and postpubescent males are required to engage in this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Francoeur, Raymond J. Noonan (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA819 ''The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality''] p.819&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/56 |title=Semen Warriors Of New Guinea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420042040/http://www.gettingit.com/article/56 |archivedate=2015-04-20 |author=Hank Hyena |date=September 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act may also be associated with the culturally active homosexuality throughout these and other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Sexual practices====
There are several sexual practices involving the ingestion of semen. They can be done with one or more partners, like [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]], [[felching]] and [[Creampie (sexual act)|creampie eating]], or with multiple partners, like the practices of [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]] and [[gokkun]], which originate from Japan.

===Euphemisms===
A huge variety of [[euphemism]]s and [[dysphemism]]s have been invented to describe semen. For a complete list of terms, see ''[[sexual slang]]''.

Slang terms for semen include '''cum''', '''jizz''', '''spunk''' (primarily [[British English]]), '''spooge''' and/or '''splooge''', '''load''', '''nut''', and less commonly, '''love juice'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointsincase.com/columns/nick-3-29-06-htm|title=Proper Use of Ejaculatory Slang: Male Finishing School, Part I|location=Points in Case|author=NG Hatfield|date=31 May 2008|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rafik |first=Amal |date= |title=Passion Masters: Sex Secrets of a Forbidden Cult |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passion_Masters.html?id=isZ1HAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en |location=[[Google Books]] |publisher=Blue Moon Books |page= |isbn=978-1562012007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''cum'' sometimes also refers to an [[orgasm]],  while ''load'' is derived from the phrase ''blowing a load'', referring to an ejaculation.

'''Stereolithography''' ('''SLA''' or '''SL'''; also known as '''stereolithography apparatus''', '''optical fabrication''', '''photo-solidification''', or '''resin printing''') is a form of [[3D printing]] technology used for creating [[Scale model|model]]s, [[prototype]]s, [[pattern]]s, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using [[photopolymerization]], a process by which light causes chains of molecules to link, forming [[polymers]].&lt;ref name=Patent&gt;[[U.S. Patent]] [https://patents.google.com/patent/US4575330A/en 4,575,330] (“Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography”)&lt;/ref&gt; Those polymers then make up the body of a three-dimensional solid. Research in the area had been conducted during the 1970s, but the term was coined by [[Chuck Hull]] in 1984 when he applied for a patent on the process, which was granted in 1986. Stereolithography can be used to create things such as prototypes for products in development, medical models, and computer hardware, as well as in many other applications. While stereolithography is fast and can produce almost any design, it can be expensive.

==History==
Stereolithography or "SLA" printing is an early and widely used 3D printing technology. In the early 1980s, Japanese researcher Hideo Kodama first invented the modern layered approach to stereolithography by using ultraviolet light to cure photosensitive polymers.&lt;ref name=Gibson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://formlabs.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-stereolithography-sla-3d-printing/#sla-systems|title=The Ultimate Guide to Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printing|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=&lt;!--No Date Stated--&gt; |website=[[Formlabs]] |publisher=Formlabs, Inc. |access-date=26 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, just before Chuck Hull filed his own patent, [[Alain Le Mehaute]], [[Olivier de Witte]] and [[Jean Claude André]] filed a patent for the stereolithography process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Andre|last = Jean-Claude|title = Disdpositif pour realiser un modele de piece industrielle|newspaper = National De La Propriete Industrielle|url = http://bases-brevets.inpi.fr/fr/document/FR2567668/publications.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French inventors' patent application was abandoned by the [[French General Electric Company]] (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and [[CILAS]] (The Laser Consortium). Le Mehaute believes that the abandonment reflects a problem with innovation in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Alexandre|last = Moussion|title = Interview d’Alain Le Méhauté, l’un des pères de l’impression 3D|newspaper = Primante 3D|date = 2014|url = http://www.primante3d.com/inventeur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Mehaute Reflections"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://3dprint.com/65466/reflections-alain-le-mehaute/|title = Alain Le Méhauté, The Man Who Submitted Patent For SLA 3D Printing Before Chuck Hull|date = May 15, 2015|access-date = |website=3dprint.com |publisher =3DR Holdings, LLC |last = Mendoza|first = Hannah Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term “stereolithography” was coined in 1984 by [[Chuck Hull]] when he filed his patent for the process.&lt;ref name=Patent/&gt;&lt;ref name=photopolymer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photopolymer.com/stereolithography.htm |title=Stereolithography / 3D Printing / Additive Fabrication |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Photopolymers |publisher=Savla Associates |access-date=10 August 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214125415/http://www.photopolymer.com/stereolithography.htm |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck Hull patented stereolithography as a method of creating 3D objects by successively "printing" thin layers of an object using a medium curable by [[ultraviolet light]], starting from the bottom layer to the top layer. Hull's patent described a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light focused onto the surface of a vat filled with a liquid photopolymer. The beam is focused onto the surface of the liquid photopolymer, creating each layer of the desired 3D object by means of [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] (generation of intermolecular bonds in polymers). It was invented with the intent of allowing engineers to create prototypes of their designs in a more time effective manner.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Gibson, Ian, and Jorge Bártolo, Paulo. “History of Stereolithography.” Stereolithography: Materials, Processes, and Applications.

Stereolithography's success in the automotive industry allowed 3D printing to achieve industry status and the technology continues to find innovative uses in many fields of study.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Paul F. “Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing.” Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing: Fundamentals of Stereolithography. 1st Ed. (1992): 4-6. Print. 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to construct mathematical models of stereolithography processes and to design algorithms to determine whether a proposed object may be constructed using 3D printing.&lt;ref&gt;B. Asberg, G. Blanco, [[Jit Bose|P. Bose]], J. Garcia-Lopez, [[Mark Overmars|M. Overmars]], [[Godfried Toussaint|G. Toussaint]], G. Wilfong and B. Zhu, "Feasibility of design in stereolithography," ''Algorithmica'', Special Issue on Computational Geometry in Manufacturing, Vol. 19, No. 1/2, Sept/Oct, 1997, pp. 61–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process that works by focusing an ultraviolet (UV) laser on to a vat of [[photopolymer]] resin.&lt;ref&gt;Crivello, James V., and Elsa Reichmanis. "Photopolymer Materials and Processes for Advanced Technologies." Chemistry of Materials Chem. Mater. 26.1 (2014): 533. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of computer aided manufacturing or [[computer-aided design]] (CAM/CAD) software&lt;ref name="Lipson, Hod 2004"&gt;Lipson, Hod, Francis C. Moon, Jimmy Hai, and Carlo Paventi. "3-D Printing the History of Mechanisms." Journal of Mechanical Design J. Mech. Des. (2004): 1029-033. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;, the UV laser is used to draw a pre-programmed design or shape on to the surface of the photopolymer vat. Photopolymers are sensitive to ultraviolet light, so the resin is photochemically solidified and forms a single layer of the desired 3D object.&lt;ref&gt;Fouassier, J. P. "Photopolymerization Reactions." The Wiley Database of Polymer Properties 3 (2003): 25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the build platform lowers one layer and a blade recoats the top of the tank with resin.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt; This process is repeated for each layer of the design until the 3D object is complete. Completed parts must be washed with a [[solvent]] to clean wet resin off their surfaces.&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Dong|last=Ngo|title = Formlabs Form 2 3D Printer review: An excellent 3D printer for a hefty price|url = http://www.cnet.com/products/formlabs-form-2-3d-printer/#!|website = [[CNET]]|accessdate = 3 August 2016|quote=More specifically, as the print platform lowers itself into the resin glass tank, an ultraviolet laser light, from underneath the see-through tank, shines on it. (For this reason, SLA is sometimes called the laser 3D-printing technology.) Exposed to the laser light, the resin cures, solidifies and sticks to the platform. As more resin is exposed to the laser light, the pattern is created and joins the layer above. As more and more layers are being created, the build platform slowly -- very slowly -- moves upward, finally pulling the entire object out of the tank as the print process is finished.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to print objects "bottom up" by using a vat with a transparent bottom and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through the bottom of the vat.&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review" /&gt; An inverted stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform to touch the bottom of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part through the transparent vat bottom. Then the vat is "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches from the bottom of the vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer. This approach is typical of desktop SLA printers, while the right-side-up approach is more common in industrial systems.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt;

Stereolithography requires the use of supporting structures which attach to the elevator platform to prevent [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] due to gravity, resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blade, or retain newly created sections during the "vat rocking" of bottom up printing. Supports are typically created automatically during the preparation of CAD models and can also be made manually. In either situation, the supports must be removed manually after printing.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt;

In these images different tissues show up as different levels of grey. Selecting a range of grey values enables specific tissues to be isolated. A region of interest is then selected and all the pixels connected to the target point within that grey value range are selected. This enables a specific organ to be selected. This process is referred to as segmentation. The segmented data may then be translated into a format suitable for stereolithography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibb|first=Richard|title=Medical Modelling: the application of advanced design and development technologies in medicine|year=2006|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84569-138-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While stereolithography is normally accurate, the accuracy of a medical model depends on many factors, especially the operator performing the segmentation correctly. There are potential errors possible when making medical models using stereolithography but these can be avoided with practice and well trained operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winder|first=RJ|author2=Bibb, R |title=Medical Rapid Prototyping Technologies: State of the Art and Current Limitations for Application in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|journal=Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|year=2005|volume=63|issue=7|pages=1006–15|doi=10.1016/j.joms.2005.03.016|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/14449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereolithographic models are used as an aid to diagnosis, preoperative planning and implant design and manufacture. This might involve planning and rehearsing [[Osteotomy|osteotomies]], for example. Surgeons use models to help plan surgeries&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{Cite web|title = Applications of SLA|date= |url = https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rapidproto/students.98/master/project2/applications.html|website= Stereolithography|publisher= |accessdate = 7 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prosthetists and technologists also use models as an aid to the design and manufacture of custom-fitting implants. For instance, medical models created through stereolithography can be used to help in the construction of [[Cranioplasty]] plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=D'Urso |first1=Paul |last2=Effeney |first2=David |last3=Earwaker |first3=W.

===Prototyping===

Stereolithography is often used for prototyping parts. For a relatively low price, Stereolithography can produce accurate prototypes, even of irregular shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Palermo|title = What is Stereolithography?|date= 16 July 2013|url = http://www.livescience.com/38190-stereolithography.html|website = [[Live Science]]|publisher= [[Purch Group]]|accessdate =7 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses can use those prototypes to assess the design of their product or as publicity for the final product.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
One of the advantages of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt; The length of time it takes to produce a single part depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. Printing time can last anywhere from hours to more than a day.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt; Prototypes and designs made with stereolithography are strong enough to be [[machining|machined]]&lt;ref name=Proto3000&gt;{{cite web |url=https://proto3000.com/stereolithography-rapid-prototyping-solutions-sla-applications.php |title=Sterolithography |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Proto3000 |publisher=Proto3000 Inc. |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://luma3dprint.com/3d-print-technologies/ |title=3D Print technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Luma 3D Print |publisher=LUMA-iD Ltd. |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used to make master patterns for [[injection molding]] or various [[metal casting]] processes.&lt;ref name=Proto3000 /&gt;
===Disadvantages===
Although stereolithography can be used to produce virtually any synthetic design,&lt;ref name="Lipson, Hod 2004"/&gt; it is often costly; common photopolymers can cost about {{US$|800|link=yes}} per gallon and SLA machines can cost {{US$|250000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/stereolith.htm |title=How Stereolithography 3-D Layering Works |last1=Brain |first1=Marshall |website=[[Howstuffworks]] |publisher=Infospace LLC |access-date=17 December 2015|date=2000-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/formlabs-fuse1-sls-printer-news/ |title=With lasers and hot nylon, Formlabs just took 3D printing to a whole new level |last=Prindle |first=Drew |date=6 June 2017 |website=[[Digital Trends]] |publisher=Designtechnica Corporation |access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, public interest in 3D printing has inspired the design of several consumer SLA machines which can cost {{US$|3500}} or less, such as the [[Formlabs#Form 2|Form 2]] by [[Formlabs]]&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review"/&gt; or the Nobel 1.0 by XYZPrinting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Dong|last=Ngo|title = XYZprinting Nobel 1.0 3D Printer review: Highly detailed prints at a high cost |url = http://www.cnet.com/products/xyzprinting-nobel-1-0-3d-printer/|website = [[CNET]]|accessdate = 3 August 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J. Hoffman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/to-save-humanity-9780190221546?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=To Save Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vox (website)|Vox]] has republished several of the articles for free online as part of a series entitled "One Change to Save the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/one-change-to-save-the-world|title=One change to save the world|website=www.vox.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Urethroceles can often result as a result of damage to the supporting structures of the pelvic floor.

Urethroceles are often caused by childbirth, the movement of the baby through the vagina causing damage to the surrounding tissues.&lt;ref name="Webmd" /&gt; When they occur in women who have never had children, they may be the result of a [[congenital]] weakness in the tissues of the [[pelvic floor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Symptoms==
There are often no symptoms associated with a urethrocele.&lt;ref name="JC" /&gt; When present, symptoms include [[stress incontinence]], increased [[Frequent urination|urinary frequency]], and [[urinary retention]] (difficulty in emptying the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]).&lt;ref name="JC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JOB" /&gt; Pain during [[sexual intercourse]] may also occur.&lt;ref name="Webmd" /&gt;

==Treatment==
A urethrocele can be treated surgically.&lt;ref name="AO" /&gt;

==Complications==
Where a urethrocele causes difficulty in urinating, this can lead to [[cystitis]].&lt;ref name="JC" /&gt;

== Historical ==

The influential Massachusetts preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with [[Edward Jenner]], the pioneer of smallpox [[vaccination]], and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to.&lt;ref name="Bazin2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Bazin|title=The eradication of smallpox: Edward Jenner and the first and only eradication of a human infectious disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=19 January 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-083475-4|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a tract on the subject in 1806,&lt;ref name="GlynnGlynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Glynn|author2=Jenifer Glynn|title=The Life and Death of Smallpox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL4W3YNMYLIC&amp;pg=PA112|date=30 August 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84542-7|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. [[John C. Lettsom]], an eminent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:

: "You have done more good than you imagine; and for everyone you may have saved by your actual operation, you have saved ten by your example; and perhaps, next to [[Edward Jenner|Jenner]], have been the means of saving more lives than any other individual."&lt;ref name="Rhodes2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rhodes|title=The End of Plagues: The Global Battle Against Infectious Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdRWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=24 September 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-38131-6|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Mindell, The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007 [2006]), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When vaccination was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;Durbach, Nadja. 2005. ''Bodily matters: the anti-vaccination movement in England, 1853–1907''. Radical perspectives. Durham: Duke University Press. pp 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-vaccinationists]] were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006.''

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a number of [[Vaccination Acts]] were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when [[variolation|smallpox inoculation]] was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination  enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in [[Leicester]], a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898  Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law. &lt;!-- see Talk and Hansard--&gt;A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness6.htm About the Jehovah's Witnesses Christian denomination - Past opposition to vaccinations], religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative Christian groups in the United States oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact. For example, the [[Family Research Council]] opposes mandatory [[HPV vaccine|vaccination against HPV]], a virus that causes various cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hpv.html|title=Pinkbook - HPV - Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing, "Our primary concern is with the message that would be delivered to nine- to 12-year-olds with the administration of the vaccines.

The use of [[fetal tissue in vaccines|fetal tissue in the development of vaccines]] has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to [[abortion]]. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year= 2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher= Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url= http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo/vacc/vacc&amp;lang=english |accessdate= 2008-12-03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060507072740/http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo%2Fvacc%2Fvacc&amp;lang=english |archivedate= 2006-05-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."&lt;ref name=Vatican/&gt;

===Political opposition to vaccination by religious groups===

The majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/news/statement-vaccinations-ou-rabbinical-council-america/|title=Statement on Vaccinations from the OU and Rabbinical Council of America|publisher=Orthodox Union|date=2015-02-10|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/205801/are-ultra-orthodox-turning-away-from-vaccination/?p=all|title=Are Ultra-Orthodox Turning Away From Vaccination?|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|work=Forward|date=2014-09-17|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 imams in northern [[Nigeria]] advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29781528/ns/health-infectious_diseases/t/muslim-clerics-finally-embrace-polio-campaign/#.VQC3WIF4qcY|title=Muslim Clerics Finally Embrace Polio Campaign|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries.

== Exemptions ==

In the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in [[Massachusetts]], the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/07363761111181464|title=Against medical advice: the anti-consumption of vaccines|date=|website=|publisher=The University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, New Zealand|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf |author= American Medical Association |title= Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA House of Delegates |quote= H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations |format=PDF |pages=460–61 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Central theories are [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], [[Carol Ryff|Ryff's]] [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], [[Corey Keyes|Corey Keyes']] work on [[flourishing]], and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]]'s contributions to [[positive psychology]] and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|P.E.R.M.A.]]

Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], "eudaimonia trumps hedonism".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"&gt;Christopher Peterson (2008), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not ''What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann cover a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

The pursuit&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://thriving.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Catalino - Prioritizing Positivity (Simon-Thomas Lecture).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of happiness predicts both positive emotions and less depressive symptoms. People&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; who prioritize happiness are more psychologically able, all else held equal.

== Methodology of study ==

=== Well-being measurement ===
Different ways of measuring well-being reveal different contributing factors. The correlation between two of these, life satisfaction and happiness, in the World Values Survey (1981–2005) is only 0.47.&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/viewFile/364/477 |title=A statistical meta-analysis of the wellbeing literature |website=internationaljournalofwellbeing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are different, but related concepts which are used interchangeably outside of academia. Typically, life satisfaction, or evaluative wellbeing is measured with Cantril’s self-anchoring ladder, a questionnaire where wellbeing is rated on a scale from 1–10. Happiness or hedonic/Affective well-being measurement is measured with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), a more complex scale.

=== Limitations ===
The UK Government's Department of Health compiled a factsheet in 2014, in which it is stated that the key limitations to well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction research are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-and-health-policy|title=Wellbeing and health policy - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous associations and correlations in the body of evidence, but few causal relationships, since existing longitudinal datasets "''do not use consistent wellbeing and predictor measures at different time points''";
* After controlling for mental health status, not many of the found associations are still significant;
* Subgroup analyses are rare;
* There are too few studies to conduct meta-analyses;
* There are too few interventional studies.

== Major factors ==

=== For evaluative well-being (life satisfaction) ===
Mental health is the strongest&lt;ref&gt;[http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.as ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual predictor of life satisfaction. Mental illness is associated&lt;ref name=pmid26321990&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garaigordobil M | title = Predictor variables of happiness and its connection with risk and protective factors for health | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | pages = 1176 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26321990 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with poorer well-being. In fact, mental health is the strongest determinant of quality of life at a later age.

Studies&lt;ref name=pmid10784456&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendlowicz MV, Stein MB | title = Quality of life in individuals with anxiety disorders | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–82 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10784456 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the relationship between anxiety and quality of life.

The VOXEU&lt;ref name="voxeu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of happiness showed the principal determinants of an adult’s life satisfaction to be income, parenting, family break up, mother's mental health and schooling.
The factors that explain life satisfaction roughly map (negatively) to those factors that explain misery. They are first and foremost diagnosed depression/anxiety, which explains twice as much as the next factor, physical health (number of medical conditions), that explains just as much variance in subjective well-being between people, as income and whether someone is partnered.
These factors count twice as much as each of whether someone is employed and whether they are a non-criminal, which in turn are 3 times as important as years of education.

Overall, the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child as reported by the mother and child. It trumps factors like the qualifications that someone gets and their behaviour at 16 as reported by the mother. A child and therefore an adult's emotional health is most affected itself by a mother's mental health, which is just over twice as important as family income.
2/3 as important as family income is parent's involvement, which is 0.1 partial correlation coefficients more important than aggressive parenting (negative), father's unemployment (negative), family conflict (negative) and whether the mother worked in the subject's 1st year of life.

Whether the mother worked thereafter has 0 correlation with well-being, however. In terms of non-family factors, the place where someone goes to secondary school matters a fair bit more than observed family background altogether, which in turn is slightly more important than the place where someone went to primary school.

=== For affective well-being (happiness) ===

The main determinants of affective well-being, by correlation and effect size are:&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"/&gt;

# Corruption index (-0.54)
# Public service quality (0.40)
# GDP per capita (although, there is evidence of publication bias) (0.39)
# Economic freedom (0.35)
# Human rights violations (-0.33)
# Political and economic violence (-0.28)
# Life expectancy at birth (0.27)
# Unemployment (0.19)
# Are you married (0.07)

Determinants that correlate highly with one another, for instance, alternative ways of measuring corruption, are excluded from this list.

== Biological factors ==

=== Gender ===
Over the last 33 years, a significant decrease in women's happiness leads researchers to believe that men are happier than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=B. |last2=Wolfers |first2=J. |year=2009|title=The paradox of declining female happiness |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume= 1 |issue=2 |pages=190–225. |doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a Pew Research Centre survey found that more women are satisfied with their lives than men, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-or-women-happier.htm|title=Are men or women happier?|date=20 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found no gender gap in happiness.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Happiness Inequality in the United States |first1=Betsey |last1=Stevenson |first2=Justin |last2=Wolfers |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=S2 |pages=S33–S79 |doi=10.1086/592004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these findings could be due to the way men and women differ in calculating their happiness. Women calculate the positive self-esteem, closeness in their relationships and religion. Men calculate positive self-esteem, active leisure and mental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Gender and sources of subjective well-being | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 51 | issue = 11/12| pages = 617–629 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-004-0714-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither men nor women are at greater risk for being less happy than the other. Earlier in life, women are more likely than men to fulfill their goals (material goals and family life aspirations), thereby increasing their [[life satisfaction]] and overall happiness. However, it is later in life that men fulfill their goals, are more satisfied with their family life and financial situation and, as a result, their overall happiness surpasses that of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plagnol A, Easterlin R |title=Aspirations, attainments, and satisfaction: life cycle differences between American women and men |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=601–619 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9106-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible explanations include the unequal division of labor within the household,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mencarini L, Sironi M |title=Happiness, Housework and Gender Inequality in Europe |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=0 |issue=2 |pages=1–17 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that women experience more variance (more extremes) in emotion but are ''generally'' happier.&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap" /&gt; Effects of gender on well-being are paradoxical: men report feeling less happy than women,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, women are more susceptible to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strickland B |title=Women and depression |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=132–5 |year=1992 |jstor=20182155 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted by Siamak Khodarahimi to determine the roles of gender and age on positive psychology constructs – psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness – among 200 Iranian adolescents and 200 young adults who were questioned through various tests. The study found that the males of the sample showed significantly higher rates in psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness than females, regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khodarahimi|first1=Siamak | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Role of Gender on Positive Psychology Constructs in a Sample of Iranian Adolescents and Young adults|journal=Applied Research in Quality of Life|date=5 February 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining whether emotions have a genetic trait or not were studied by David Lykken and Auke Tellegen. They found that up to 80% of a long-term sense of [[well-being]] is due to heredity. Basically, our families are important to our eventual emotional lives as adults because they provide us with genetic material that largely determines our base [[emotional]] responsiveness to the world. Therefore, [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is far more important to the long-term quality of our emotional lives than is learned behavior or the quality of our early childhood environment, at least as found in our current socio-economic paradigm.&lt;ref name="Lykken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykken D, Tellegen A | year = 1996 | title = Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 186–189 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining theoretical 20%, however, still leaves room for significant change in thoughts and behavior from environmental/learned sources that should not be understated, and the interpretation of variance in twin studies is controversial, even among clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://vaughanbell.net/nature-vs-nurture-is-a-lie/ |title= Nature vs nurture is a lie | last1 = Bell | first1 = Vaughan | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Psychologist | date = July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with [[self-control]], and in the facets of eudaimonia are inheritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of this trait, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.&lt;ref name="pmid22432931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archontaki D, Lewis GJ, Bates TC | title = Genetic influences on psychological well-being: a nationally representative twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–30 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22432931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
It is generally accepted that happiness is at least in part mediated through [[dopaminergic]], [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dfarhud D, Malmir M, Khanahmadi M | title = Happiness &amp; Health: The Biological Factors- Systematic Review Article | journal = Iranian Journal of Public Health | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1468–77 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 26060713 | pmc = 4449495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been found between [[hormone]] levels and happiness. [[SSRI]]s, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of [[serotonin]] in the [[Major depressive disorder|clinically unhappy]]. Researchers, such as [[Bruce K. Alexander|Alexander]], have indicated that many peoples usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Bruce K. | title=Rat Park |journal=Psychopharmacology |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato W, Kochiyama T, Uono S, Kubota Y, Sawada R, Yoshimura S, Toichi M | title = The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 16891 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586449 | pmc = 4653620 | doi = 10.1038/srep16891 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516891S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meditation]] based interventions, including [[mindfulness]], have been found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

=== Neuroscience's findings ===
[[Neuroscience]] and brain imaging have shown increasing potential for helping science understand happiness and sadness. Though it may be impossible to achieve any comprehensive objective measure of happiness, some physiological correlates to happiness can be measured. [[Stefan Klein]], in his book ''The Science of Happiness'', links the dynamics of [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] systems (i.e., dopaminergic, opiate) to the concepts and findings of positive psychology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan | last = Klein | authorlink = Stefan Klein | title = The Science of Happiness | publisher = Marlowe &amp; Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56924-328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] and researcher Cynthia Fu described very accurate diagnoses of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] just by looking at fMRI brain scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05 |title=Diagnosis – Radiolab |publisher=Wnyc.org |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By identifying [[neural correlate]]s for [[emotions]], scientists may be able to use methods like [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scans]] to tell us more about the different ways of being "happy". Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in [[positive emotions]]. He found that the left prefrontal [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative [[emotion]]s as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luz A, Dunne J, Davidson R | year = 2007 | chapter = Meditation and the neuroscience of consciousness | veditors = In Zelazo P, Moscovitch M, Thompson E | title = Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that our [[brain]] can change throughout our lives as a result of our experiences; this is known as [[neuroplasticity]].

The evolutionary perspective offers an alternative approach to understanding happiness and quality of life. Key guiding questions are: What features are included in the brain that allow humans to distinguish between positive and negative states of mind? How do these features improve humans' ability to survive and reproduce? The evolutionary perspective claims that the answers to these questions point towards an understanding of what happiness is about and how to best exploit the capacities of the brain with which humans are endowed. This perspective is presented formally and in detail by the evolutionary biologist [[Bjørn Grinde]] in his book ''[[Darwinian Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grinde | first = Bjørn | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Happiness in the perspective of evolutionary psychology | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 3 | pages = 331–354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021894227295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal factors ==

=== In relation with age ===

==== In adolescence ====
There has been a significant focus in past research on adulthood, in regards to well-being and development and although eudaimonia is not a new field of study, there has been little research done in the areas of adolescence and youth. Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects than well-being, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e. drug and alcohol use).

Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage. Adolescents rapidly face cognitive, social and physical changes, making them prime subjects to study for development and well-being. The ''eudaimonic identity theory'' was used in their research to examine the development of identity through self-discovery and self-realization. They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing one's “''daimon''” ([[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one's true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coatsworth JD, Sharp EH | title = The best within us: Positive psychology perspectives on eudaimonia | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychological Association | location  = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Researchers focused their studies on PYD ([[positive youth development]]) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of three developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.

They determined that adolescents sample multiple ''self-defining activities''; these activities aid in identity formation, as individuals choose activities that they believe represents who they are. These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent's social environments. For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.

''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman AS |title=Two conceptions of happiness: Contrasts of personal expressiveness (eudaimonia) and hedonic enjoyment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=4|pages=678–691|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment. Adolescents recognize their passions, abilities and talents and aim to fulfill their goals and behave in a way that appeases their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

The study on adolescents was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes. Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|254}} Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct the study. Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on. The PEAQ asked adolescents to self-report on activities they participate in and describe themselves with ''self-defining activities''.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|260}} It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains, as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves. The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being. They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, they have a clearer image of themselves, of what they want to achieve and higher wellness. ''Goal-setting'' was found to be a unique predictor; when adolescents work towards goals set by themselves and accomplish them, they are likely to have a clearer emerging identity and higher well-being. Researchers found that more adolescents were happy when they were involved in self-chosen activities because the activities were chosen in line with their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|257–259}}

==== In midlife ====
The [[midlife crisis]] may mark the first reliable drop in happiness during an average human's life. Evidence suggests most people generally become happier with age, with the exception of the years 40 – 50, which is the typical age at which a ''crisis'' might occur. Researchers specify that people in both their 20s and 70s are happier than during midlife, although the extent of happiness changes at different rates. For example, feelings of stress and anger tend to decline after age 20, worrying drops after age 50, and enjoyment very slowly declines in adulthood but finally starts to rise after age 50.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says.

Well-being in late life is more likely to be related to other contextual factors including proximity to death.&lt;ref name=pmid18605841&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Estabrook R, Schupp J, Wagner GG, Lindenberger U | title = Life satisfaction shows terminal decline in old age: longitudinal evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1148–59 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605841 | pmc = 3551350 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18361663&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Röcke C, Lindenberger U, Smith J | title = Decline in life satisfaction in old age: longitudinal evidence for links to distance-to-death | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–68 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18361663 | pmc = 3482430 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.23.1.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of this terminal decline in well-being could be attributed to other changes in age-normative functional declines including physical health and function.&lt;ref name=pmid24660795&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Mitchell P, Shaw J, Anstey KJ | title = Trajectories of terminal decline in the well-being of older women: the DYNOPTA project | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–56 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24660795 | doi = 10.1037/a0035370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is growing debate that assumptions that a single population estimate of age-related changes in well-being truly reflects the lived experiences of older adults has been questioned. The use of growth mixture modelling frameworks has allowed researchers to identify homogenous groups of individuals who are more similar to each other than the population based on their level and change in well-being and has shown that most report stable well-being in their late life and in the decade prior to death.&lt;ref name=pmid25108532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Byles J, Magliano DJ, Mitchell P, Anstey KJ | title = The utility of estimating population-level trajectories of terminal wellbeing decline within a growth mixture modelling framework | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–87 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25108532 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-014-0948-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are based on decades of data, and control for cohort groups; the data avoids the risk that the drops in happiness during midlife are due to populations' unique midlife experiences, like a war. The studies have also controlled for income, job status and parenting (as opposed to [[childlessness]]) to try to isolate the effects of age.

Researchers found support for the notion of age changes inside the individual that affect happiness.
This could be for any number of reasons. Psychological factors could include greater awareness of one's self and preferences; an ability to control desires and have more realistic expectations – unrealistic expectations tend to foster unhappiness; moving closer to death may motivate people to pursue personal goals; improved social skills, like forgiveness, may take years to develop – the practice of forgiveness seems linked to higher levels of happiness; or happier people may live longer and are slightly overrepresented in the elderly population. Age-related chemical changes might also play a role.&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas  | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-05-31 |access-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EcoAgeHap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17722567 |title=Age and happiness: The U-bend of life|publisher=The Economist |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found older individuals reported more health problems, but fewer problems overall. Young adults reported more anger, anxiety, depression, financial problems, troubled relationships and career stress. Researchers also suggest depression in the elderly is often due largely to passivity and inaction – they recommend people continue to undertake activities that bring happiness, even in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity restriction model of depressed affect suggests that stressors that disrupt traditional activities of daily life can lead to a decrease in mental health. The elderly population is vulnerable to activity restriction because of the disabling factors related to age. Increases in scheduled activity as well as social support can decrease the chances of activity restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with depression and languishing ===
A study by Keyes found that there are major costs of depression, which 14% of adults experience annually: it impairs social roles; it costs billions each year due to work absenteeism, diminished [[productivity]], and [[healthcare]] costs; finally, depression accounts for at least one-third of [[suicides]]. Therefore, it is important to study flourishing to learn about what is possible if issues such as depression are tackled and how the ramifications of focusing on the positive make life better not just for one person, but also for others around them.&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002" /&gt;

Flourishing has significant positive aspects magnified when compared to languishing adults and when languishing adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, languishing adults have the same amount of chronic [[disease]] as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better [[physical health]]. Languishing adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit [[Physician|doctors]] and [[therapists]] more than depressed adults.&lt;ref name="(2001).

==== Positive psychology interventions (PPI) in patients ====
A [[Strength-based practice|strengths-based approach]] to personal positive change aims to have clinical psychology place an equal weight on both positive and negative functioning when attempting to understand and treat distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth AL, Steen TA, Seligman ME | title = Positive psychology in clinical practice | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 629–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale is based on empirical findings. Because positive characteristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder the exclusive study of negative life events could produce misleading results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LH, McGowan J, Fooskas S, Rose S | title = Positive life events and social support and the relationship between life stress and psychological disorder | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–87 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6496413 | doi = 10.1007/BF00897213 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n2527h6pr72571x1/ | doi-broken-date = 2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, psychologists are looking to use positive psychology to treat patients. Amy Krentzman, among the others, discussed positive intervention as a way to treat patients. She defined positive intervention as a therapy or activity primarily aimed at increasing positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions, as opposed to focusing on negative thoughts or dysfunctional behaviors. A way of using positive intervention as a clinical treatment is to use positive activity interventions. Positive activity interventions, or PAIs, are brief self-administered exercises that promote positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Two widely used PAIs are “Three Good Things” and “Best Future Self.” “Three Good Things” requires a patient to daily document, for a week, three events that went well during the day, and the respective cause, or causes (this exercise can be modified with counterfactual thinking, that is, adding the imagination of things had them been worse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?dq=gratitude+counterfactual&amp;ei=YB2eVeC2I8Ll8AXNjYfoCA&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Qz4nhZ3ZMmgC&amp;lpg=PA332&amp;ots=CGH8m_Ee_j&amp;pg=PA332&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pSTwZDyMo3_feDWFMeADTsaiWDY&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=The Psychology of Gratitude|first1=Robert A.|last1=Emmons|first2=Michael E.|last2=McCullough | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 February 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;). “Best Future Self” has a patient “think about their life in the future, and imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. They have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of their life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of their life dreams.” The patient is then asked to write down what they imagined. These positive interventions have been shown to decrease depression,&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolier L, Haverman M, Westerhof GJ, Riper H, Smit F, Bohlmeijer E | title = Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 119 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23390882 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interventions focusing on strengths and positive emotions can, in fact, be as effective in treating disorder as other more commonly used approaches such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Steen TA, Park N, Peterson C | title = Positive psychology progress: empirical validation of interventions | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16045394 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin NL, Lyubomirsky S | title = Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 467–87 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19301241 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20593 | url = http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf | access-date = 2017-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164432/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf# | archive-date = 2012-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the apparent effect of PPIs cannot be caused by [[publication bias]], according to a [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies (2009). PPIs studied included producing gratitude letters, performing optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with people.&lt;ref name=Sin2009 /&gt;

Also, in a newer meta-analysis (39 studies, 6,139 participants, 2012), the [[standardized mean difference]] was 0.34 higher for subjective well-being, 0.20 for psychological well-being and 0.23 for depression. Three to six months after the intervention, the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant, so effects seem fairly sustainable. However, in high-quality studies the positive effect was weaker, though positive, so authors considered further high-quality studies necessary to strengthen the evidence. They claimed that the above-mentioned meta-analysis (2009) did not put enough weight on the quality of studies.
PPIs found positive included blessings, kindness practices, taking personal goals, and showing gratitude.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The interventions called "Gratitude Journaling" and "Three Good Things" seem to operate via gratitude.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt; There is evidence that, when gratitude journaling, focussing on quality over quantity as well as people more than possessions, yields greater benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal|title=Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a diminished effect from gratitude journaling if it is done more than once or twice a week. Journaling sans gratitude is effective in decreasing negative emotions in general, which suggests that the act of journaling, rather than gratitude alone, is involved in the treatment effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/romantic-relationships.aspx|title=Breakups aren't all bad: Coping strategies to promote positive outcomes|website=www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology seeks to inform clinical psychology of the potential to expand its approach, and of the merit of the possibilities. Given a fair opportunity, positive psychology might well change priorities to better address the breadth and depth of the human experience in clinical settings.

==== Post-traumatic growth ====
[[Posttraumatic growth]] (PTG) is a possible outcome after a traumatic event, besides [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Following a traumatic event, for instance rape, incest, cancer, attack, or combat, "it is normal to experience debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Reivich K, Shatte A |year=2003|title=The Resilience Factor: Seven Essential Skills For Overcoming Life's Inevitable Obstacles|publisher=Three Rivers Press|edition=Reprint|pages=9–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who shows PTG however, will experience these negative outcomes for a time and then show an increase in well-being, higher than it was before the trauma occurred. [[Martin Seligman]], a founder of positive psychology, emphasizes that "arriving at a higher level of psychological functioning than before" is a key point in PTG.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME |year=2011|title=Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and wellbeing|location=New York, NY|publisher=Free Press|chapter=Ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead an individual experiences a depressive period but recovers from an incident and returns to their normal level of psychological functioning, they are demonstrating [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; This suggests that in PTG, the trauma acts as a turning point for the person to achieve greater well-being. Seligman recognizes "the fact that trauma often sets the stage for growth" and given the right tools, individuals can make the most of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

When reflecting on a traumatic growth, Seligman suggests using the following five elements to facilitate PTG: understand the response to trauma, reduce anxiety, utilize constructive disclosure, create a trauma narrative, and articulate life principles and stances that are more robust to challenge.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; Someone experiencing PTG will achieve elements of Seligman’s "good life" theory, including a more meaningful and purposeful valuing of life, improved positive relationships, accomplishment, and a more optimistic and open mindset according to the [[Broaden-and-build|broaden-and-build theory]].&lt;ref name="pmid8827649"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tedeschi RG, Calhoun LG | title = The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: measuring the positive legacy of trauma | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–71 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8827649 | doi = 10.1002/jts.2490090305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-traumatic growth in constructive journalism ====
The phenomenon of PTG is applicable to many disciplines. The construct is important not only for just soldiers, emergency responders, and survivors of traumatic events, but on average, for everyday citizens facing typical adversity. One way to expose citizens to stories of PTG is through constructive journalism. Constructive journalism, as defined by PhD student Karen McIntyre at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, is "an emerging style of journalism in which positive psychology techniques are applied to news work with the aim of engaging readers by creating more productive news stories, all while maintaining core journalistic functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McIntyre K |year=2014|title=My current research focus is the subject of my dissertation: constructive journalism|url=http://karenmcintyre.org/research-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathrine Gyldensted, an experienced reporter with a Masters in applied positive psychology and coauthor of two books, demonstrated that typical news reporting, which is associated with negative valence, harms mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Gyldensted C |year=2011|title= Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology|type=Master Thesis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using PTG to focus on victims' strengths and instances of overcoming adversity encourages readers to implement similar ideals in their own lives. "So the goal of positive psychology in well-being theory is to measure and to build human flourishing."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011" /&gt; Combining positive psychology constructs like PTG, PERMA, and "broaden and build" with journalism could potentially improve affect and inspire individuals about the benefits of positive psychology.

PERMA not only plays a role in our own personal lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists ask the right questions to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/cathrine-gyldensted/2013072426851|title=Hurricane Sandy, Utoya, Homelessness: Constructive News out of Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affect - ratio of positive to negative affect ====
Fredrickson and Losada postulated in 2005 that the [[ratio]] of positive to negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], known as the [[critical positivity ratio]], can distinguish [[individual]]s that flourish from those that do not. Languishing was characterized by a ratio of positive to negative affect of 2.5. Optimal functioning or flourishing was argued to occur at a ratio of 4.3. The point at which flourishing changes to languishing is called the [[Losada line]] and is placed at the positivity ratio of 2.9. Those with higher ratios were claimed to have broader behavioral repertoires, greater [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]] and resilience to [[adversity]], more social [[resources]], and more optimal functioning in many areas of their life.&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F."&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678-686.&lt;/ref&gt; The model also predicted the existence of an upper limit to happiness, reached at a positivity ratio of 11.5. Fredrickson and Losada claimed that at this limit, flourishing begins to disintegrate and productivity and creativity decrease. They suggested as positivity increased, so to "appropriate negativity" needs to increase. This was described as time-limited, practicable [[feedback]] connected to specific circumstances, i.e. [[constructive criticism]].&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F." /&gt;

This positivity ratio theory was widely accepted until 2013, when Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, co-authored a paper with [[Alan Sokal]] and Harris Friedman, showing that the mathematical basis of the paper was invalid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855896&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The complex dynamics of wishful thinking: the critical positivity ratio | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 801–13 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855896 | doi = 10.1037/a0032850 | arxiv = 1307.7006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson partially retracted the paper, agreeing that the math may be flawed, but maintaining that the empirical evidence is still valid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855895&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL | title = Updated thinking on positivity ratios | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 814–22 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855895 | doi = 10.1037/a0033584 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and colleagues insist there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pmid25197848&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The persistence of wishful thinking | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–32 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25197848 | doi = 10.1037/a0037050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with basic emotions ===
Most [[psychologist]]s focus on a person's most basic [[List of emotions|emotions]]. There are thought to be between seven and fifteen basic [[emotion]]s. The [[emotion]]s can be combined in many ways to create more subtle variations of [[emotional]] experience. This suggests that any attempt to wholly eliminate negative emotions from our life would have the unintended consequence of losing the variety and subtlety of our most profound emotional experiences. Efforts to increase positive emotions will not automatically result in decreased negative [[emotion]]s, nor will decreased negative emotions necessarily result in increased positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmack, U. (2005). The structure of subjective well-being. In M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen (Eds.) The science of subjective well-being. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, pp. 97–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Feldman Barrett (1992) described emotional reactions as core affects, which are primitive emotional reactions that are consistently experienced but often not acknowledged; they blend pleasant and unpleasant as well as activated and deactivated dimensions that we carry with us at an almost unconscious level.&lt;ref name=pmid10353204&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JA, Barrett LF | title = Core affect, prototypical emotional episodes, and other things called emotion: dissecting the elephant | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–19 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353204 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests negative emotions can be damaging. In an article titled "The undoing effect of positive emotions", [[Barbara Fredrickson]] et al. hypothesized positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], they show increased [[heart rate]], higher [[blood sugar]], [[immune suppression]], and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If unregulated, the prolonged physiological activation can lead to illness, [[coronary heart disease]], and heightened mortality. Both lab and survey research substantiate that positive emotions help people under stress to return to a preferable, healthier physiological baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Mancuso RA, Branigan C, Tugade MM | title = The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotions | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–258 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 21731120 | pmc = 3128334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that improved mood is one of the various benefits of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise?

==== Behavioral repertoire ====
The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. [[happiness]], [[Interest (emotion)|interest]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]])&lt;ref name="IPP2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Compton|first=William C | name-list-format = vanc |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|year=2005|pages=23–40|chapter=2|isbn=0-534-64453-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of [[anxiety]] leads to the specific [[fight-or-flight response]] for immediate survival.&lt;ref name="IPP2"/&gt;

==== Elevation ====
After several years of researching [[disgust]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], and others, studied its opposite; the term "elevation" was coined. Elevation is a pleasant moral emotion, involving a desire to act morally and do "good". As an emotion it has a biological basis, and is sometimes characterized by a feeling of expansion in the chest or a tingling feeling on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Haidt|Haidt, Jonathan]] (2005). ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis]]''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2003). [http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.elevation-and-positive-psychology.manuscript.html Elevation and the positive psychology of morality]. In C. L. M. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (Eds.) ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. (pp.&amp;nbsp;275–289).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The concept of "flourishing" ===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

The term flourishing, in positive psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and [[psychological resilience|resilience]] (Fredrickson, 2005).&lt;ref name=pmid16221001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Losada MF | title = Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 678–86 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16221001 | pmc = 3126111 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness is made up of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth involves the use of personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life. Those who languish experience more emotional pain, psychosocial deficiency, restrictions in regular activities, and missed workdays.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; 
	
Fredrickson &amp; Losada (2005) conducted a study on university students, operationalizing positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Based on a mathematical model which has been strongly criticized,&lt;ref name=pmid23855896/&gt; and now been formally withdrawn by Fredrickson as invalid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0034435 |title='Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing': Correction to Fredrickson and Losada (2005) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=9 |page=822 |year=2013 |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L |last2=Losada |first2=Marcial F | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson &amp; Losada claimed to have discovered a [[critical positivity ratio]], above which people would flourish and below which they would not. Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). [http://www.unc.edu/peplab/publications/Fredrickson%202013%20Updated%20Thinking.pdf Updated thinking on positivity ratios]. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and [[Alan Sokal]] has pointed out that "given [Fredrickson and Losada's] experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between "flourishing" and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/fredrickson-losada-positivity-ratio-paper-partially-withdrawn/|title=Fredrickson-Losada "positivity ratio" paper partially withdrawn|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study surveyed a U.S. sample of 3,032 adults, aged 25–74. Results showed 17.2 percent of adults were flourishing, while 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy. Some common characteristics of a flourishing adult included: educated, older, married and wealthy. The study findings suggest there is room for adults to improve as less than 20 percent of Americans are living a flourishing life. (Keyes, 2002).&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | year = 2002 | title = The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life | url = | journal = Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 207–222 | doi=10.2307/3090197| jstor = 3090197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits from living a flourishing life emerge from research on the effects of experiencing a high ratio of positive to negative affect. The studied benefits of positive affect are increased responsiveness, "broadened behavioral repertoires", increased instinct, and increased perception and imagination.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; In addition, the good feelings associated with flourishing result in improvements to immune system functioning, cardiovascular recovery, lessened effects of negative affect, and frontal brain asymmetry.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Other benefits to those of moderate mental health or moderate levels of flourishing were: stronger psychological and social performance, high resiliency, greater cardiovascular health, and an overall healthier lifestyle (Keyes, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | title = Promoting and protecting mental health as flourishing: a complementary strategy for improving national mental health | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–108 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17324035 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.2.95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encountered benefits of flourishing suggest a definition: "[flourishing] people experience high levels of emotional, psychological and social well being due to vigor and vitality, self-determination, continuous self- growth, close relationships and a meaningful and purposeful life" (Siang-Yang, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siang-Yang | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = Applied Positive Psychology: Putting Positive Psychology into Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology &amp; Christianity | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
==== Happiness measurement ====
===== Oxford Happiness Questionnaire =====
Psychologists Peter Hills and [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] developed the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/ Oxford Happiness Questionnaire] by Michael Argyle and Peter Hills, a survey of current level of happiness. See also discussion in Hills, P., &amp; Argyle, M. (2002). The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire: a compact scale for the measurement of psychological well-being. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 33, 1073–1082.&lt;/ref&gt; as a broad measure of psychological well-being. The approach was criticized for lacking a theoretical model of happiness and for overlapping too much with related concepts such as [[self-esteem]], sense of purpose, social interest, [[kindness]], sense of [[humor]] and aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Todd B. | last = Kashdan | url = http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/happy.PDF | title = The assessment of subjective well-being (issues raised by the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2004 | pages = 1225–1232 | volume = 36 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00213-7 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Satisfaction with Life Scale =====
"Happiness" encompasses different emotional and mental phenomena. One method of assessment is [[Ed Diener]]'s Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to Diener, this five-question survey corresponds well with impressions from friends and family, and low incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Rather than long-term, big picture appraisals, some methods attempt to identify the amount of positive affect from one activity to the next. Scientists use beepers to remind volunteers to write down the details of their current situation. Alternatively, volunteers complete detailed diary entries each morning about the day before.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; A discrepancy arises when researchers compare the results of these short-term "experience sampling" methods, with long-term appraisals. Namely, the latter may not be very accurate; people may not know what makes their life pleasant from one moment to the next. For instance, parents' appraisals mention their children as sources of pleasure, while "experience sampling" indicates parents were not enjoying caring for their children, compared to other activities.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html |title=Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains this discrepancy by differentiating between happiness according to the "experiencing self" compared to the "remembering self": when asked to reflect on experiences, [[List of memory biases|memory biases]] like the Peak-End effect (e.g. we mostly remember the dramatic parts of a vacation, and how it was at the end) play a large role. A striking finding was in a study of [[colonoscopy]] patients. Adding 60 seconds to this invasive procedure, Kahneman found participants reported the colonoscopy as ''more'' pleasant. This was attributed to making sure the colonoscopy instrument was not moved during the extra 60 seconds – movement is the source of the most discomfort. Thus, Kahneman was appealing to the remembering self's tendency to focus on the end of the experience. Such findings help explain human error in [[affective forecasting]] – people's ability to predict their future emotional states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Humphrey Devereux by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|upright|The "remembering self" may not be the best source of information for pleasing the "experiencing self".]]

==== Changes in happiness levels ====
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Humans exhibit a variety of abilities. This includes an ability of emotional ''Hedonic Adaptation'', an idea suggesting that beauty, fame and money do not generally have lasting effects on happiness (this effect has also been called the [[Hedonic treadmill]]). In this vein, some research has suggested that only recent events, meaning those that occurred within the last 3 months, affect happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh E, Diener E, Fujita F | title = Events and subjective well-being: only recent events matter | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–102 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8656337 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency to adapt, and therefore return to an earlier level of happiness, is illustrated by studies showing lottery winners are no happier in the years after they've won.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other studies have shown [[Paraplegia|paraplegics]] are nearly as happy as control groups that are not paralyzed,&lt;ref name=Seligman2002&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Seligman | first1 = Martin E. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Martin Seligman|title = Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment | year = 2002 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-2297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; after equally few years. Daniel Kahneman explains: "they are not paraplegic full time... It has to do with allocation of attention". Thus, contrary to our [[impact bias]]es, lotteries and paraplegia do not change experiences to as great a degree as we would believe.

However, in a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref name=jgao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner J, Oswald AJ | title = Money and mental wellbeing: a longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16949692 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, adaptation can be a very slow and incomplete process. Distracting life changes such as the death of a spouse or losing one's job can show measurable changes in happiness levels for several years.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Even the "adapted" paraplegics mentioned above did ultimately report lower levels of pleasure (again, they were happier than one would expect, but not fully adapted).&lt;ref name=Diener&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/significant-results/201304/5-myths-positive-psychology|title=5 Myths of Positive Psychology| first = Robert | last = Biswas-Diener | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, adaptation is a complex process, and while it ''does'' mitigate the emotional effects of many life events it cannot mitigate them entirely.

===== Happiness set point =====
The happiness set point idea is that most people return to an average level of happiness – or a set point – after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose set points lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful most of the time and those whose set points tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; One reason that subjective well-being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well-being, the general population returns to their set point.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LyubomirskyHappiness.jpg|thumb|right|In the recipe for one person's happiness, it is nonsensical to blame one ingredient (because all are necessary). However, when comparing two people's happiness, ingredients like genetics can account for as much as half the difference.]]
In her book ''[[The How of Happiness]]'', [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] similarly argued people's happiness varies around a genetic set point. [[Robert Biswas-Diener|Diener]] warns, however, that it is nonsensical to claim that "happiness is influenced 30–50% by genetics". Diener explains that the recipe for happiness for an individual always requires genetics, environment, and behaviour too, so it is nonsensical to claim that an individual's happiness is due to only one ingredient.

Only differences in happiness can be attributed to differences in factors. In other words, Lyubomirsky's research does not discuss happiness in one individual; it discusses differences in happiness between two or more people. Specifically, Lyubomirsky suggests that 30–40% of the difference in happiness levels is due to genetics (i.e. [[heritable]]). In other words, still, Diener says it makes no sense to say one person's happiness is "due 50% to genetics", but it does make sense to say one person's difference in happiness is 50% due to differences in their genetics (and the rest is due to behaviour and environment).&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diener/&gt;

Findings from twin studies support the findings just mentioned. Twins reared apart had nearly the same levels of happiness thereby suggesting the environment is not entirely responsible for differences in people's happiness.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; Importantly, an individual's baseline happiness is not ''entirely'' determined by genetics, and not even by early life influences on one's genetics. Whether or not a person manages to elevate their baseline to the heights of their genetic possibilities depends partly on several factors, including actions and habits. Some happiness-boosting habits seem to include gratitude, appreciation, and even altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other research-based habits and techniques for increasing happiness are discussed on this page.

Besides the development of new habits, the use of antidepressants, effective exercise, and a healthier [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] have proven to affect mood significantly. There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faunalytics.org/veganism-help-reduce-stress-anxiety/|title=Does Veganism Help Reduce Stress and Anxiety? - Faunalytics|date=25 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a vegan diet reduces stress and anxiety. [[Exercise]] is sometimes called the "miracle" or "wonder" drug – alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|title=Physical Activity and Exercise: The Wonder Drug|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221329/http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/#|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimlott N | title = The miracle drug | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 407, 409 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20463262 | pmc = 2868602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that a recent book, ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]'', challenges the use of non-conservative usage of medications for mental patients, specially with respect to their long-term positive feedback effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0009/407961/20110706MartinSeligman.mp3|title=Seligman, Martin E.P. (6 July 2011). "Flourish". Royal Society of Arts. audio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation has been found to increase happiness in several studies.A study on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher [[happiness]] (Oxford happiness questionnaire) than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Evidences against the happiness set point theory =====
In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x |jstor=20183166 |title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=2016 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujita and Diener found that 24% of people changed significantly between the first five years of the study and the last five years. Almost one in four people showed changes in their well-being over the years; indeed sometimes those changes were quite dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujita F, Diener E | title = Life satisfaction set point: stability and change | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–64 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631581 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Headey found that 5–6% of people dramatically increased their life satisfaction over a 15- to 20-year period and that the goals people pursued significantly affected their life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headey | first1 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Life goals matter to happiness: A revision of set-point theory | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 312–231 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal training to increase happiness =====
The easiest and best possible way to increase one's happiness is by doing something that increases the ratio of positive to negative emotions. Contrary to some beliefs, in many scenarios, people are actually very good at determining what will increase their positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayer RE, Newman JR, McClain TM | title = Self-regulation of mood: strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 910–25 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7983582 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many techniques developed to help increase one's happiness.

A first technique is known as the "Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM)." This model proposes that long-term happiness is determined upon: (1) one's genetically determined [[#Happiness set point|set-point]], (2) circumstantial factors, and (3) intentional activities. Lyubomirsky, Sheldon and Schkade suggest to make these changes in the correct way in order to have long-term happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, Sheldon KM, Schkade D | year = 2005 | title = Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of how to increase one's happiness is through a procedure called "Hope Training." Hope Training is primarily focused on hope due to the belief that hope drives the positive emotions of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lopez SJ, Floyd RK, Ulven JC, Snyder CR |year=2000|contribution=Hope therapy: Building a house of hope|editor=C.R. Snyder|title=The handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications|pages=123–148|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This training is based on the hope theory, which states that well-being can increase once people have developed goals and believe themselves to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rand, Kevin L., &amp; Cheaven, Jennifer S|year=2009|contribution=Hope theory|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|edition=2nd |editors= Lopez, Shane, J., Snyder, C.R. |location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=323–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of hope training is to eliminate individuals from false hope syndrome. False hope syndrome particularly occurs when one believes that changing their behavior is easy and the outcomes of the change will be evidenced in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00076 |title=The False-Hope Syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=128 |year=2016 |last1=Polivy |first1=Janet |last2=Herman |first2=C. Peter  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coaching procedures based on positive psychology, which are backed by scientific research, with availability of intervention tools and assessments that positive psychology trained coaches can utilize to support the coaching process. Positive psychology coaching uses scientific evidence and insights gained in these areas to work with clients in their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biswas-Diener | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Intervention | isbn = 978-0-470-53676-6|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time and happiness ====
[[File:Slavyansky-Family portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait commemorating a family's day together]]
[[Philip Zimbardo]] suggests we might also analyze happiness from a "time perspective". He suggested the sorting of people's focus in life by valence (positive or negative) and also by their time perspective (past, present, or future orientation). Doing so may reveal some individual conflicts, not over whether an activity is enjoyed, but whether one prefers to risk delaying gratification further. Zimbardo also believes research reveals an optimal balance of perspectives for a happy life; commenting, our focus on reliving positive aspects of our past should be high, followed by time spent believing in a positive future, and finally spending a moderate (but not excessive) amount of time in enjoyment of the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time.html |title=Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "flow" ===
In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's started to study ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt; The effect of challenging situations means that flow is often temporarily exciting and variously stressful, but this is considered [[Eustress]], which is also known as "good" stress. Eustress is arguably less harmful than [[chronic stress]], although the pathways of stress-related systems are similar. Both can create a "wear and tear" effect; however, the differing physiological elements and added psychological benefits of eustress might well balance any wear and tear experienced.

Csikszentmihalyi identified nine indicator elements of flow:
1. Clear goals exist every step of the way, 2. Immediate feedback guides one's action, 3. There is a balance between challenges and abilities, 4. Action and awareness are merged, 5. Distractions are excluded from consciousness, 6. Failure is not worrisome, 7. Self-consciousness disappears, 8. Sense of time is distorted, and 9. The activity becomes "[[autotelic]]" (an end in itself, done for its own sake)&lt;ref name="In zone"&gt;{{cite web |title="In the zone": enjoyment, creativity, and the nine elements of "flow" |publisher=MeaningandHappiness.com|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/zone-enjoyment-creativity-elements-flow/26/|access-date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies also show that flow is greater during work while happiness is greater during leisure activities.&lt;ref name="Lopez, S. J. 2009. p. 200"&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

==== Addiction ====
Arguably, some people pursue ineffective shortcuts to feeling good. These shortcuts create positive feelings, but are problematic, in part because of the lack of effort involved. Some examples of these shortcuts include shopping, drugs, chocolate, loveless sex, and TV. These are problematic pursuits because all of these examples have the ability to become addictive. When happiness comes to us so easily, it comes with a price we may not realize. This price comes when taking these shortcuts is the only way to become happy, otherwise viewed as an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krentzman AR | title = Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22985057 | pmc = 3531570 | doi = 10.1037/a0029897 }} (Date is for advance online publication. The final form was published in March 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Amy Krentzman on the Application of Positive Psychology to Substance Use, Addiction, and Recovery Research, identified, in the field of positive psychology, three domains that allow an individual to thrive and contribute to society.

One of these, A Pleasant Life, involves good feelings about the past, present, and future. To tie this with addiction, they chose an example of [[alcoholism]]. Research on positive affect and alcohol showed a majority of the population associates drinking with pleasure. The pleasure one feels from alcohol is known as somatic pleasure, which is immediate but a short lived sensory delight. The researchers wanted to make clear pleasure alone does not amount to a life well lived; there is more to life than pleasure. Secondly, the Engaged Life is associated with positive traits such as strength of character. A few examples of character strength according to ''Character Strength and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification'' by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson (2004) are bravery, integrity, citizenship, humility, prudence, gratitude, and hope, all of which are shown in the rise to recovery. To descend into an addiction shows a lack of character strength; however, rising to recovery shows the reinstatement of character strengths, including the examples mentioned above. Thirdly, the Meaningful Life is service and membership to positive organizations. Examples of positive organizations include family, workplace, social groups, and society in general. Organizations, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], can be viewed as a positive organization. Membership fosters positive affect, while also promoting character strengths, which as seen in the Engaged Life, can aid in beating addiction.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt;

==== Emotional health ====
Researcher Dianne Hales described an ''emotionally healthy'' person as someone who exhibits flexibility and adaptability to different circumstances, a sense of meaning and affirmation in life, an "understanding that the self is not the center of the universe", compassion and the ability to be unselfish, an increased depth and satisfaction in intimate relationships, and a sense of control over the mind and body.&lt;ref name=twsMay18&gt;{{cite news | first = Dianne | last = Hales | name-list-format = vanc  |title= An Invitation to Health, Brief: Psychological Well-Being 2010–2011 Edition | publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning  |page=26 |year= 2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health ====
[[Richard Layard|Layard]] and others show that the most important influence on happiness is mental health.&lt;ref name="voxeu1"/&gt;

L.M. Keyes and Shane Lopez illustrate the four typologies of mental health functioning: flourishing, struggling, floundering and languishing. However, complete mental health is a combination of high emotional well-being, high psychological well-being, and high social well-being, along with low mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, C.L.M., &amp; Lopez, S.J. (2002). Toward a science of mental health: Positive directions in diagnosis and interventions. In C.R. Snyder &amp; S.J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 45–59). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health is part of well-being, some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, Snippe E, de Jonge P, Jeronimus BF | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150867 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26963923 | pmc = 4786317 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1150867B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical health ====
Meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2017 show that exercise is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, fatigue and QoL plus improvements in attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, social functioning, schizophrenic symptoms, and verbal fluency in various special populations. However, aerobic exercise has no significant effect on anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kspope.com/ethics/exercise-meta-analyses.php|title=Meta-Analyses: Exercise's Psychological &amp; Physical Effects on Health, Disorders, &amp; Quality of Life|website=kspope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study conducted by Andrew Steptow and Michael Marmot at University College London, found that happiness is related to biological markers that play an important role in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steptoe A, Wardle J, Marmot M | title = Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 18 | pages = 6508–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840727 | pmc = 1088362 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409174102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6508S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers aimed to analyze whether there was any association between well-being and three biological markers: heart rate, [[cortisol]] levels, and plasma fibrinogen levels. The participants who rated themselves the least happy had cortisol levels that were 48% higher than those who rated themselves as the most happy. The least happy subjects also had a large plasma fibrinogen response to two stress-inducing tasks: the Stroop test, and tracing a star seen in a mirror image. Repeating their studies three years later Steptow and Marmot found that participants who scored high in positive emotion continued to have lower levels of cortisol and fibrinogen, as well as a lower heart rate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Happy People Live Longer (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frey BS | title = Psychology. Happy people live longer | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6017 | pages = 542–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21292959 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201060 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Frey reported that happy people live 14% longer, increasing longevity 7.5 to 10 years and [[Richard Davidson]]'s bestseller (2012) ''The Emotional Life of Your Brain'' argues that positive emotion and happiness benefit long-term health.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, in 2015 a study building on earlier research found that happiness has no effect on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Floud S, Pirie K, Green J, Peto R, Beral V | title = Does happiness itself directly affect mortality?

Happiness does however seem to have a protective impact on immunity. The tendency to experience positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to [[Common cold|colds]] and [[Influenza|flu]] in interventional studies irrespective of other factors such as smoking, drinking, exercise, and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Doyle WJ, Turner RB, Alper CM, Skoner DP | title = Emotional style and susceptibility to the common cold | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 652–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12883117 | doi = 10.1097/01.PSY.0000077508.57784.DA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Alper CM, Doyle WJ, Treanor JJ, Turner RB | title = Positive emotional style predicts resistance to illness after experimental exposure to rhinovirus or influenza a virus | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17101814 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000245867.92364.3c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive emotional states have a favorable effect on mortality and survival in both healthy and diseased populations.

==== Alternative medicine ====
Health consumers sometimes confuse the terms "wellness" and "well-being". Wellness is a term more commonly associated with alternative medicine which may or may not coincide with gains in subjective well-being. In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/australian-government-response-review-medicines-and-medical-devices-regulation|title=Australian Government Response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation| publisher = Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods Administration|date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government reviewed the effectiveness of numerous complementary therapies: they found low-moderate quality evidence that the Alexander technique, Buteyko, massage therapy (remedial massage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.org.au/downloads/submissions/Evidence-Based-Massage-2009.pdf |title=Evidence based massage |website=www.amt.org.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), tai chi and yoga are helpful for certain health conditions. On the other hand, the balance of evidence indicates that homeopathy, aromatherapy, bowen therapy, Feldenkrais, herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, pilates, reflexology and rolfing shiatsu were classed as ineffective.

==== Fruit and vegetable consumption ====
There is growing evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is related to greater happiness, life satisfaction, and positive mood as well. This evidence cannot be entirely explained by demographic or health variables including [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[smoking]], and [[body mass index]], suggesting a causal link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner TS, Brookie KL, Richardson AC, Polak MA | title = On carrots and curiosity: eating fruit and vegetables is associated with greater flourishing in daily life | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 413–27 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25080035 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have found that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than normal, and they also felt more positive the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White BA, Horwath CC, Conner TS | title = Many apples a day keep the blues away--daily experiences of negative and positive affect and food consumption in young adults | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–98 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23347122 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-sectional study|Cross-sectional studies]] worldwide support a relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day have a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy,” suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rooney C, McKinley MC, Woodside JV | title = The potential role of fruit and vegetables in aspects of psychological well-being: a review of the literature and future directions | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 420–32 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24020691 | doi = 10.1017/S0029665113003388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kye SY, Park K | title = Health-related determinants of happiness in Korean adults | journal = International Journal of Public Health | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 731–8 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25033934 | doi = 10.1007/s00038-014-0588-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fararouei M, Brown IJ, Akbartabar Toori M, Estakhrian Haghighi R, Jafari J | title = Happiness and health behaviour in Iranian adolescent girls | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1187–92 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24215965 | doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piqueras JA, Kuhne W, Vera-Villarroel P, van Straten A, Cuijpers P | title = Happiness and health behaviours in Chilean college students: a cross-sectional survey | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 443 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21649907 | pmc = 3125376 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-11-443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Williams DR, Rimm EB, Ryff C, Kubzansky LD | title = Association between optimism and serum antioxidants in the midlife in the United States study | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–10 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23257932 | pmc = 3539819 | doi = 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31827c08a9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchflower |first1=David G. |last2=Oswald |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Stewart-Brown |first3=Sarah  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Is Psychological Well-Being Linked to the Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables? |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=114 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=785–801 |doi=10.1007/s11205-012-0173-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; greater fruit and vegetable consumption had a positive association with greater happiness, independent of factors such as [[smoking]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[body mass index]], and [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic factors]].

The documentary ‘food matters’ includes claims of well-being benefits of raw foods, which has been disputed as pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1i.shtml |title=Digestive Leukocytosis-What a Close Reading of Kouchakoff Reveals |publisher=Beyondveg.com |date= |access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedonic well-being ===
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z |title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=17 |issue=5 |page=2023 |year=2015 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joshanloo M | title = A New Look at the Factor Structure of the MHC-SF in Iran and the United States Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26990960 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity ===
Individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being. Not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being, it also improves psychological health.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=Peggy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Identity Structures and Psychological Well-Being: Gender and Marital Status Comparisons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 1992|volume=55|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.2307/2786794|jstor=2786794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles, therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being. Each individual role is ranked internally within a [[hierarchy]] of salience. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity”.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"/&gt;

Different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being. Within this hierarchy, higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being.

[[Ethnic Group|Ethnic identity]] may play a role in an individual's cognitive well-being. Studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong, secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to [[cognitive]] well-being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phinney | first1 = Jean S. | last2 = Horenczyk | first2 = Gabriel | last3 = Liebkind | first3 = Karmela | last4 = Vedder | first4 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethnic Identity, Immigration, and Well-Being: An Interactional Perspective | journal = Journal of Social Issues |date=September 2001|volume=57|issue=3|pages=493–510|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture, therefore experiencing increased well-being.

=== Optimism and helplessness ===
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[J.B. MacKinnon]] recommended taking full responsibility for one small, but clear improvement for the world (the way energy-saving activists did by promoting a new kind of lamp). Inspired by sociological research, MacKinnon said "vertical agitation" helps reduce feelings of helplessness.]]

[[Learned optimism]] refers to development of one's potential for a [[sanguine]] outlook.{{clarify|date=May 2018}} Optimism is learned as personal efforts and abilities are linked to personally desired outcomes. In short, it is the belief one can influence the future in tangible and meaningful ways. Learned optimism contrasts with [[learned helplessness]], which consists of a belief, or beliefs, one has no control over what occurs, and that something external dictates outcomes, e.g., success. Optimism is learned by consciously challenging negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]]. This includes self talk on any event viewed as a personal failure that permanently affects all areas of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004 |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=54 |issue=7 |page=821 |year=2013 |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrapersonal, or internal, dialogues influence one's feelings. In fact, reports of happiness are correlated with the general ability to "rationalize or explain" social and economic inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conservatives Happier Than Liberals | first = Jeanna
 | last = Bryner | name-list-format = vanc |work=LiveScience.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080507-liberal-conservative.html|access-date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hope]] is a powerful positive feeling, linked to a learned style of goal-directed thinking. Hope is fostered when a person utilizes both ''pathways thinking'' (the perceived capacity to find routes to desired goals) and ''agency thinking'' (the requisite motivations to use those routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Snyder CR | year = 2000 | title = Handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[J.B. MacKinnon]] suggested the cognitive tool of "Vertical Agitation" can assist in avoiding helplessness (e.g., paralysis in the face of Earth's many problems). The concept stemmed from research on denial by sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]. Cohen explained: in the face of massive problems people tend towards learned helplessness rather than confronting the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] facts of the matter. Vertical Agitation involves focusing on one part of a problem at a time, while holding oneself accountable for solving the problem – all the way to the highest level of government, business and society (such as advocating strongly for something: [[Compact fluorescent lamp|eco-friendly lightbulbs]]). This allows each individual in society to make vital "trivial" (read: small) changes, without being intimidated by the work needed to be done as a whole. Mackinnon added: a piecemeal approach also keeps individuals from becoming too 'holier than thou' (harassing friends and family about ''every'' possible improvement), where widespread practice of Vertical Agitation would lead to much improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/Eco-Uncertainty-JB-MacKinnon-Explore.aspx |title=In an Age of Eco-Uncertainty: Vertical Agitation, Eco-Douchebags, Cohen' s Rule, and Lifestyle as Social Change |publisher=Utne.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal finances ===

It has been argued that money cannot effectively "buy" much happiness unless it is used in certain ways, and that "Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house themselves, having more money – even a lot more money – makes them only a little bit happier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett|first1=Drake | name-list-format = vanc | title = Happiness: A buyer’s guide | url = http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/23/happiness_a_buyers_guide/ |access-date=1 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=23 August 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'', psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] described research suggesting money makes a significant difference to the poor (where basic needs are not yet met), but has a greatly diminished effect once one reaches middle class (i.e. the [[Easterlin paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin RA, McVey LA, Switek M, Sawangfa O, Zweig JS | title = The happiness-income paradox revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 52 | pages = 22463–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21149705 | pmc = 3012515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015962107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10722463E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every dollar earned is just as valuable to happiness up to a $75,000 annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/|title=Everything you need to know about whether money makes you happy - 80,000 Hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereafter, the value of each additional dollar earns a diminishing amount of happiness.

People overestimate the influence of wealth by 100%.&lt;ref name=Aknin09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17439760903271421 |title=From wealth to well-being?

Professor of Economics [[Richard Easterlin]] noted that [[job satisfaction]] does not depend on salary. In other words, having extra money for luxuries does not increase happiness as much as enjoying one's job or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin R |year=2008|title=Income and happiness: towards a unified theory|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=11|issue=473|pages=465–484|doi= 10.1111/1468-0297.00646|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/easterlin2001a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert is thus adamant, people should go to great lengths to figure out which jobs they would enjoy, and to find a way to do one of those jobs for a living (that is, provided one is also attentive to social ties).

Unemployment is detrimental to individual well-being. However, that does not hold true in countries where unemployment is widespread. Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201110/preserving-mental-health-during-unemployment|title=Preserving Mental Health During Unemployment|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the impact of unemployment is dampened in those for whom work is less central to their identity, those who receive less criticism and less negative judgments from others, those who can meet their immediate financial obligations and those who do not see their unemployment as high stress and negative. Other protective factors include the expectation of reemployment, routines that structure one's time and evaluating oneself as worthy, competent and successful. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, unemployment is worse for wellbeing for those that are right wing or live in high income countries. Not all unemployment is bad, however: international data from sixteen Western countries indicates that retirement at any age yields large increases in subjective well-being that returns to trend by age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2|title=Subjective Well-Being and Retirement: Analysis and Policy Recommendations | first = Elizabeth Mokyr | last = Horner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=125–144|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive coaching, a workplace intervention for well-being and performance, is proven to work in certain contexts, according to a 2013 independent quantitative scientific summary synthesising high quality scientific research on coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadingchangenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Structuring-and-Understanding-the-Coaching-Industry.pdf |title=Structure and understanding |website=leadingchangenetwork.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that standard effect sizes for the outcomes of performance/skills, well-being, coping, goal-attainment and work/career attitudes range from 0.43 to 0.74.

A more recent study has challenged the [[Easterlin paradox]]. Using recent data from a broader collection of countries, a positive link was found between GDP and well-being; and there was no point at which wealthier countries' subjective well-being ceased to increase. It was concluded economic growth does indeed increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stevenson, B., Wolfers, J.|year=2008|title=Economic growth and subjective well-being: Reassessing the Easterlin paradox|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–102|doi=10.3386/w14282|url=http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation between money and emotional well-being is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Deaton A | title = High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 38 | pages = 16489–93 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20823223 | pmc = 2944762 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011492107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716489K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of money may lead people to ignore leisure time and relationships, both of which may cause and contribute to happiness.&lt;ref name=Aknin09/&gt; The pursuit of money at the risk of jeopardizing one's personal relationships and sacrificing enjoyment from one's leisure activities seems an unwise approach to finding happiness.

Money, or its hectic pursuit, has been shown to hinder people's [[savoring]] ability, or the act of enjoying everyday positive experiences and emotions. In a study looking at working adults, wealthy individuals reported lower levels of savoring ability (the ability to prolong positive emotion) relative to their poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quoidbach J, Dunn EW, Petrides KV, Mikolajczak M | title = Money giveth, money taketh away: the dual effect of wealth on happiness | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–63 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20483819 | doi = 10.1177/0956797610371963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have routinely shown that nations are happier when people's needs are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html |title=Forbes article "Table: The World's Happiest Countries" |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2010-07-14 |access-date=2011-11-12 |first=Francesca |last=Levy  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies suggest, however, that people are happier after spending money on experiences, rather than physical things,&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn EW, Aknin LB, Norton MI | title = Spending money on others promotes happiness | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5870 | pages = 1687–8 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18356530 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150952 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1687D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after spending money on others, rather than themselves.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; However, purchases that buy ‘time’, for instance, cleaners or cooks typically increase individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whillans AV, Dunn EW, Smeets P, Bekkers R, Norton MI | title = Buying time promotes happiness | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 32 | pages = 8523–8527 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28739889 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1706541114 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottery winners report higher levels of happiness immediately following the event. But research shows winner's happiness levels drop and return to normal baseline rates within months to years. This finding suggests money does not cause long-term happiness (1978).&lt;ref name="Brickman_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brickman P, Coates D, Janoff-Bulman R | title = Lottery winners and accident victims: is happiness relative? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 917–27 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 690806 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.36.8.917  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a more recent British study on lottery prizes between £1,000 and £120,000, a positive effect even two years after the event was found, the return to normal being only partial and varying.&lt;ref name=jgao /&gt;

One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1877163 |title=The American Dream or the American Delusion?

Degree of ownership also matter:
“...housing property rights matter for subjective well-being. Specifically, using subjective well-being data from China, the authors find that homeownership is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, although this happiness premium is larger for people who have full ownership compared to those who have only a minor ownership stake in their home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.10.001 |title=Institutions and well-being |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=45 |page=1 |year=2016 |last1=Bennett |first1=Daniel L |last2=Nikolaev |first2=Boris |last3=Aidt |first3=Toke S  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, living in rural areas seems to have some association with well-being, because the included studies tend to control for income and rural areas tend to be poor. Income has a high effect on happiness and incomes are higher in urban areas, so chasing a rural lifestyle at the expense of income may be a ‘grass is always greener’ move.

Adults who live with parents also tend to have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/living-at-home-with-your-parents/8135918|title=Adults living with their parents are Australia’s least happy, survey finds|first=Ange|last=McCormack | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorer levels of well-being.

=== Mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
[[File:Rollercoaster Tornado Avonturenpark Hellendoorn Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Researchers recommend attending to the past to find fond memories, and the future to find hope, but ultimately focussing mostly on the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime/&gt; Daydreaming usually precedes drops in happiness. Mindfulness and activities that bring focus to the present (like roller coasters) may bring happiness partly by shifting people's focus away from the slightly saddening question "Am I happy?".&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering/&gt;&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment/&gt;]]

[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] is an intentionally focused awareness of one's immediate experience. "Focused awareness" is a conscious moment-by-moment attention to situational elements of an experience: i.e., thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and surroundings. An aim of mindfulness is to become grounded in the present moment; one learns to observe the arising and passing of experience. One does not judge the experiences and thoughts, nor do they try to "figure things out" and draw conclusions, or change anything – the challenge during mindfulness is to simply observe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J. (2003) Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom, Shambala, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gunaratana H | year=1992|title=Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=Wisdom Publications|quote="It should be noted that mindfulness is not an evolving term. It has a very distinct longstanding meaning that has remained the same since it was introduced over 2500 years ago. The practice is challenging and requires determination and dedication, particularly when one is starting out. As time passes, the practice becomes more natural."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of mindfulness practice include reduction of stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KW, Ryan RM, Creswell JD  | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness: Theoretical foundations and evidence for its salutary effects | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 211–237 | doi=10.1080/10478400701598298}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reverence (emotion)]].

Ellen J. Langer argued people slip into a state of "mindlessness" by engaging in rote behavior, performing familiar, scripted actions without much cognition, as if on autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wayne | last1 = Weiten | first2 = Dana S. | last2 = Dunn | first3 = Elizabeth Yost | last3 = Hammer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of focusing on present experiences also mention research by Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], who suggested daydreaming, instead of a focus on the present, may impede happiness.&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killingsworth MA, Gilbert DT | title = A wandering mind is an unhappy mind | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6006 | pages = 932 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21071660 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192439 | bibcode = 2010Sci...330..932K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=When the Mind Wanders, Happiness Also Strays | first = John | last = Tierney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2010-11-15|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1&amp;hp|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found evidence to support the harm of daydreaming. Fifteen thousand participants from around the world provided over 650 000 reports (using an online application on their phones that requested data at random times). Killingsworth found people who reported daydreaming soon reported less happiness; daydreaming is extremely common.&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html |title=Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment|work=ted.com|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo (see "Time Perspectives" above) bestowed the merits of a present-focus, and recommended occasional recall of past positive experiences. Reflecting on past positive experiences can influence current mood, and assist in building positive expectations for the future.

There is research that suggests a person's focus influences level of happiness, where thinking too much about happiness can be counter-productive. Rather than asking: "Am I happy?" – which when posed just 4 times a day, starts to decrease happiness, it might well be better to reflect on one's values (e.g., "Can I muster any hope?").&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/06/20/say-no-to-happiness/|publisher=CBC Ideas|title=Say no to happiness|time=about 10 minutes in| first = Todd | last = Kashdan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking different questions can assist in redirecting personal thoughts, and perhaps, lead to taking steps to better apply one's energies. The personal answer to any particular question can lead to positive actions, and hopefulness, which is a very powerful, and positive feeling. Hopefulness is more likely to foster happiness, while feelings of hopelessness tend to undermine happiness.

Todd Kashdan, researcher and author of "Designing Positive Psychology", explained early science's findings should not be overgeneralized or adopted too uncritically. Mindfulness to Kashdan is very resource-intensive processing; he warned it is not simply better at all times. To illustrate, when a task is best performed with very little conscious thought (e.g., a paramedic performing practiced, emergency maneuvers).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Nevertheless, development of the skill lends to its application at certain times, which can be useful for the reasons just described; Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry Richard J. Davidson highly recommends "mindfulness [[meditation]]" for use in the accurate identification and management of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/training-the-emotional-brain|title=Training the Emotional Brain – An Interview with Richard J.

[[Ed Diener]] et al. (1999) suggested this equation: positive emotion – negative emotion = subjective well-being. Since tendency to positive emotion has a correlation of 0.8 with [[extroversion]] and tendency towards negative emotion is indistinguishable from [[neuroticism]], the above equation could also be written as extroversion – neuroticism = happiness. These two traits could account for between 50% to 75% of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diener | first1 = Ed | last2 = Suh | first2 = Eunkook M. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Heidi L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1999 |volume=125|issue=2|pages=276–302|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all referring to the [[Big Five personality traits]] model of personality.

An emotionally stable (the opposite of [[Neuroticism|Neurotic]]) [[personality psychology|personality]] correlates well with happiness. Not only does emotional stability make one less prone to negative emotions, it also predicts higher social intelligence – which helps to manage relationships with others (an important part of being happy, discussed below).&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap"/&gt;

Cultivating an [[Extroversion|extroverted]] [[temperament]] may correlate with happiness for the same reason: it builds relationships and support groups. Some people may be fortunate, from the standpoint of [[Personality psychology|personality theories]] that suggest individuals have control over their long-term behaviors and cognitions. Genetic studies indicate genes for personality (specifically [[extroversion]], [[neuroticism]] and [[conscientiousness]]), and a general factor linking all 5 traits, account for the heritability of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A, Bates TC, Luciano M | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18315789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests there is a happiness gene, the 5-HTT gene.&lt;ref name="Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Happiness Gene Located | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224536.php | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose in life ===
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction. It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction. They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose. Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life). Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.

The [[self-control]] approach, as expounded by [[C. R. Snyder]], focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success. This is further reinforced by a sense of intentionality in both efforts and outcomes.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=David B.|last2=Snyder|first2=C. R.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Hope and the Meaningful Life: Theoretical and Empirical Associations Between Goal–Directed Thinking and Life Meaning|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|year=2005|pages=401–421|issn=0736-7236|doi=10.1521/jscp.24.3.401.65616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intrinsic motivation]] approach of [[Viktor Frankl]] emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness. Attitudinal values are prominent for individuals who are unable to pursue the preceding two classes of values. Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

A personal sense of responsibility is required for the pursuit of the values that give life meaning, but it is the realization that one holds sole responsibility for rendering life meaningful that allows the values to be actualized and life to be given true purpose. Determining what is meaningful for one's self provides a sense of autonomy and control which promotes self-esteem.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism. However, it has also been found to decrease with age.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one's lifetime.&lt;ref name="RyffSinger2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=9|issue=1|year=2006|pages=13–39|issn=1389-4978|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the above theories have self-esteem at their core. Self-esteem is often viewed as the most significant measure of psychological well-being, and highly correlated with many life-regulating skills. Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.

=== Self-efficacy ===
[[Self-efficacy]] refers to a belief that one's ability to accomplish a task is a function of personal effort. Low self-efficacy, or a disconnect between ability and personal effort, is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; by comparison, high self-efficacy is associated with positive change, including overcoming abuse, overcoming eating disorders, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. High self-efficacy also has positive benefits for one's [[immune system]], aids in stress management, and decreases pain.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; A related concept, [[Personal effectiveness]], is primarily concerned with planning and the implementation of methods of accomplishment.

=== Sports ===
According to Bloodworth and McNamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of people's well-being. The influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence, its [[hedonistic]] shallowness and its [[epistemological]] inadequacy.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports, a deficiency in studying this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bloodworth | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Mike | last2 = McNamee | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sport, physical activity and well-being: An objectivist account|journal=Sport, Education and Society|date=August 2012|volume=17|issue=4|page=18|doi=10.1080/13573322.2011.608948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffering ===
{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%| quoted=1 |quote= Research has shown it is possible to help suffering people by building their strengths. In addition, prevention researchers have discovered strengths act as buffers against mental illness. The strengths that represent major strides in prevention include: courage, future mindedness, optimism, faith, work ethic, hope, honesty, perseverance, and the capacity for flow and insight.&lt;ref name=PennUniPPC/&gt;}}
[[Suffering]] can indicate behavior worthy of change, as well as ideas that require a person's careful attention and consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/role-suffering-human-flourishing-contributions-positive-psychology-theology-philosophy/ |title=M Elizabeth Lewis Hall, Richard Langer, Jason Mcmartin.

The [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Positive Psychology Center explains: "Psychology’s concern with remedying human problems is understandable and should certainly not be abandoned.

[[File:Dalai Lama and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|According to Peterson, the Buddhist saying that "life is suffering" can be understood as a reality that humans must accept, as well as a call to cultivate virtues.]]
In reference to the Buddhist saying "Life is suffering", researcher and clinical psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]] suggested this view as realistic, not pessimistic, where acceptance of the reality life is harsh, provides a freedom from the expectation one should always be happy. This realization can assist in the management of inevitable suffering. To Peterson, virtues are important because they provide people with essential tools to escape suffering (e.g., the strength to admit [[cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] truths to themselves). Peterson maintained suffering is made worse by false philosophy (i.e., denial that natural suffering is inevitable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?videoid%3F713852509001 |title=TVO.ORG &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; TVO – Jordan Peterson on The Necessity of Virtue |publisher=TVO |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-07 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] believes positive psychology is "not a luxury", saying "most of Positive Psychology is for all of us, troubled or untroubled, privileged or in privation, suffering or carefree. The pleasures of a good conversation, the strength of gratitude, the benefits of kindness or wisdom or spirituality or humility, the search for meaning and the antidote to "fidgeting until we die" are the birthrights of us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=52 |title=Martin P Seligman.

Positive coping is defined as "a response aimed at diminishing the physical, emotional, and psychological burden that is linked to stressful life events and daily hassles"&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Dinoff, B. L. (1999). Coping: Where have you been? In C. R. Snyder (Ed.), ''Coping: The psychology of what works'' (pp. 3–19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that proper coping strategies will reduce the burden of short-term stress and will help relieve long-term stress. Stress can be reduced by building resources that inhibit or buffer future challenges. For some people, these effective resources could be physiological, psychological or social.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"/&gt;

=== Terror management ===
[[Terror management theory]] maintains that people suffer [[cognitive dissonance]] (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements – symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).

Research has found that strong belief in religious ''or'' secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vail KE, Rothschild ZK, Weise DR, Solomon S, Pyszczynski T, Greenberg J | title = A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–94 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19940284 | doi = 10.1177/1088868309351165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2011/03/episode-81-sacrificial-lambs.html|title=Reasonable Doubts: Episode 81 Sacrificial Lambs|author=Fletcher|work=doubtreligion.blogspot.com}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silton NR, Flannelly KJ, Galek K, Ellison CG | title = Beliefs about God and mental health among American adults | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 1285–96 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 23572240 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the world's poorest countries are the most likely to be religious, and researchers suggest this is because of religion's powerful coping abilities.&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations], Gallup Global Reports, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor], Gallup Global Reports, March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Galen also supports terror management theory as a partial explanation of the above findings.

== Relational factors ==

=== Love and caring ===
The capacity for loving attachments and relationships, especially with parents, is the strongest predictor of well-being later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vaillant|first1=George E. | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=George Eman Vaillant|title=Triumphs of Experience|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067424|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20relationship&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|date=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] writes: "Unlike money, which has at most a small effect, marriage is robustly related to happiness... In my opinion, the [[Correlation does not imply causation|jury is still out on what causes]] the proven fact married people are happier than unmarried people." (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt;). Married persons report higher levels of happiness and well-being than single people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orden SR, Bradburn NM |title=Dimensions of Marriage Happiness |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=715–731 |date=May 1968 |jstor=2775777 |doi=10.1086/224565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data has shown a spouse's happiness depends on the happiness of their partner. When asked, spouses reported similar happiness levels to each other. The data also shows the spouses' happiness level fluctuates similarly to one another. If the husband is having a bad week, the wife will similarly report she had a bad week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoppmann CA, Gerstorf D, Willis SL, Schaie KW | title = Spousal interrelations in happiness in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: considerable similarities in levels and change over time | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21038942 | pmc = 3133667 | doi = 10.1037/a0020788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little data on alternatives like [[polyamory]], although one study stated wife order in polygyny did not have a substantial effect on life or marital satisfaction over all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwanfogbe PN, Schumm WR, Smith M, Furrow JL |title=Polygyny and marital/life satisfaction: An exploratory study from rural Cameroon |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=55–71  |date=January 1997|jstor=41603479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found younger wives were happier than older wives.

On the other hand, at least one large study in Germany found no difference in happiness between married and unmarried people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200303/marriage-is-not-the-key-happiness|title=&lt;/font&gt;Marriage Is Not the Key to Happiness| first = Anne | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that married couples are consistently happier and more satisfied with their life than those who are single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Diener E, Suh EM |year=2000|title=Culture and subjective well-being|location=&lt;/font&gt;Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research findings have indicated that marriage is the only real significant bottom-up predictor of life satisfaction for men and women, and that those people who have a higher life satisfaction prior to marriage, tend to have a happier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Diener, M., &amp; Diener McGavran, M.

Self-reported satisfaction typically drops as the years of marriage roll on, particularly for couples who have children compared to those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201710/defy-the-odds-heres-how-keep-your-relationship-happy|title=Defy the Odds: Here's How to Keep Your Relationship Happy|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decline include a drop in affectionate behaviour. One team of researcher from Northwestern University who summarised the literature in 2013, identifies that this trend does not reverse throughout the marital period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_FinkelSlotterLuchiesWaltonGross_PSci_000.pdf |title=A Brief Intervention to Promote Conflict Reappraisal Preserves Marital Quality Over Time |website=faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the positive relationship between marriage and well-being in the United States since the 1970s. This decline is due to women reporting being less happy than previously and single men reporting being happier than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn ND, Weaver CN | year = 1988 | title = The changing relationship of marital status to reported happiness | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 317–324 | doi=10.2307/351999| jstor = 351999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does exist, however, suggesting that compared to single people, married people have better physical and psychological health and tend to live longer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.043 |title=Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married? |journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=326 |year=2006 |last1=Stutzer |first1=Alois |last2=Frey |first2=Bruno S  | name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, a two-factor theory of love was developed by Barnes and Sternberg. This theory is composed of two components: passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is considered to be an intense longing for a loved one. This love is often experienced through joy and sexual fulfillment, or even through rejection. On the other hand, companionate love is associated with affection, friendship and commitment. Stutzer and Frey (2006) found that the absence of loneliness and the emotional support that promotes self-esteem are both important aspects that contribute to individual well-being within marriage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both passionate and companionate love are the foundations for every variety of love that one may experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes ML, Sternberg RJ | year=1997|contribution=A hierarchical model of love and its prediction of satisfaction in close relationships|editors=R.

Because of the expansive research done on the significance of social support within a marriage, it is important to understand that this research was inspired by a theory called the attachment theory perspective. Attachment theory stresses the importance of support and care giving in a relationship for the development of trust and security. Attachment theory, as conceptualized by Collins and Feeney (2000) is an interpersonal, transactional process that involves one partners caregiving responses.&lt;ref name=pmid10870908&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins NL, Feeney BC | title = A safe haven: an attachment theory perspective on support seeking and caregiving in intimate relationships | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–73 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870908 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthood ===
While the mantle of parenting is sometimes held as the necessary path of adulthood, study findings are actually mixed as to whether parents report higher levels of happiness relative to non-parents. Folk wisdom suggests a child brings partners closer; research has found couples actually become less satisfied after the birth of the first child.&lt;ref name=Twenge03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00574.x |title=Parenthood and Marital Satisfaction: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=574 |year=2003 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Campbell |first2=W.

By contrast, parents' self-report levels of happiness are higher than those of non-parents. This may be due to already happy people having more children than unhappy people. In addition, it might also be that, in the long-term, having children gives more meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By contrast, many studies found having children makes parents less happy.

However, when adults without children are compared to empty nest parents, parenthood is positively associated with emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; People found parenthood to be more stressful in the 1970s than they did in the 1950s. This is thought to be because of social changes in regards to employment and marital status.&lt;ref name=McLanahan87/&gt;

Males apparently become less happy after the birth of a child due to added economic pressure and taking on the role of being a parent.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; A conflict between partners can arise when the couple does not desire traditional roles, or has an increasing number of roles.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; Unequal responsibilities of child-rearing between men and women account for this difference in satisfaction. Fathers who worked and shared an equal part in child-raising responsibilities were found to be the least satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, E., Smith, K. (1996). ''Parenting in the 1990s''.

Researchers implemented the Huta &amp; Ryan Scale: Four Eudaimonic Measurement Questionnaire to analyze the participants eudaimonic motives, through motivation towards activities. The investigation was conducted on Canadian university undergraduates. The four eudaimonic pursuits as described by Huta &amp; Ryan are: 
# "Seeking to pursue excellence or a personal ideal" 
# "Seeking to use the best in yourself" 
# "Seeking to develop a skill, learn, or gain insight into something" 
# "Seeking to do what you believe in".&lt;ref name="Huta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huta|first1=Veronika|title=Huta, Veronika. "Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of Their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling. |journal=Journal of Happiness|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study determined that participants derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their parents had role modeled eudaimonia, but not if their parents had merely verbally endorsed eudaimonia.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

Studies were also conducted on responsiveness and demandingness. The studies participants were American university undergraduates. The terms are described as follows; responsiveness satisfies the basic psychological need for autonomy. This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one's behaviour's values, and true-self. Autonomy is an important psychological factor because it provides the individual with independence. Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision. Responsiveness and demandingness are reported to be good aspects of parenting. The studies report both of these qualities as important factors to well-being.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind's Parent Behaviour Rating Interview. Adaptions of this interview were made into a seventy-five question based survey; participants answered questions organized into fifteen subscales. The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them. A [[multiple regression]] showed that demandingness and responsiveness together explained as much as twenty-eight percent of the variance in eudaimonia, this suggests parenting played a major role in the development of this pursuit. This supported the expectation that eudaimonia is cultivated when parents encourage internal structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision, and simultaneously fulfill a child's needs for autonomy. The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves "mentor" their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia. To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood. Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

=== Social ties ===
In the article "Finding Happiness after Harvard", [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]] concluded a study on what aspects of life are important for "successful living". In the 1940s, Arlie Bock, while in charge of the Harvard Health Services, started a study, selecting 268 Harvard students from graduating classes of 1942, '43, and '44. He sought to identify the aspects of life contributing to "successful living". In 1967, the psychiatrist George Vaillant continued the study, undertaking follow-up interviews to gauge the lives of many of the students. In 2000, Vaillant again interviewed these students as to their progress in life. Vaillant observed: health, close relationships, and how participants dealt with their troubles. Vaillant found a key aspect to successful living is healthy and strong relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shenk J |title=Finding happiness After Harvard |journal=Wilson Quarterly |volume=33 |pages=73–74 |date=Autumn 2009 |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501 |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027190526/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501# |archive-date=2012-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized study from 2008 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported happiness in [[social network]]s may spread from person to person.&lt;ref name=Fowler08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler JH, Christakis NA | title = Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = 768 | pages = a2338 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19056788 | pmc = 2600606 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2338 | author1-link = James H. Fowler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers followed nearly 5000 individuals for 20 years in the long-standing [[Framingham Heart Study]] and found clusters of happiness and unhappiness that spread up to 3 degrees of separation on average. Happiness tended to spread through close relationships like friends, siblings, spouses, and next-door neighbors; researchers reported happiness spread more consistently than unhappiness through the network. Moreover, the structure of the social network appeared to affect happiness, as people who were very central (with many friends, and friends of friends) were significantly happier than those on the network periphery. People closer with others are more likely to be happy themselves.&lt;ref name=Fowler08/&gt; Overall, the results suggest happiness can spread through a population like a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/health/05happy-web.html|title=Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says  |publisher=New York Times|date=December 5, 2008 | first=Pam | last=Belluck | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Stein,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403537.html "Happiness Can Spread Among People Like a Contagion, Study Indicates,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2008, Page A08&lt;/ref&gt; Having a best friend buffers one's negative life experiences.

Neuroeconomist Paul Zak studies morality, oxytocin, and trust, among other variables. Based on research findings, Zak recommends: people hug others more often to get into the habit of feeling trust. He explains "eight hugs a day, you'll be happier, and the world will be a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html|title=Trust, morality -- and oxytocin?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Anderson et al. found that [[sociometric status]] (the amount of respect one has from face-to-face peer group) is significantly and causally related to happiness as measured by [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson C, Kraus MW, Galinsky AD, Keltner D | title = The local-ladder effect: social status and subjective well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22653798 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611434537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional factors ==

=== Education ===

==== Education and intelligence ====
Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anders Ericsson]] argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like [[Theoretical physics]], where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of an Expert

[[Martin Seligman]] has said: "As a professor, I don't like this, but the cerebral virtues—curiosity, love of learning—are less strongly tied to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude and capacity for love."&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;

=== Educational goals ===
John White (2013) investigated the educational goals at public schools in Britain. School-education involves both cognitive and conceptual [[learning]], but also the development social skills and personal development. Ideally, children develop self-confidence, and create purpose for themselves. According to White, in the past schools only focused on [[knowledge]] and [[education]] but now [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has moved to a broader direction. White's Every Child Matters initiative seeks to enhance children's well-being across the range of children's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=John| name-list-format = vanc |title=Education in Well-Being|journal=The Oxford handbook of happiness|pages=540–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical education ====
As a basic building block to a better existence, positive psychology aims to improve the quality of experiences. Within its framework, students could learn to become excited about physical activity. Playing comes natural to children; positive psychology seeks to preserve this zest (a sense of excitement and motivation for life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = January 18, 2013|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = |last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for movement in growing and developing children. If offered in an interesting, challenging and pleasurable way physical activity would thus internalize an authentic feeling of happiness in students. Positive psychology's approach to physical activity could give students the means of acquiring an engaged, pleasant and meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherubini|first=Jeffrey| name-list-format = vanc |title=Positive Psychology and Quality Physical Education|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=September 2009|volume=80|issue=7|pages=42–47, 51|doi=10.1080/07303084.2009.10598356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School education ====
&lt;!-- I don't object to the addition of this study, but it is not appropriately concise, and should accordingly be drastically cut down. --&gt;
Positive psychology is beneficial to schools and students because it encourages individuals to strive to do their best, whereas scolding has the opposite effect. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"&gt;Clifton, D, Rath, T 2005, ‘Every moment matters’, How full is your bucket? Positive strategies for work and life, Gallup Press, New York, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; discussed research conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Hurlock in 1925, where fourth, fifth and sixth graders were either praised, criticized or ignored, based on their work on math problems. Praised students improved by 71%, those criticized improved by 19%, and students provided with no feedback improved a mere 5%. Praise seems an effective method of fostering improvement.

According to Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; ninety nine out of one hundred people prefer the influence of positive people. The benefits include: increased productivity, and contagious positive emotions, which assists one in working to the best of her, or his, abilities. Even a single negative person can ruin the entire positive vibe in an environment. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; cited ‘positive emotions as an essential daily requirement for survival’.

In 2008, in conjunction with the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a whole-of-school implementation of Positive Psychology was undertaken by Geelong Grammar School (Victoria, Australia). This involved training of teaching staff in the principles and skills of positive psychology. Ongoing support was provided by The Positive Psychology Center staff, who remained in-residence for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman M, Ernst R, Gillham J, Reivich K, Links M |title=Positive education: positive psychology and classroom interventions |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=293–311 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/03054980902934563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats, Hupp and Hagley (2008) used positive psychology to explore academic honesty. They identified positive traits displayed by heroes, then determined if the presence of these traits in students predicted future intent to cheat. The results of their research: ‘an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment’ (Staats, Hupp &amp; Hagley, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staats S, Hupp JM, Hagley AM | title = Honesty and heroes: a positive psychology view of heroism and academic honesty | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18792648 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.142.4.357-372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School grades of children ====
According to a study reported in the ''NY Post'' newspaper, 48% of parents reward their children's good grades with cash or something else of meaning. Among many families in the United States, this is controversial. Although psychology experts support the offer of reward for good behavior as a better alternative than the use of punishment for bad behavior, in some circumstances, families cannot afford to give their children an average of 16 dollars for every good grade earned. Alternatives for money include allowing a child extra time on a computer or staying up later than usual. Some psychology experts believe the best reward is praise and encouragement because material rewards can cause long-term negative effects for children.
 
A study, regarding rewards for children, conducted in 1971 by psychologist, Edward L. Deci, at the University of Rochester, is still referenced today. Featured in the ''New York Times'', it focused on the short- and long-term effects of rewards for positive behavior. Deci suggested rewards for positive behavior is an effective incentive for only a short period. At the outset, rewards can support motivation to work hard and strive towards personal goals. However, once rewards cease, children showed less interest in the task relative to participants who never received rewards. Deci pointed out, at a young age, children's natural instinct is to resist people who try to control their behavior, which he cited as support for his conclusion rewards for good behavior have limited effectiveness.

In contrast, the ''New York Times'' featured research findings that supported the merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy regarding the use of rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards at the beginning of the school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, no one method will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Youth development ====
[[Positive Youth Development]] focuses on the promotion of healthy development rather than viewing youth as prone to problems needing to be addressed. This is accomplished through programs and efforts by communities, schools, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="website- Aspe.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Youth Development in the U.S.: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/PositiveYouthDev99/index.htm|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Happiness at work}}

It has been argued that [[happiness at work]] is one of the driving forces behind positive outcomes at work, rather than just being a resultant product.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Lyubomirsky S |title=Does Happiness Promote Career Success? |journal=Journal of Career Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=101–16 |doi=10.1177/1069072707308140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a large body of positive [[psychological research]] into the relationship between happiness and productivity,&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;Carr, A.: "Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Human Strengths" Hove, Brunner-Routledge 2004{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isen |first1=A. |chapter=Positive Affect and Decision-making |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Emotions |edition=2nd  |pages=417–36 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11392858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buss DM | title = The evolution of happiness | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11392858 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; happiness at work has traditionally been seen as a potential by-product of positive outcomes at work, rather than a pathway to success in business. However a growing number of scholars, including Boehm and Lyubomirsky, argue that it should be viewed as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16351326&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Resource Management ====
A practical application of positive psychology is to assist individuals and organizations in identifying strengths so as to increase and sustain well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, various psychological professionals, HR departments, business strategists, and others, are using new methods and techniques to broaden and build upon the strengths of a wide population of individuals. This includes those not suffering from mental illness or disorder. &lt;!-- The phrase "broaden and build" is a reference to the prominent positive psychology theory of Barbara Fredrickson. --&gt;

==== Workplace ====
{{main|Positive psychology in the workplace}}
Positive psychology has been implemented in business management practice, but has faced challenges. Wong &amp; Davey (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/sl_proceedings/2007/wong-davey.pdf |title=Wong &amp; Davey (2007) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted managers can introduce positive psychology to a workplace, but they might struggle with positive ways to apply it to employees. Furthermore, for employees to welcome and commit to positive psychology, its application within an organization must be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. Alex |last1=Linley |first2=Susan |last2=Harrington  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology and Work |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR51T4KHf3AC&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533544-6 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also understand the implementation of positive psychology will not necessarily combat any commitment challenges that exist.

Lyubomirsky et al. report: "Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving, including fulfilling and productive work".

Positive psychology, when applied correctly, can provide employees with a greater opportunity to use skills and vary work duties.

Can an organization implement positive change? Lewis et al. (2007) developed [[appreciative inquiry]] (AI), which is an integrated, organizational-level methodology for approaching [[organizational development]]. Appreciative inquiry is based on the generation of organizational resourcefulness, which is accomplished by accessing a variety of human psychological processes, such as: positive emotional states, imagination, social cohesion, and the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis S, Passmore J, Cantore S |title=Positive psychology and managing change |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=932–4 |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/positive-psychology-managing-change/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new practice in the workplace is recruiting and developing people based on their strengths (what they love to do, are naturally good at and energises them). Standard Chartered Bank pioneered this approach in the early 2000s. More and more organisations are realising the benefit of recruiting people who are in their element in the job as opposed to simply having the right competencies for the job. Aviva, Morrisons (a large UK supermarket) and Starbucks have all adopted this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engagingminds.co.uk/sbr/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/How-strengths-based-recruitment-transforms-organisations.pdf|title=How Strengths-based Recruitment Transforms Organisations|work=engagingminds.co.uk|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] has extensively researched the merit of undertaking good work at one's job. He suggested young generations (particularly in the United States) are taught to focus on the selfish pursuit of money for its own sake, although having money does not engender happiness, and psychological studies show that there is a strong correlation between the wealthy and experience of intensively negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20060630/study-money-wont-make-you-happy|title=Study: Money Won't Make You Happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's proposed alternatives loosely follow the pleasant/good/meaningful life classifications outlined above; he believes young people should be trained to pursue excellence in their field, as well as engagement (see flow, above) in accordance with their moral belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gardner, TVOpodcast ''Excellence in education'', http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bi?1260050400000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminology ===

==== Offender rehabilitation ====
Traditional work with offenders has focused on their deficits (e.g., with respect to socialization, and schooling) and other "criminogenic" risk-factors. Rehabilitation more often than not has taken the form of forced treatment or training, ostensibly for the good of the offender, and the community. Arguably, this approach has shortcomings, suggesting a need to make available additional positive options to treatment staff so they can best assist offenders, and so that offenders can better find their way forward. Positive psychology has made recent inroads with the advent of the "Good Lives Model", developed by Tony Ward, Shadd Maruna, and others. With respect to rehabilitation: "Individuals take part ... because they think that such activities might either improve the quality of their life (an intrinsic goal) or at least look good to judges, parole boards and family members (an extrinsic goal)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Tony | last1 = Ward | first2 = Shadd | last2 = Maruna  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rehabilitation|location=London, New York|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive criminology and positive victimology ====
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and victimology, respectively. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

=== Economics ===
{{merge|Happiness_economics|discuss=Talk:Happiness_economics#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}
In [[economics]], the term well-being is used for one or more [[Numerical data|quantitative]] measures intended to assess the [[quality of life]] of a group, for example, in the [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Happiness economics|economics of happiness]]. As with the related [[cognate]] terms '[[wealth]]' and 'welfare', economics sources often contrast the state with its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Economic Literature'' [[JEL classification codes#Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories|Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories]] at JEL: I3 - Welfare and Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], 1776.

=== Political views ===
Psychologists in the happiness community feel politics should promote population happiness. Politics should also consider level of human happiness among future generations, concern itself with life expectancy, and focus on the reduction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brülde B |title=Happiness, Morality, and Politics |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=567–583 |date=October 2010 |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on political affiliation, some studies argue conservatives, on average, are happier than liberals.

== Environmental factors ==
Living in an environment with more green spaces is associated with higher well-being, partly due to the beneficial effects on psychological relaxation, stress alleviation, increased physical activity, and reduced exposure to air pollutants and noise, among others.&lt;ref name= who&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egorov et al.| year = 2016 | title = Urban green spaces and health: A review of the evidence| journal = World Health Organization  | url = http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/321971/Urban-green-spaces-and-health-review-evidence.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BosGr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, van der Meulen L, Wichers M, Jeronimus BF | title = A Primrose Path?

== Cultural factors ==
{{main|Culture and positive psychology}}

=== Culture ===
People base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them. Well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them, whether that positively or negatively. Whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that culture's type. According to Diener and Suh,
{{quote|[[Collectivistic]] cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being, whereas those [individualistic] societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal [frame of reference] arising from one’s own happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Suh|first2=Eunkook M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Culture and subjective well-being|date=2003|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-262-54146-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Different views on well-being ===
Various cultures have various perspectives on the nature of positive human functioning. For example, studies on [[aversion to happiness]], or fear of happiness, indicates that some individuals and cultures are averse to the experience of happiness, because they believe happiness may cause bad things to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aversion to Happiness Across Cultures: A Review of Where and Why People are Averse to Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2013|volume=15|issue=3|pages=717–735|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence indicates that there are fundamental differences in the ways well-being is construed in Western and non-Western cultures, including the Islamic and East Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring various cultural perspectives on well-being, Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. For example, whereas Western cultures tend to emphasize the absence of negative emotions and autonomy in defining well-being, Eastern cultures tend to emphasize virtuous or religious activity, self-transcendence, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eunkook M. Suh (University of California) and Shigehiro Oishi (University of Minnesota; now at University of Virginia) examined the differences of happiness on an international level and different cultures' views on what creates well-being and happiness. In a study, of over 6,000 students from 43 nations, to identify mean life satisfaction, on a scale of 1–7, the Chinese ranked lowest at 3.3; and Dutch scored the highest at 5.4. When asked how much subjective well-being was ideal, Chinese ranked lowest at 4.5, and Brazilians highest at 6.2, on a scale of 1–7. The study had three main findings: (1) People living in individualistic, rather than collectivist, societies are happier; (2) Psychological attributes referencing the individual are more relevant to Westerners; (3) Self-evaluating happiness levels depend on different cues, and experiences, from one's culture.&lt;ref name="free-books-online.org"&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Eunkook S |year=2002|title=Subjective Well-Being Across Cultures|accessdate= November 23, 2012|url=http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408081703/http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by Chang E. C. showed that Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans have similar levels of optimism but Asian Americans are far more pessimistic than Caucasian Americans. However, there were no major differences in depression across cultures. On the other hand, pessimism was positively linked to [[problem solving]] behaviors for Asian Americans, but was negatively linked for Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lopez SJ, Snyder CR | title = The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Religiousness and spirituality are closely related but distinct topics. [[Religion]] is any organized, and often [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]], system of cultural practices and beliefs pertaining to the meaning of human existence. It occurs within a traditional context such as a formal religious institution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian, R. F.]], &amp; Park, C. L. (Eds.). (2005). Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirituality]], on the other hand, is a general term applied to the process of finding meaning and a better understanding of one's place in the universe. It is the individual or collective search for that which is sacred or meaningful in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George LK, Larson DB, Koenig HG, McCullough ME | year = 2000 | title = Spirituality and health: What we know, what we need to know | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 102–116 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2000.19.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may therefore be religious but not spiritual, and vice versa.

==== Religion ====
{{see also|Psychology of religion|}}

There have been some studies of how [[Religion and happiness|religion relates to happiness]]. Causal relationships remain unclear, but more religion is seen in happier people. Consistent with PERMA, religion may provide a sense of meaning and connection to something bigger, beyond the self. Religion may also provide community membership and hence relationships. Another component may have to do with ritual.&lt;ref&gt;2009 article in Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and happiness have been studied by a number of researchers, and [[religion]] features many elements addressing the components of happiness, as identified by [[positive psychology]]. Its association with happiness is facilitated in part by the social connections of organized religion,&lt;ref name=Routledge2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Are Religious People Happier Than Non-religious People?

There are a number of mechanisms through which religion may make a person happier, including social contact and support that result from religious pursuits, the mental activity that comes with optimism and volunteering, learned coping strategies that enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and psychological factors such as "reason for being." It may also be that religious people engage in behaviors related to good health, such as less [[substance abuse]], since the use of psychotropic substances is sometimes considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baetz M, Toews J | title = Clinical implications of research on religion, spirituality, and mental health | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

The ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' describes a survey by Feigelman (1992) that examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion, in which it was found that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' (see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 122, Oxford University Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-8133-6719-0}}&lt;br /&gt;Feigelman et al. (1992) examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion. Using pooled data from the General Social Surveys conducted between 1972 and 1990, investigators identified more than 20,000 adults for their study. Subjects of particular interest were “disaffiliates”—those who were affiliated with a religion at age 16 but who were not affiliated at the time of the survey (disaffiliates comprised from 4.4% to 6.0% of respondents per year during the 18 years of surveys). “Actives” were defined as persons who reported a religious affiliation at age 16 and a religious affiliation at the time of the survey (these ranged from 84.7% to 79.5% of respondents per year between 1972 and 1990). Happiness was measured by a single question that assessed general happiness (very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). When disaffiliates (n = 1,420) were compared with actives (n = 21,052), 23.9% of disaffiliates indicated they were “very happy, ” as did 34.2% of actives. When the analysis was stratified by marital status, the likelihood of being very happy was about 25% lower (i.e., 10% difference) for married religious disaffiliates compared with married actives. Multiple regression analysis revealed that religious disaffiliation explained only 2% of the variance in overall happiness, after marital status and other covariates were controlled. Investigators concluded that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness (quality rating 7)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Kosmin &amp; Lachman (1993), also cited in this handbook, indicates that people with no religious affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]''(see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 111, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;br /&gt;Currently, approximately 8% of the U.S. population claim no religious affiliation (Kosmin &amp; Lachman, 1993). People with no affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion. In a sample of 850 medically ill men, Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Pieper, et al. (1992) examined whether religious affiliation predicted depression after demographics, medical status, and a measure of religious coping were controlled. They found that, when relevant covariates were controlled, men who indicated that they had "no religious affiliation" had higher scores on the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (an observer-administered rating scale) than did men who identified themselves as moderate Protestants, Catholics, or nontraditional Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of studies by 147 independent investigators found, "the correlation between religiousness and depressive symptoms was -.096, indicating that greater religiousness is mildly associated with fewer symptoms."&lt;ref name=PsyB129 /&gt;

The [[Legatum Prosperity Index]] reflects the repeated finding of research on the science of happiness that there is a positive link between religious engagement and well-being: people who report that God is very important in their lives are on average more satisfied with their lives, after accounting for their income, age and other individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Legatum Prosperity Index, Summary p. 40.&lt;br&gt; Research suggests that religious people's happiness is less vulnerable to fluctuations in economic and political uncertainty, personal unemployment and income changes. The Prosperity Index identifies similar effects at the country level, with a number of highly religious countries reporting higher levels of happiness than might be expected based on the standard of living alone: this effect is most pronounced in Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican republic, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the [[National Opinion Research Centre]] and the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Organisation]] conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]p156, citing [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' Guilford Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts a lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being.
However, the links between religion and happiness are always very broad in nature, highly reliant on scripture and small sample number. To that extent there is a much larger connection between religion and suffering (Lincoln 1034)."&lt;ref name=PsyB129&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith TB, McCullough ME, Poll J | title = Religiousness and depression: evidence for a main effect and the moderating influence of stressful life events | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 614–36 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of [[hypertension]], depression, and clinical delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]] cites similar results from the''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) {{ISBN|978-0-12-417645-4}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better [[self-actualization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hackney |first1=Charles H. |last2=Sanders |first2=Glenn S. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Religiosity and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, drug/alcohol use/abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreira-Almeida A, Neto FL, Koenig HG | title = Religiousness and mental health: a review | journal = Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–50 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16924349 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there remains strong disagreement among scholars about whether the effects of religious observance, particularly attending church or otherwise belonging to religious groups, is due to the spiritual or the social aspects—i.e. those who attend church or belong to similar religious organizations may well be receiving only the effects of the social connections involved. While these benefits are real enough, they may thus be the same one would gain by joining other, secular groups, clubs, or similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam]] makes this argument in his book (with David Campell) ''American Grace'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiousness has often been found to correlate with positive health attributes. People who are more religious show better emotional well-being and lower rates of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other social problems.&lt;ref name = "Donahue_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donahue MJ, Benson PL | year = 1995 | title = Religion and the well-being of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 145–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01328.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six separate factors are cited as evidence for religion's effect on well-being: religion (1) provides social support, (2) supports healthy lifestyles, (3) promotes personality integration, (4) promotes generativity and altruism, (5) provides unique coping strategies, and (6) provides a sense of meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999) ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality.'' New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious individuals experience emotions that create positive connections among people and allow them to express their values and potential. These four emotions are known as "sacred emotions," which are said to be (1) gratitude and appreciation, (2) forgiveness, (3) compassion and empathy, and (4) humility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Emmons, R. A., (2005). Emotion and Religion. In: Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. Paloutzian, Raymond F. (Ed), Park, Crystal L. (Ed), New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, 2005. pp. 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social interaction is necessarily a part of the religious experience. Religiosity has been identified to correlate positively with prosocial behavior in trauma patients, and prosocial behavior is furthermore associated with well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-03828-001|title = The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior.|last = Frazier|first = Patricia | name-list-format = vanc |date = May 2013|journal = Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has stronger associations with well-being in individuals genetically predisposed towards social sensitivity in environments where religion prioritizes social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and Well-being The Moderating Role of Culture and the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) Gene|url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1394|journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date = 2011-11-01|access-date = 2015-04-12|issn = 0022-0221|pages = 1394–1405|volume = 42|issue = 8|doi = 10.1177/0022022111412526|first = Joni Y.|last = Sasaki|first2 = Heejung S.|last2 = Kim|first3 = Jun|last3 = Xu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to greater resilience against stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1805/14103|title = Religiosity and Spirituality as Resiliency Resources: Moderation, Mediation, or Moderated Mediation?|last1 = Reuter|first1 = Kirby K.|last2 = Bigatti|first2 = Silvia M. | name-list-format = vanc |date = March 2014|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi = 10.1111/jssr.12081| hdl = 1805/14103|pmid = |volume=53 |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher measures of self-actualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff RW, Ladd CE | title = POI correlates of a religious commitment inventory | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–4 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5115658 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197110)27:4&lt;502::AID-JCLP2270270431&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in romantic relationships and parental responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Religion or spirituality has positive impact on romantic/marital relationships, child development, research shows|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141208105320.htm|access-date = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits, while being correlational, may come about as a result of becoming more religiously involved. The benefit of having a secure social group likely plays a key part in religion's positive effects. One form of Christian counseling uses religion through talk therapy and assessments to promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1268720312?accountid=14816|title = Clinical Appraisal of Spirituality: In Search of Rapid Assessment Instruments (RAIs) for Christian Counseling|last = Greggo|first = Stephen P | name-list-format = vanc |date = 2012|journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, people who were not Buddhist, but were exposed to Buddhist concepts, scored higher on measures of outgroup acceptance and prosociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Study finds being exposed to Buddhist concepts reduces prejudice and increases prosociality – The Mirror Post|url = http://www.themirrorpost.com/2015/04/study-finds-being-exposed-to-buddhist.html|website = www.themirrorpost.com|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was found not only in Western countries, but also in places where Buddhism is prevalent, indicating a general association of Buddhism with acceptance. This finding seems to indicate that merely encountering a religious belief system such as Buddhism may allow some of its effects to be transferred to nonbelievers.

However, many disagree that the benefits the religious experience are due to their beliefs, and some find there to be no conclusive psychological benefits of belief at all. For example, the health benefit that the elderly gain from going to church may in fact be the'' ''reason they are able to go to church; the less healthy cannot leave their homes. Meta analysis has found that find studies purporting the beneficial results of religiosity often fail to fully represent data correctly due to a number of issues such as self-report bias, the use of inappropriate comparison groups, and the presence of criterion contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does religious belief promote prosociality? A critical examination | vauthors = Galen LW |date = September 2012|journal = Psychol.

They have shown that, when scientifically rigorous studies are performed (by randomizing the patients and preventing them from knowing that they are being prayed for), there is no discernible effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review|last = Masters|first = KS|date = August 2006|journal = Ann Behav Med|doi = 10.1207/s15324796abm3201_3|pmid = 16827626|volume=32|issue = 1|pages=21–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature on Intercessory Prayer|url = http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174|journal = Research on Social Work Practice|date =2007-03-01|access-date = 2015-04-13|issn = 1049-7315|pages = 174–187|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1049731506296170|first = David R.|last = Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion has power as a cohesive social force, and whether or not it is always beneficial is debated. Irrespective of a group's beliefs, many find that simply belonging to a tight social group reduces anxiety and mental health problems. In addition, there may be a degree of self-selectivity amongst the religious; the behavioral benefits they display may simply be common aspects of those who choose to or are able to practice religion. As a result, whether or not religion can be prescribed scientifically as a means of self-betterment is unclear.

==== Spirituality ====
While religion is often formalised and community-oriented, [[spirituality]] tends to be individually based and not as formalised. In a 2014 study, 320 children, ages 8–12, in both public and private schools, were given a Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire assessing the correlation between spirituality and happiness. Spirituality – and not religious practices (praying, attending church services) – correlated positively with the child's happiness; the more spiritual the child was, the happier the child was. Spirituality accounted for about 3–26% of the variance in happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Mark D. |last2=Coleman |first2=Ben |last3=Wallace |first3=Judi M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spirituality, Religiousness, and Happiness in Children Aged 8–12 Years |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=131–50 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation has been found to lead to high activity in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn has been found to correlate with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|title=A 69-year-old monk who scientists call the 'world's happiest man' says the secret to being happy takes just 15 minutes a day|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-happier-according-to-matthieu-ricard-the-worlds-happiest-man-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study using the Oxford happiness questionnaire on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher happiness than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493/&gt; [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people describe themselves as both religious and spiritual, but [[spirituality]] represents just one particular function of religion. Spirituality as related to positive psychology can be defined as "a search for the sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargament KI | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of religion and spirituality? Yes and no. | url = | journal = International Journal for the Psychology of Religion | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3–16 | doi=10.1207/s15327582ijpr0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is defined as sacred can be related to God, life itself, or almost any other facet of existence. It simply must be viewed as having spiritual implications which are transcendent of the individual.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C. R., Lopez, Shane|year=2002|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual well-being addresses this human need for [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] and involves social as well as existential well-being. Spiritual [[well-being]] is associated with various positive outcomes such as better physical and psychological well-being, lower anxiety, less depression, [[self-actualization]], positive relationships with parents, higher rates of positive personality traits and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=James M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|location=New York|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have cautioned to differentiate between correlative and causal associations between spirituality and psychology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways? How wellbeing researchers may be mistaking faith for virtue | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–330 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-010-9630-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching the sacred as a personal goal, also called spiritual striving, has been found to correlate highest with well-being compared to other forms of striving.&lt;ref name=jstor27522349/&gt; This type of striving can improve a sense of self and relationships and creates a connection to the transcendent&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt; Additionally, multiple studies have shown that self-reported spirituality is related to lower rates of mortality and depression and higher rates of happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fehring RJ, Miller JF, Shaw C | title = Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer | journal = Oncology Nursing Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–71 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA | title = Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–61 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224176 | pmc = 1380930 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.87.6.957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most research on spirituality examines ways in which spirituality can help in times of crisis. Spirituality has been found to remain constant when experiencing traumatic events and/or life stressors such as accidents, war, sickness, and death of a loved one. When confronted with an obstacle, people might turn to prayer or meditation. [[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] mechanisms involving spirituality include meditative meditation, creating boundaries to preserve the sacred, spiritual purification to return to the righteous path, and spiritual reframing which focuses on maintaining belief. One clinical application of spirituality and positive psychology research is the "psychospiritual intervention," which represents the potential that spirituality has to increase well-being.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002" /&gt; These coping mechanisms that aim to preserve the sacred have been found by researchers to increase well-being and return the individual back to the sacred.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt;

Overall, spirituality is a process that occurs over a lifetime and includes searching, conserving, and redefining what is sacred in an extremely individualized manner. It does not always have a positive effect and in fact has been associated with very negative events and life changes. Research is lacking in spirituality but it is necessary because spirituality can assist in enhancing the experiences of the uncontrollable parts of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Other factors ==

=== Modernity ===
Much research has pointed at the rising rates of depression, leading people to speculate that modernization may be a factor in the growing percentage of depressed people. One study found that women in urban America were much more likely to experience depression than those in rural Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colla J, Buka S, Harrington D, Murphy JM | title = Depression and modernization: a cross-cultural study of women | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16520885 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-006-0032-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p=0.06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hidaka BH | title = Depression as a disease of modernity: explanations for increasing prevalence | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–14 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22244375 | pmc = 3330161 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe it is the increased number of pressures and expectations, increased isolation, increased individualism, and increased inactivity that contribute to higher rates of depression in modern societies.

=== Weather ===
Some evidence suggests sunnier climates do not predict happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas RE, Lawless NM | title = Does life seem better on a sunny day? Examining the association between daily weather conditions and life satisfaction judgments | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 5 | pages = 872–84 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23607534 | pmc = 3695376 | doi = 10.1037/a0032124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study both Californians and Midwesterners expected the former's happiness ratings to be higher due to a sunnier environment. In fact, the Californian and Midwestern happiness ratings did not show a significant difference.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schkade|first1=David A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title=Does Living in California Make People Happy?

That is not to say weather is never a factor for happiness. Perhaps the changing norms of sunlight cause [[seasonal affective disorder]], which undermines level of happiness.

== Additional future research ==
Positive psychology research and practice is currently conducted and developed in various countries throughout the world. To illustrate, in Canada, Charles Hackney of Briercrest College applies positive psychology to the topic of personal growth through martial arts training; [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]], president of the International Network on Personal Meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaning.ca/ |title=International Network on Personal Meaning and Meaning of Life |publisher=Meaning.ca |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing an existential approach to positive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2009 | chapter = Existential positive psychology | veditors = Lopez SJ | title = Encyclopedia of positive psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 361–368 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT, Ivtzan I, Lomas T | year = 2016 | chapter = Good work: A meaning-centred approach | veditors = Oades LG, Steger MF, Fave AD, Passmore J | title = The Wiley Blackwell handbook of the psychology of positivity and strengths-based approaches at work | location = West Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is framed in the [[second wave positive psychology]] (PP 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2011 | title = Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life | url = | journal = Canadian Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1037/a002251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ivtzan I, Lomas T, Hefferon K, Worth P | year = 2015 | title = Second wave positive psychology: Embracing the dark side of life. | location = London, UK | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Mention MAPP program in England, school based on positive psychology in Australia, etc.--&gt;

The research program ‘Understanding Positive Emotions’ at Human Science Lab, [[London]], investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being work as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive emotions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Positive Emotions"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive and behavioral change, although sometimes slight and complex, can produce an 'intense affect'.

Isen (2009) remarked that further progress requires suitable research methods, and appropriate theories on which to base contemporary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isen AM |year=2009|contribution=Positive Affect as a Source of Human Strength| veditors = Snyder CR, Lopez SJ |title=Handbook of positive psychology|pages=179–195|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang (2008) suggested that researchers have a number of paths to pursue regarding the enhancement of emotional intelligence, even though emotional intelligence does not guarantee the development of positive affect; in short, more study is required to track the gradient of positive affect in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Chang KB | year=2008|chapter=Can We Improve Emotional Intelligence|title=Emotional Intelligence; Perspectives on Educational and Positive Psychology|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location= New York|pages=25–45|isbn=9781433101960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
